This means I must be sponsored by an international NGO, preferably one registered in Israel. One intern supposedly received sponsorship through their country's foreign aid office (not sure which country). I reached out to USAid today. Anyone know another good alternative? Also, if I had a serious connect in Egypt that could possibly work, but I'm not sure I have that.

Does anyone work with an international NGO that would be willing to look into this for me? The organization sponsoring me would not have to claim that I was working for them, but would submit the application form on my behalf.

I lurk here quite a bit, first time posting though. I apologize in advance if the post I'm about to make would fit better in another subreddit. If you let me know, I'll go elsewhere. But as my dilemma is rooted in my faith and convictions, I really wanted to hear what some of you had to say about it.

I am a Christian who firmly believes that homosexuality is not a sin and is a valid lifestyle choice, that women have equal rights as men in matters of church leadership and in marriage (e.g. I'm not a complementarian), does not ascribe to literalism or inerrancy, and doesn't believe in a literal hell. I am not here to debate any of these things, so please don't bring it up.

The reason I tell you these things, though, is because I've been offered a job within the LCMS (Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod) denomination. My stance detailed above is in direct opposition to the LCMS statement of faith. I've already been working the job as an intern and I love it - it has little to do with actual church body stuff and is exclusively focused on promoting social service outreach and volunteering within my community, which are passions of mine.

So here's where I stand: Can I, in good conscience, take this job (they do not require that you be Lutheran or sign the Lutheran confession of faith) even though I know the organization I'll be working for/with marginalizes women and works for the active exclusion of my non-heterosexual brothers and sisters? 

TL;DR: Is working for a denomination whose doctrine is starkly opposed to my own ""selling out"" in my own faith and convictions or trampling on theirs, even though my job has nothing to do with spreading their doctrine/beliefs?"

EDIT:  OK a lot of you say I dont deserve the 60k starting that I aimed for but you dont realize that the average nationwide for ENTRY level e engineering is right about that. I am not the only the one looking for this number and if you read other reddits posts regarding employment you you agree. Also, according to BLS this is accurate.

Reddit trends I noticed:
1) The comments go with one trend and it usually follows the guy with the top votes. The reason for this post was to let put frustration that it's not as easy as ""volunteering"". Most of the comments say it doesnt even matter. Then what the hell does?

2) When something is acceptable in one thread it goes the complete opposite in the other. Many reddit posts say that they DONT even work as much as they anticipated and hence reddit during work( I'm not in today ). A lot of other redditors say the gpa doesn't even matter and that experience does. From what i'm reading in the replies, a good number of you think the opposite. Some guy said it's average for people to have internships ( multiple at fortune 500). 

3) From the comments:  Low gpa is bad, High gpa doesn't matter as much. No experience is bad, 4 internships are average. Basically anything you do is useless ( all according to what I've read so far). I'm not winning this one.

However recently she has moved halfway across the country for a summer internship and so I can't see her regularly. This was going alright until just recently I made some stupid comment about her being healthy and a few other things that deeply hurt her and made her angry with me.

The problem is that this is both of ours first serious relationship and at the beginning of it I made some very stupid mistakes, such as when it started I thought her curly hair was all over the place after a bit of fooling around and called her ""Medusa"" and early on her friends confronted me about upsetting her and while I was talking to them in IM about it I was flirting with her at the same time and she found out. In other words, I very early on destroyed my credibility with what I said being what I mean.

 Another part of the problem is that she has a history of people being cruel to her in that regard, particularly her parents who would consistently berate her for messing up slightly or just make up stuff, thus giving her a low self-esteem. Nowadays, as she has told me, when I do or say something like ""You're pretty"" she thinks that ""He's just saying that to make me happy and doesn't believe it"" or ""He's doesn't actually mean what he says and is just lying to me like other times."" I am also a very predictable person so while I can be spontaneous, my ability to come up with originial things is not my strong suit.

What it boils down to is now we just had a fight over the healthy things and right now she is distraught over it and is finding it very difficult to believe what I am saying and is very afraid that if the relationship continues she will get hurt again. As she said her walls are fully up and not letting me in to prevent her from getting hurt.

After talking with her for a long time tonight to try to come up with something to help us she liked the idea of me being able to do something demonstrate my credibility, some way to show her that I truly mean it when I say that she's beautiful or that I really do like her curly hair or that I won't hurt her again. And right now I'm having trouble thinking of something to do to prove this, I love her, I want to be with her forever, I'm beginning to have to make big life desicions and I want her to be a part of them, I just want her to be happy and not worrying that what I say is a lie. She's willing to work with me but I know that I need to do something big to truly show her that I am credible and not lying to her.

Just to get rid of any possible thoughts, 99% of the time the relationship is good, we do love each other and want this to work, she just, understandably, doesn't want to be hurt and doesn't want to worry about doubting me.

I'm just looking for any ideas that could help me out, thanks in advance for any advice. I'm going to be thinking of ideas all day."

I'm the guy that trolls your ranked games.  Well, one of them.  I'm the guy that bans Veigar and Janna and first picks Gangplank. I'm the guy that will last pick Mordekaiser and demand a solo.  Barring that, I will go bot and likely end up feeding because Mordekaiser is a bad duo (although there was this one time...).
I'm the guy that waits for streamers to join queue so I can hop in and troll them in front of their viewers.  
When our team is Miss Fortune/Warwick/Jarvan/Xin Zhao, I will pick Garen and stack Phantom Dancers.    

But do I intentionally feed?  No, as people who do that are not trolls.  Instead, they are bad players seeking to cover up for their badness by making it look like it was on purpose.  I also do not flame people in all chat and type in all caps unless its absolutely necessary.  That is not trolling, that is people covering up their raging by claiming they are trolling.  

Although I am a relative newcomer to the LoL scene (July last yearish) I have already been involved in all sorts of LoL nonsense.  I was one of the ""creators"" if you will, of that bravery meme [see here](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=166147).  I also was the guy (not to be confused with ParkJayHyuk) who duo-queued with a certain former Riot intern on a certain fateful night involving a certain Ezreal.  Massive [dramas(I'm in the top left)](http://www.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=101978&amp;d=1295249190).

Right now I am contemplating getting my name changed to BRAH drz.

Yes, I have probably been reported many times.  No, I have not been seen in the tribunal yet.  No, I have not actually broken the Summoner's Code (well, maybe not provision IV).  Yes, I will say ""BRAZIL ES BEST HUEHUEHUE""  in your ventrilo.  No, I am actually not Korean-that is a further attempt to irritate players because players will see my Korean name and my limited Korean vocabulary (mostly ssibal) and assume that I am Korean and often end up trolling themselves in the process and then proceeding to shout ""REPORT THE KOREAN GOOK"" in the aftermath.  

Ask away.  ""Why don't you troll normal unranked games?""  ""Why are you tanking my elo?""  ""How come you troll and are in mid-high elo?"" (answer: everyone is in mid-high elo).  ""You're not a troll, two of your top three champions are Jarvan and Renekton!"" (for an answer to that one, guess what items I build on them).

I suppose if you wanted to you could ask me more serious stuff, too.  ""What is your least favorite champion?"" (Poppy... aka, poopy)  ""How did you get your elo that high in the first place?"" (heh ""high"" elo my ass)  ""How good would you be if you tryharded every game?"" (that's a tough one.  I'm a pretty terrible player that uses trolling as an excuse to cover up for my badness, so...)

Anyways, flame away at me and the true terror that I represent.

Some days he won't contact me at all, regardless of whether or not we had plans, and then others he'll be very affectionate and really opens up.

One night last week, he told me that he thinks I'm his best friend.  We vaguely said that we may be officially dating each other again (i.e. not seeing other people) another night.  A few days later, he was being super affectionate and he said he was going to cook dinner for me the next night, and that I should call him when I'm done with my father's appointment.  I called him afterwards, at 2 PM, and he said he'd be over in half an hour.  An hour later, I call him to find out what happened, no answer.  I call him 20 minutes later, because I have other stuff I want to get done if he won't make it.  He doesn't answer again, but sends me a text that he got distracted mattress shopping an hour after that.  I text and ask him when he'll be over, then, and I get nothing (except for a pocket dial at 10pm, sounded like quite the party).  

The next day, I talk to a mutual friend about how frustrating it is to always wait around for him.  The mutual friend eventually tells me that he is seeing another girl on the side--basically, one day me and the other day her.  Around 6PM I decide to send him a text that I'm tired of him being flaky and I wish I could say that to his face, but he'd been AWOL all of that day as well.  I sent this wishing he would respond so I could ask him about the other girl in person, since the mutual friend is known to stir up drama and I wanted to make sure he was telling the truth before jumping to conclusions.  That was Saturday.

As of now, I haven't heard from him.  On Tuesday, I sent him a text asking him if I could get Red Dead Redemption back, since he's been meaning to give it back to me, and I'll be damned if I'll let him keep it if he's going to continue being a douche (I did not say it like that, by the way).  Still nothing.

Part of this could be because he's been acting a bit.. manic lately.  Super hyper, kinda loopy, not going to his internship, etc.

At this point, I'm utterly confused as to why he stopped talking to me and why he was seeing another girl if I'm basically his ""best friend"".  **Also, how the fuck do I get my game back?**

EDIT: TL;DR--Guy I've been seeing has been seeing another girl on the side and won't talk to me all of the sudden... and won't even respond to give me my stuff back.  What do?

EDIT 2:  I do not plan on getting back together with him unless he has an amazing explanation, so this is not a ""how do I get him back"" post."

hovqp,0,2011-06-01,"Hey Reddit! I just got slapped with an MIP, and I need to pay for a lawyer. Any ideas on ways to make some cash in my spare time?",deindar,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hovqp/hey_reddit_i_just_got_slapped_with_an_mip_and_i/,"Hey guys, this is my first real AskReddit submission, so I'm sorry if it's a little sloppy.

Background:
I'm 18 with a declared major in Electrical Engineering, and just finished my first year of college. This summer, I'm living by myself and have a payed, full-time job working as an intern at a government research facility (think OSCORP).  Unfortunately, this doesn't pay that well, so I'm struggling as it is to pay for my apartment, car, insurance, food, etc.

Last night, I was caught in a car with my friends drinking the last bottle of college vodka. All five of us received an MIP, and two of us (myself included) received an open container misdemeanor. As I said, I work for the government, and this kind of shit won't fly if I want to reapply next year. Today, I hired a lawyer to hopefully get the charges dismissed and cleared from my record.

This cost a little over $1000, and I simply don't have that kind of money to throw away. So my question is, what kind of ideas do you guys have for ways I could make money in my spare time? Really any suggestions right now would be great because I'm kind of freaking out! Thank you Reddit!! &lt;3

**TL;DR Got an MIP, and I'm looking for ways to scrounge some extra money on the side to pay for my lawyer**

I am not really a ""recent' college grad anymore, as applying for jobs since last December (2009) hasn't turned up anything. I'm at a total loss right now. I don't know what direction to go in. I didn't know where to go for advice so I figured here I could get some help.

There's very few Project Manager jobs around for entry level, and my internship, while helpful, isn't enough. Most Project Manager job offers around here may as well be internal postings with the requirements for previous experience in the company or crazy requirements I could never fill without at least two other Project Manager jobs.

I don't know what I should be focusing on to help my cause, or if I should be going for certifications (though they don't look like anything practical in a real world experience.)

Please, if anyone even reads this, no insults on my part for not being able to find a real job. I feel bad enough. I may not have been trying my extreme hardest, but I've been trying pretty hard. It's not easy to look at a job list full of door to door salesmen offers, go to backdoor interviews for going door to door selling cable packages on cold contact, and phone calls that go nowhere, and placement companies that sabotage you for no explainable reason.

I just want some help. Or some direction. Please?"
hoso8,2,2011-06-01,How do I know whether I should just move on or if I should fight for her?,repressitol,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hoso8/how_do_i_know_whether_i_should_just_move_on_or_if/,"I met a girl about six months ago. The long and short of it is that I am in love with her. I'm going to be a senior in college in the Fall and she just graduated. She got an internship and moved 900 miles away and basically I don't know what to do now. 


We have had a few conversations about our relationship. Originally we didn't talk about the situation at all but made a plan for me to come visit her right away. I soon started to feel like she was getting a bit distant. I finally decided to tell her that if we were eventually just gonna break up it would be really hard for me to get over her and maybe coming to visit wasn't a good idea. She agreed. I spent the next three days in absolute misery. I felt like I couldn't move on because it wasn't me she was rejecting it was the distance. I finally asked her to tell me that she didn't want to be with me and she said she couldn't because she wouldn't mean it. 


I thought about this for a bit and decided that if that was true I wanted to continue seeing her over the summer(I have plenty of free time to make trips). She took some time to think about it but came back and said this was already hard enough and if we keep it going in the summer and break it off in the Fall it would just be even harder. She said she really wanted to remain close friends and I said I needed time.


So here's where I'm at. I haven't spoken to her in two days and am just sitting here wondering if I should keep fighting for her or just try and move on with my life. Part of me thinks there is something I can say or do that will make her realize I will do whatever it takes, and another part of me feels like she is just telling me what I want to hear to make me think she cared about me more than she really did. 

TL;DR: Possible girl of my dreams moved 900 miles away, do I fight for her or move on?"

Halp!?",tehfluent,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/horea/without_fail_dress_slacks_are_too_tight_in_the/,"Over the past five months I've lost over 50 pounds (currently 195). For the first time in my life, clothes generally fit without much issue. However, this simply is not the case for dress slacks - particularly in the crotch area. My internship this summer requires business casual (which can interpreted as slacks, dress shirt, no tie, no coat), and finding pants that adhere to dress code and are comfortable is obscenely difficult.

At 6'2, and with another 20-25 pounds to lose, it seems as though I have to wear my pants up pretty high to be able to tuck my shirt in within the last button flopping out. If I wear pants where they are more comfortable, sitting closer to my hips like I wear chinos or denim, I'm unable to tuck the shirt in and have it stay. Moreover, when the pants sit so high, my socks show more than they should when sitting.

This scenario was the last thing I expected after finally reaching a normal/healthy weight. What gives? Any suggestions? Do I just need to continue searching for the right fit? Any ideas for particular brands that might fare better?

If pictures of my descriptions would be helpful, I can grab some tomorrow evening after work."

horaq,8,2011-05-31,"Reddit, what's the worst internship experience you've had?",The20KiloFox,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/horaq/reddit_whats_the_worst_internship_experience/,"I worked in Washington DC as an unpaid intern to a local politician.  Going into the internship, I was told it would be full-time work with flexible hours due to the nature of the work.


What I got instead was a 9am-7pm Monday through Friday work schedule, and that was just the beginning.  In addition to those mandated hours, there were other functions that we would have attend, putting each intern at 60+ hours/week.  Unpaid.  


Although we suggested doing shifts (as there were enough interns where it could be closer to a normal full-time schedule per person), it was quickly shot down by the boss.  As per his words, ""This a volunteership, not an unpaid internship"".  Both my title and the job description included the word ""intern"".  As such, I suppose we did not receive the same (relative) protection as unpaid interns, but we could still be fired, which the boss did to those who disagreed with his practices and ethics.


Long story short, I quit after three weeks.  Although sometimes there were interesting experiences, the extreme amount of bullshit work (find concert tickets at the last minute for a VERY well-known artist, for example) was not worth it.  Besides the three weeks at the office, I lost a valuable summer work experience as other organizations were no longer hiring at that point.


I think mine was bad, but I'm sure there has to be worse.  So, Reddit, what internship horror stories do you have?"

I recently (past few months) actively began looking for a job again and tried asking my alumni network on linkedin if they had any contacts in the communications industry. Fast forward a few weeks and I get an interview/face-to-face with the founder and CEO of my company who is an alum of my college. I didnt get the internship at first but this past friday they opened up a new internship and offered it to me. I start on thursday!!!! 

I basically worked a few hours everyday so getting my ability to go somewhere for a weekend is fucking nice. I might even just sleep for 20 hours straight just because I can do it. Plus it could turn into a fulltime position and even if it doesnt I get references, experience and referrals. 

I would never never never have even been considered with the experience that I have. I know I interview well but I wasnt even getting interviews before that. 

So remember guys, you fucking have to work any angle you can get that gives you a leg up and networking is a great way to separate yourself a bit.

I had to tell you guys because I have gotten a ton of good advice from you all including about how important networking is. Thank you all for helping me keep my head up. Hopefully some of you guys are in a better place soon if you feel like you need to be. Hopefully it was today me and tomorrow you.

Before deciding that I wanted to pursue my passion through engineering, I merely completed some general education classes. For the fall semester class-wise, I have my intro engineering class, calculus I, Chem I and lab, humanities. These are foundation courses, but I entered the Bioengineering (electrical) speciality.


I have always been interested in the inner workings of electronics since I could rip them apart as a kid, but I entered university thinking Id just lazily spend the rest of my life as a police officer. I considered electrical engineering but I was fascinated by the description of the bioengineering program. 


Provided I do well in my classes and pursue my education further (I am even devoting my summer to studying beforehand), I am set on replacing my major to electrical engineering at the least. From what I have heard, I would have to pursue even more education past my bachelors to even have a shot at bioengineering. Even then, the field is only emerging. Also, Bioengineering gives a general biology overview while covering the basics of electrical engineering. Is bioengineering not non accredited? This is a big fear for me as well. I would still be interested in pursuing bioengineering after I get my electrical engineering degree, I hope.


But that is not all... I am obsessed with the idea of securely landing a job or well-paid internship after I graduate. I am cursed with my obsession of planning for the future. After reading [this](http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm) this page, a part of me has been egging me on to switch over to civil or environmental engineering (my university only also has mechanical engineering, IIRC).

hq2d0,1,2011-06-02,What I expect from Ron Paul's candidacy,[deleted],ronpaul,https://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/hq2d0/what_i_expect_from_ron_pauls_candidacy/,"I want to run down the play book a little. So that 1) I know what to expect and 2) everyone else knows what to expect.

First, we can all agree that the real economy is in shambles. From an Austrian POV, there's not much room for debate. Now, if the economy ""collapses"" (it's always subjective about what characterizes a collapse), then Ron Paul becomes President Paul in a landslide victory. So first off, I'll say that I do not expect the economy to collapse until after November of 2012. I expect the Fed and the government to continue allow the increase of the budget and trade deficits.

I think that's important information for anyone still vested in American dollars.

Second, I expect a skew of the poll data from the mainstream media. Most people who follow Ron Paul already know about this. I expect Ron Paul to be minimized in the media, most obviously by straw polls, which organizations can repeat over and over until they get the expected results. And since they're private, no one can make them publish results that favor Ron Paul.

No matter how much we support Ron Paul, we have to remember this. Even if it seems like work to click on yet another Ron Paul poll, we should probably still do it.

Polls will be of one of the following forms: 1) Ron Paul is not featured 2) Ron Paul is featured with a loaded question (""Should someone who wants to legalize drugs be elected President?"") 3) Same as two but eviscerating a more emotional response, eg. ""Can someone who wants to end the war in Afghanistan keep Americans safe from terrorists?"" These are questions for which many people will go out of their way to have their answers on record.

Then I expect some kind of scandal. I doubt it will be the [""October Surprise""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_surprise) of the election, but it may well be if they don't come up with anything more objectionable.

There will undoubtedly be something I don't know about Ron Paul coming to light which I am expected to condemn. It will be false in its manifestation (either it really happened, and it's a twisted presentation in the media, OR they paid someone some money to say something like, I don't know -- Ron Paul likes to wear studded leathers during group orgies). 

Given that October Surprises are generally for incumbent Presidents, I'm expecting some very small thing to be whipped up so that it looks like a very big thing. Whether he forgot some bureaucratic thing on a form, and now it looks like he cheated on his taxes, or one of his interns comes forward with something entirely false. It would not surprise me if covert operations are used. Based on my trust-level of the American government, I'm expecting it. Eg, a small bag of cocaine shows up somewhere, which no one in the mainstream media will allege was planted there. 

What I expect from the Republicans is to be completely divided and have the appearance of disorganization. Lots of money thrown to the ""future puppet president"" (Romney? we've had nothing but puppets since JFK, IMO). This will cause dissent within the party.

Then Ron Paul can be maligned through his party affiliations. By-proxy, Ron Paul will appear to be a terrible leader, unable to consolidate his own party. It will be wondered by the talking heads on TV, whether *any* republican is fit to be President -- minimizing Paul through the generalization -- given the chaotic infighting of the Republican Party.

All that being said, Ron Paul's a pretty smart dude, and I wish him the best. I think he's likely our last chance at a President chosen by the people, and not by shadow entities and covert groups.

**TL;DR:** I think if you're going to support Ron Paul, you have to become familiar with old and new political maneuvers. You have to make the choice *now* to vote for him, before your mind gets fuck*d with."

I'm a student within the graphic design field trying to make ends meet, and it's not going too well. I've already borrowed from family and that's not an option anymore, I'm in desperate need of some freelance work. Please, help me help you.

Ok, enough whining. As said, I am a graphic designer with the printed media as a speciality. I do logos, identities, posters, covers, typesetting, ads etc. I'm currently at an unpaid internship (it's a part of school) at an ad agency. The last couple of months I've worked towards the ad industry with Burger King as the biggest client (POP material for their restaurants) and I've typeset ads that's been printed in some of Sweden's biggest magazines.

Summer vacation is coming up and I really need both money and something to pass the time, since my summer job doesn't start until July 4th.

Please PM for further information, rates and contact info.

hpxu2,7,2011-06-02,Redditors I need to know if I'm justified...,archetypical,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hpxu2/redditors_i_need_to_know_if_im_justified/,"Recently I just got an internship at a radio station (which is what I am going to school for) and was hired after my 100 hours were up for my internship. My girlfriend was right behind me, wanting me to succeed and knowing that the two of us would be seeing a lot less of one another because I worked from 8pm-4am (sometimes 8am) and had to sleep during the day.

It's been almost a month of me working and I've seen her as much as I can (maybe 8 times in the past month? So 2 times a week) and she has started getting angry when I say I can't see her because I need to sleep due to working that night. She just doesn't understand that seeing her means I have to sacrifice my sleep and stay up for 22+ hours in a day, then go to work on little to no sleep. On top of it, she has become increasingly clingy and I've noticed myself getting short tempered with her because of it.

I want to take a break from each other but I found out after her last ex broke up with her (she wasn't even devoted to the relationship at the end of it because he broke up with her for drugs) she stepped infront of a bus and tried to kill herself. She is head-over-heals in love with me, but I think some space might be good, I'm just afraid she will try to hurt herself and I'm not sure how to go about doing it. Clearly my attitude has changed towards her since I haven't really talked with her much in the last two weeks.

Reddit, what should I do?

TL;DR: New job that forces me to work nights. Seeing my girlfriend means I don't get sleep. She is becoming a little overwhelming. Should I end it with her?"

Right now my thoughts on what to do, where to go, how to do it, in my life are jumbled and all over the place, and even my thoughts as of at the moment are scattered as I struggle to make this post coherent to have some semblance of flow to it.

I graduated last year from the University of California, San Diego (yay, go Tritons, I suppose) with a B.S in Physiology and Neuroscience. It was supposed to be a stepping stone to medical school. Coming from a decently traditional Asian background, my entire life I had the concept of ""YOU are an Asian male, you are going to be either an engineer or a doctor"" drilled into me. It wasn't something I ever particularly enjoyed doing - I would take my courses to graduate on time just because I had to do it. At the time, I didn't even consider other opportunities. And these classes were especially difficult. Compounding with the fact that I didn't really care or have a passion for the material I was learning, I was content with getting by with average grades (overall 3.04 GPA), and just going to class and immediately going back to my apartment if it was possible. 

I graduated, studied to take the MCAT (30R), and at some point afterwards, I simply said ""Fuck it."" Fuck me for spending my college education doing something not for me, but for others. How can I even consider going to medical school when I don't have the academics to get my foot in the door in the first place? I was angry mostly at myself that I had been blindly trying to fulfill not my own ambitions and goals, but someone else's. 

But what do I do now, then? I didn't take the time to take courses of my choosing during college; I never got to find out what I would really enjoy doing for a career. 

Morale and self-confidence was/is at an all-time low; I couldn't find a job for the past year - I got about two interviews total. I am living at home with my parents with no income to call my own.

I have several random options that I have considered at the moment. I have no idea what they'll turn into or how I'm going to reach those goals, but I'll try to lay it out the best I can. 

1) I lied to you earlier. I actually did find the time to take a year of Japanese language my final year in college, and I had very much enjoyed it, being it the only non-science courses I've taken in years. I applied to JET this past year, but I didn't make it to the interview stage. I plan to reapply this year, so I was looking for ways to see whether or not I liked to actually teach, as I had never really done it before. I began volunteering once a week for an ESL position. Turns out, I love it. I was given several students to work with week after week; these ladies, several of whom had never had a formal education in their entire lives, could eventually read simple stories, write simple sentences, and converse with me in English. It's a great thing to be able to see where your work and effort become in the progress of others. I really hope I get accepted into JET this coming year. Unfortunately, I don't know what would become of me if I get in, go abroad, and come back after a year or two.

2) As mentioned in the prior paragraph, I discovered I really enjoy working closely with several individuals, and seeing my efforts through their progress. I did a little research and I came to the decision that perhaps physical therapy would be best suited for someone of my nature, with it involving science as a plus, since I had graduated with a similar degree. Also, it seems like a more viable career path than going abroad for a couple years (which, to be honest, is a farfetched idea. I don't think I'm qualified at all). I immediately ran into issues.

There was no way I was going to be able to apply on time this year. I have to volunteer about 150 hours minimum with hands on experience, three letters of recommendation from physical therapists, and I have to go back to school to take even more courses. On top of that, coincidentally, because of my degree, I had already completed a good portion of the courses (with the low grades), so I have a bunch of courses I cannot retake for a higher grade, putting my prerequisite GPA at about a 3.0, whereas most applicants get in with a 3.5+. To top things off, if everything went completely smoothly (yeah, right) with no problems, the earliest I could expect to enter the program would be 2013 - two years from now. At the earliest. While I did manage to be accepted into a good hospital internship, I don't know if my efforts will yield results in the end - everything seems to go wrong for me at some point or another. 

I don't know what else to say. I have no idea where I'll end up, no idea what I'll end up doing, and I feel I keep backtracking because I am afraid that more failures would set me back even more years - I feel awful that I wasted a year doing pretty much nothing. I just feel that others out there are/were perhaps in the same position as me, and have found a way to make themselves happy and successful in their lives. I would appreciate any input anyone has to offer.

TLDR: I fail at life, need advice."

A lot of this I attribute to studying my ass off up until middle school, giving me the tools to basically blow off my high school and college courses so far with little effort, using logic and common sense to bullshit my way through hw, tests, essays, etc. . . However, throughout this time, I have had little direction and have have no dreams or aspirations, and honestly, after everything, I really don't know that much since I just blew through everything. Now, I'm getting into the real world and I can't just blow shit off and be highly regarded. I started a tech / major related internship this summer and it has really hit me-- I am lazy, don't enjoy my work, and most of all, I'm woefully incompetent in my field, leading to great levels of anxiety. I'm at a point where I honestly feel I could be fired at any point (pretty sure my blood pressure is rising too lol). I can't understand or even remember my bosses tech briefs and I feel like I am just not in the right place.

Its not like I never saw this coming either--In the back of my head, I always knew something like this would happen. Through my years of laziness and isolation, I have developed none of the skills necessary to succeed. Sure, I've dealt with depression and drug use, but I don't think those are the sole factors in my aimless disposition. I've always expected to eventually become successful and happy, but I never really lived life. . .

Why bust my ass working all day on something I hate and is causing me to feel so feel stupid. It isn't that I don't want to be good at whatever I do. I would love to have an easy job and kill the hell out of it every day than have a hard job and struggle everyday and end up doing a mediocre job that disappoints others. On the other hand, I fear if I go that route, I'll feel forever ashamed and guilty of being a worthless pos.

I know I'm not the only lazy asshole out there, so does anyone else have similar experiences or advice? Sorry this was long, but thanks for any replies! (Throwaway account)


TL:DR: I'm lazy, breezed through school earning top marks, have no skills, suck at/loathe work. Want general advice."
hr5f2,0,2011-06-03,Questions about working with old books (100 years or older),[deleted],history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hr5f2/questions_about_working_with_old_books_100_years/,"Hey reddit! So this summer I am an intern for the local branch of the State Museum. They have this immense un-inventoried collection of old books. My job is to go through and inventory all of them, or at least as much as I can. (There are 70+ boxes on the floor I'm on, and I've been told many more in the basement, with more still off site.) Each box can have anywhere from 15-40 books depending on their size so I'm only expecting to get those 70 boxes done this summer. 

My question is, are there any precautions I need to take when handling these old books? I'm already using some medical gloves for my hands but anything else? Oldest book so far was 235 years old btw.

**TL;DR?** I'm working with super old books, how do i not destroy them in the process of inventorying them. Thanks."
hr4a6,14,2011-06-03,Help... What do you do when you have a crazy and racist mother?,throwaway1419,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hr4a6/help_what_do_you_do_when_you_have_a_crazy_and/,"So this is what has been happening these past 3 weeks. I am 21 years old, currently on an internship. 

My mom found out I had a boyfriend 3 weeks ago. He is pakistani, I am chinese. I convinced her it was only a four month relationship, whereas it was actually 1.5 years so far. 

My dad freaked out and disowned me. His mother is now praying that I marry him soon so that I will get cheated on because he will for sure marry multiple wives and I will come crying back to my father in defeat. This isn't too much of a change for me because my dad has never really had much of a relationship with me, so it's like nothing happened between us basically. We just never talk to each other anymore. 

My mom is cursing my dad's mom for saying that, wanted to find a place to buy a gun so she could kill her and then herself so I won't be 'cursed'. Hopefully, this has passed and she isn't thinking about that anymore. At the time, she was threatening to also take my cat to a shelter, and I was so angry I said if she did that, I was going to move out. This prompted the following deal, where I agreed to her conditions of being ""open-minded"" and going out on dates secretly if a guy asks me out (behind my bf's back). She claims that she knows me so well and that I won't ever break up with him unless he breaks up with me, which is when he gets married. She says that women are disadvantaged because as they get older, they have a smaller pool of men to choose from so I better start now and not just fixate on one guy. I tell her I will date more guys eventually, she refuses to believe me. 

She continues to worry and cry over the fact that I was going to leave and then writes me a long email saying 'this is my last piece of advice for you, whenever you think of me, please read this'. She says she's going to leave the house so I don't leave because if I leave, I will most definitely get raped and killed living on my own. I tell her I was only going to leave because of a fit of madness and she was all relieved and glad to be able to stay and that I wasn't going to leave. But she still keeps saying that she's scared I'll leave to this day. 

Now, even though I agree to her conditions, she keeps lecturing me every day, about how pakistanis are bad, because they're poor and have large families and don't respect women etc etc. They have a law in which polygamy is okay, so he's going to have many wives and I will live a miserable life if I stay with him. She claims I've become a terrorist. This happens every day. She asks me when I come home where I've been, who I've been with. If I was with my bf, she will freak out and start lecturing me even further. She says she's researched assassins and knows how much they cost. However, she's been not working, has gotten a warning from her superiors to work because all she does is cry at work all day long. I thought she had stopped when I agreed to the conditions awhile back, but apparently she hasn't. She's lost weight, can't sleep properly... 

Then along with that, she's been monitoring my phone bill to see who I've been talking to etc and claims I've been ""webcamming"" with him at night. And that he will eventually make me ""take off my clothes"" for his base desires and then my life will be RUINED because they will get onto the internet and everyone will find out and my employers will fire me and nobody will ever hire me again.

Basically, she's controlled my entire life and these past few years, I've been trying to break out of it, quite unsuccessfully.

She said that because I've been ""webcamming"" with him, that she will HAVE to sleep in my room at night every night from now on. She will even sleep on the floor. At this point, I was just so angry from all the pent-up frustration of constraint from the past couple of weeks, I completely ignored her and slept on the couch while she waited in my room. She completely went nuts and started accusing my bf of putting me up to this. I wrote her a super long email about how she ruined my life (long story, basically she's cheap and overworked me, I turned out bad-tempered, cheap, self-conscious, no ambition, low self-esteem for a multitude of reasons that I don't feel like going into) and she should see a therapist/psychologist because of her irrational desire to control my life and my brother's life (she hovers over his shoulder all night to make sure he's working and not gaming or something. And he's almost finished Grade 10).

She reacted very negatively. Cried a lot, wrote me a response because she couldn't say it out loud or else she'd start crying. Basically her response blamed my boyfriend for everything. I told her about how good he was to me, how he is smart and caring, how he made me a better person, how he gave me confidence, self esteem, a goal in life. She shat on all of it, somehow twisting everything into a bad thing, and then additionally saying that he is poor.

She basically spent her entire life scrounging up money for me and my brother to go to med school. I broke out of that path like a year ago, which was ALSO a huge deal, with lots of crying and emotions. I told her it was all for naught and that she puts too big of an emphasis on money, and that relationships and happiness are more important. She just keeps saying that money is important and because he has a large family and they're poorer than us, I will just end up having to use all my money supporting his family.

I begged her to see things my way and to see that she was way overreacting for something like a boyfriend. It isn't working. She's about to lose her job. She says she doesn't care about her job anymore because she's lost her daughter.

I don't know what to do. The right thing to do would be to break up with him wouldn't it? But I've already made her miserable by telling her all that stuff about her ruining my life and being overly controlling. Even if I break up with him, she may still be miserable and still lose her job.

I also don't want her to win yet again. I really truly want her to see a therapist so she can stop worrying so much. She has more white hairs than her own mother because she worries so much. 

Please help, I'm just so confused and frustrated and cornered and I feel helpless. "
hr38f,5,2011-06-03,I have some sort of issue with my relationships...,[deleted],ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/hr38f/i_have_some_sort_of_issue_with_my_relationships/,"Hello, I'm an 18 year old male and for a while now I have been reflecting on some of my issues. I seem to have a problem with maintaining my relationships (both platonic and romantic). 

When I was in my senior year of high-school I became very attached to my best friend L(18 year old female). L and I have always been close but towards the end of high-school I began developing a crush on her and soon discovered she had one on me. We began dating and spent a lot of time with each other during an internship we both were accepted into. We basically spent everyday after school together. At this point I started to become jealous when she would hang around with ANYBODY male or female. I also became suspicious of her actions, thinking that she was lying to me. We eventually broke up and haven't spoken since then. Lost a best friend because of immaturity.

Fast forward to my Freshman year of college. My roommate T is a friend from high-school I use to hang around with in a group. We got pretty close and as we did I noticed myself becoming attached to my GUY friend. I became just as jealous as I did in my relationship with my ex. I began thinking that he would ditch me for another friend at school that we knew and became upset/angry whenever I wasn't invited or included in the conversation. The thought of betrayal appeared in my mind constantly and would always upset me. Now that it is summer I feel even worse because T rarely wants to hang out and is always hanging out with his friends at home. Which I understand because we were just away at college for two full semesters, who wouldn't want to be hanging out with old friends all summer? But what about me? 

I feel as though with any type of relationship I get very jealous and clingy and I don't know why. Just to clarify, in case anybody thought so, I do not have romantic feelings for my male roommate T. i am a straight male. So I know it has nothing to do with me having romantic feelings for my guy friend. Its more of a general clinginess towards anyone who I become close to. 

It's beginning to affect me emotionally. I don't want to feel jealous and upset whenever I'm left out of a hangout or conversation when it comes to a friend. The way I'm acting is immature and I really just want to stop acting so negatively. And I definitely do not want to push my future significant others away because I'm too insecure. **So I'm asking for help and a constructive discussion on what I should do about this. And possibly an answer for why I'm like this.**

**Shortened:** 18 year old straight male who is clingy and becomes very jealous concerning his relationships both platonic and romantic.

**Also, I'm not willing to see a therapist at this time. I might reconsider after college is over and Ive moved into my own place, but for now, no therapy.**"

I have a summer internship sort of thing with a semi professional baseball club in upstate NY.  Specifically, I work with the [Albany Athletics](http://www.albanyathletics.com/), a team associated with the [AABC](http://www.aabc.us/view/aabc/about-us).  Recently, the team has sent players to the majors, participated in national championships, and consistently won their league.  My role is to sell sponsorships and advertising space to local businesses to help bring in money for the team to travel and compete.  I have had next to no luck thus far and figured I would reach out to Reddit for some possible help.

**Some details**: 

We send out a detailed media guide throughout the state and sell space within that for your advertisement.  These range from $40-$255 depending on size and location.

The team also hosts a 3 day tournament and invites other teams from around the northeast to travel and come participate. 

1. 
Title sponsor for this event is $1800.  For example, the tournament would be called ""AskReddit's Baseball Fest"".  This also includes a full page ad in the media guide, web site listing, newspaper exposure, and some other benefits.  

1. 
I can also get you a 4' by 8' vinyl sign for $600.  This includes full page ad in the media guide as well.

You don't need to own a business or product for this!  Which is why I'm posting on Reddit.  I'm hoping that some people want to get together, pool their efforts, and make designs for whatever they want people to see.

*I get paid only on commission and will be using the money I would be making to subsidize your cost create a discount for any redditors who are interested.  *

In the end, it's putting money toward helping these young guys play their game and possibly make their dreams come true.  We can simultaneously get some lulz or actually advertise something worthwhile.

Thanks!

Here we are again. I'm leaning on a collective group of female (and sometimes male) strangers to pick me up again. I don't know how I get into these situations. Basically, my boyfriend, call him Steve, called me a ""manpulative cunt"" when I asked him not to explode at me. Apparently, in his mind, I yelled and swore at him ""every fucking day"" and thus his insult was justified. The only time I ever raised my voice to him was to explain myself and my feelings, to try and make myself heard, it didn't work. He called me all kinds of names, saying things like ""No wonder your relationships never last because you're a huge fucking bitch!"" Problem was, I moved to this city just recently and was staying with Steve and his family until I found my own place. Now I'm typing this from a friend's couch, who lives further away from the city. I start my internship (dead smack downtown) on Tuesday, and all my stuff and my dog are at his house because his mom offered to keep them there, that she'd take care of my dog for me. I went to see an apartment today after breaking up with him, and met another obstacle; the apartment that I thought would be best (move in in 6 days) doesn't allow dogs even though the agent said they did, but only found out after double-checking. I'm completely and totally emotionally drained, and burst out crying at random. But I got out before I let a cycle begin. And for that I am proud of myself, even though I feel so utterly downtrodden and disoriented. My family is over 3,000 miles away. My dog has an ear and eye infection, which I need to give daily medication for, but she's not in my care. I have a tiny car with over 14 boxes and a cabinet left at Steve's. I have three friends in this general area, over 60 miles apart. Utterly at a loss for what to do besides call that landlord and get a storage unit and get my dog to a friend's house in the meantime. Don't know if I should start my internship because I don't know if I'd start crying out of nowhere from stress, but I need money. Not asking for it, though. I'm thinking myself into a spiral.

I got a chance to have an internship at Mumbai. The internship will be 1 year long. Thus I have some questions and/or worries before getting too serious.

First of all does Indian people have any prejudices about Turks or muslims?

Secondly,the company offers a salary of 300 dolars a month (i guess it makes around 15k rupees). Do you think it is a satisfactory amount? What would be the quality of life I would have? (Plz explain in detail, like what kind of accomodation I would get, How often I would eat out etc..)

Finally, I wanna know about the food :D What kind of food awaits me?

Not so important, but I would like to know the alcohol regulations too."

It just frustrates me that some of my longest friends haven't even been out of their own state, and when I ask them why, they never have any real answer, I blame it on the fact that we have no ocean up here.

I also have all sorts of orientation that I'll need to take off for, and I'll probably end up leaving early for marching band.

I've spent the last two years helping senior citizens in my town with computer problems, and I'd ideally like to get something related to IT work; I'd find an internship helping someone administer computers interesting. However, looking at craigslist, everyone's either looking for college students or is stationed over 45 minutes from my house. 

My question is, perhaps is there some other place that's better for looking for jobs? Should I put out something like an ad in the local papers asking for an internship, or would that get me nowhere?"

There were some FANTASTIC answers (which helped break the monotony of going through hundreds of sheets of paper). These are my favorites (not because I agree with them... but they were damn funny!):

How can you prevent pregnancy?
'bum sex', 'kick the wham' (womb?!), 'coat hanger', 'birth period'

How can you prevent the spread of STDs?
'tattoo needles', 'oral sex', 'just don't have sex, ok?', 'youse protection', 'don't touch boys', 'don't do a blow job', 'don't get them [STDs]', 'kill everyone'

What are some examples of hormonal birth control?
'1) Pull 2) Out', 'AIDS', 'oral', 'oral contraceptic', 'the nova ring', 'the circle thing and the cup thing', 'spermicide', 'girl condom', 

What else would you like to learn about?
'vaginas', 'how to find the g-spot', 'females', 'celebrities who have STDs', 'ways to satisfy yourself if you're practicing abstinence', 'seasonique - I have REALLY bad cramps!', 'penis's', 'my science test'

And finally... who knew there were so many ways to spell 'abstinence?!':
absanis, abstnise, abstanece, abstance, abstatonce, absetence, absetencee, absanance, absumnece, abtience, abstenice, abtenense, abstininse, absedense, abstillinse, absence, absanince, abstinces, absenence, abstidence, abstincence, absenonce, abstidence... and abstencs

Needless to say, I actually laughed out loud at some of these!

I landed an two-month summer internship in Seattle that will last from June 15 - August 15. Though I'm uber excited, finding housing is turning out to be a major headache! My office is located in Belltown in the 2000 block of 1st Avenue. I'm not sure yet if I'm bringing my car, so somewhere with public transportation to that area would be helpful! My budget is around $1300 per month... Ideally that would include everything.  

The places I've looked at with short-term, furnished apartments (Belltown Inn, Short Term Suites) are all full for my dates/price range. I've also looked at other apartments in the area who are seemingly a good price (Archstone), but apparently that only applies to a 12-month lease! I've also checked out Craigslist and found a couple of awesome places, but alas, no reply.

I'm open to a studio/one bedroom or having roommates. My move out date is relatively flexible, but I'd like to be moved in by this weekend. Sorry for the extremely short notice, but I just found out Thursday! If any of you need a roommate/subletter or know someone who does, I'd greatly appreciate you sending a little info my way! 

About me: I'm a 21 year old girl (22 in July!) that just graduated in public relations from LSU. I'm clean, responsible, don't smoke, no pets, and a really nice person (no passive aggressiveness here!) I love to travel and will probably be taking lots of weekend road trips. I can share food or not, whatever. I can provide as many references as you want, my Facebook page, whatever! "

I currently have a gaming desktop (955BE, 6870, in an antec 1200) and a netbook (asus 1018p) for school. I am doing a summer internship which will involve a lot of document generation. I had planned on using my netbook despite it being somewhat inconvenient. However, the networking software required caused my system to hang on login, and no amount of changing the startup options would help. While I could borrow a laptop on a daily basis from my employer, I am also considering putting together a cheap system with a larger display. 

The advantages for work would be a larger display for multiple documents, which would be very nice, as well as a snappier system overall. However, since this a fair amount of money I also intend to get more out of this system after this internship is over. In that vein, I would like to have the system convert into a lan party case or a server. I would also be able to run dual monitors on my main system.

In undergrad I originally wanted a job, but decided on grad school given the job outlook.

I'm planning on graduating in December, and have been debating all year whether I should go for a PhD or not.  I've heard many times that a PhD would probably preclude me from many kinds of jobs in industry, and I don't think I want to go into academia (for now at least).  However, I do enjoy doing research.  I'd also like to be done with school by my late 20's.  I like learning new things, getting to work with all sorts of expensive equipment and tools that I could never afford, and my lab mates are great.

I never got an internship or co-op in industry during my undergrad unfortunately; all my relevant work experience has been in the lab.  That, and I got a CS minor in my undergrad so I try to program and toy with computers in my spare time.

What do you think?

What followed was about 3 months of pain and confusion, caused by us staying close to one another on both emotional and physical levels, as well as by really shitty behavior on both of our parts. We eventually decided that we wanted to get back together, but this was at early April. Unfortunately she was going away for a summer internship, so we decided to put our plans on hold until she returned at the end of the summer.

So, basically we decided that while we wanted to be together, we should wait, and then give it a shot when we can have a real go at it.

I thought this would work fine, and would give me some time to get over some of the awful things we did to one another. Plus, I would finally have some distance so that I could actually sit back and evaluate everything that has happened.

so far, it is going terribly. I am putting on a happy face for her, so that she isn't constantly bothered by my insecurities and doubts. I don't want to scare her away by making her think that when she gets back together with me she will be greeted by a depressed version of myself. Who wants to be with someone like that? that is why from now on it is all smiles and telling her how awesome my summer is going.

We have made plans to visit each other, and I am going next weekend to see her. Basically I am constantly worried that she is hooking up with other people, and whenever I start putting myself out there, I feel guilty, thinking about how much it might hurt her if I was with someone else.

The whole thing seems unsustainable, looking forward to three months of constant doubt, pain, and distrust. I don't want to make her rush into things, because I really do want to make things work when we try again. She was always my closest friend and confidant, and now that I have to hide my pain from her for fear of scaring her away, it is torture. I fell like I am going to explode from all of the feeling swirling around in my head.

I can't work and I can barely get through the day without crying. I don't know what to do. Any advice on how to tell her how I am feeling, without coming off as an insecure wreck?

EDIT: I am 22, she is 21

EDIT2: I am getting some conflicting advice. Some say to talk with her about exclusivity, others say to bear the pain and focus on myself, and others say to walk away completely. Tough to know what to do here..."

We are both 21 yo. For the past 6 months I have been concerned that I am not able to experience life to the fullest. Immediately before dating my current boyfriend, I was in a 2 year relationship. I just feel like my entire adult life will be spent with another human being at my side, influencing my thoughts and actions. I don't feel inhibited, like there are things I wish I could do but can't because I'm in a relationship. I just think if we were separate, I would have a better self-realization and I really think that he would too. I love my boyfriend, I don't want to feel this way, I wish so much that I could ignore this burning desire to experience independence. 

My doubts of our relationship have been affecting our entire relationship. We have not been having sex as frequently as we used to. I have been fantasizing sexually about other people, including co-workers. I don't enjoy the way he smells. He does not smell bad, I used to love the way he smells, but now I avoid his breath at all cost. I get very short with him, arguing at little things, and I try not to, but I lack proper emotional control. 

We fell in love very fast and have had rough times throughout our relationship, going to different schools for a period of time and dealing with my depression. He is moving out of our place for an internship for 3 months. I am hoping to experience enough alone time to realize myself, but still being committed to someone does not give the full independent experience I think I'm looking for. I want this to work. He is my best friend, I want us to stay together. I also want to be sure of myself and sure of us and have him be sure of himself. Is it better to just break things off? Or should I stick with it and stay with him and work through my issues so we can eventually have a loving family.... Should I wait to make a decision after he's been gone for some time?"

Please help me help him.,scaredformyboyfriend,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hrbe3/my_boyfriend_thought_about_killing_himself_and_is/,"Reddit, I think I need your help. I've been dating a wonderful guy for the past year; he's smart, funny, and absolutely one of the best human beings I know. The problem is that I am convinced he has serious depression and so far has not received help for it.

The story: He was seemed like a normal enough happy guy when I met him a year ago, but sometimes he'd get pessimistic and sad out of the blue and start saying things like ""Why does everyone think life is worth living and has a point?"" He's a philosophy major, so at first I just thought this was hypothetical discourse and talked about it academically. This kept on happening on and off a couple of months after we started dating until one day we went out to the local pizza place and I guess it was a bad day, he started sobbing in the car and told me about the time when he was in high school and he was all set up in his fathers garage to kill himself but somehow couldn't bring himself to do it. We both cried and he agreed to go to the campus psych center and get some counseling. He went and the psychologist tried to tell him he has A.D.D. (which may or may not be true, but it wasn't really the issue he was there to seek out help for). So he stopped going but it was soon pretty clear that this wasn't some passing event. I think it might have been in his childhood too. I asked him why he never did more activities as a kid and he said that he didn't want to bother his parents and make them have to take time to come to practices or games or anything like that (and I know his parents and sisters and they are not negligent or mean parents).

Sometimes when I spent the night at his place, he bolts up in the middle of the night in a panic. I don't mean like whiny, attention-seeking behavior, I'm talking real mental distress. After a party once, with his friend crashing on the couch outside his bedroom, I made a silly joke about death as we were dozing off and he freaked out and bolted out of bed to the front yard and it took a good fifteen minutes to calm him down and convince him to go back inside. That's happened twice since I've known him, but generally he doesn't talk about his depression or his thoughts (to 'not worry me') and I thought it might have calmed down until he graduated a few weeks ago. He applied to a fellowship and a teach-English-in-China program. The fellowship rejected him and he told me plainly that he doesn't want to go to China, but 'what else can he do'? His friends are slowly leaving town for their own careers and he's convinced he will never do anything with his degree because he has no interests or passion for anything. He tried going back to the clinic once more after that but they seem to be going in the wrong direction and counseling him on 'changing his negative thoughts' but I don't think he even told them the full extent of his depression.

He's a smart, wonderful man but he's plagued by these feelings that it's too late for him, he's squandered all his opportunities, and he won't ever do anything with his life but worry me and he wants better than that for me. It breaks my heart to see him like this and I stay up at night worrying about him. I can't do much in person right now because I'm 300 miles away on a research internship until August but I desperately need to find help for him. I don't even know what I'd do if he hurt himself or worse. His parents and friends don't know, I don't think, but I don't want to tell them. Counseling isn't helping him and he's been getting more and more depressed since graduation in May. I asked him when the last time he thought about suicide was a couple of days ago and he said 'yesterday'.

Please Reddit, I love this man and I want to spend my life with him. Please tell me what I can do or where I can find help for him so he doesn't have to live this way.

Edit: I posted this in /r/Askreddit, which is apparently a bad idea. Please just don't tell me to leave him and get on with my life. This is not manipulation, this is not a teenage phase, this is quite real and scary."

I don't even know what I'd do if he hurt himself or worse. His parents and friends don't know, I don't think, but I don't want to tell them. Counseling isn't helping him and he's been getting more and more depressed since graduation in May. I asked him when the last time he thought about suicide was a couple of days ago and he said 'yesterday'.

Please Reddit, I love this man and I want to spend my life with him. Please tell me what I can do or where I can find help for him so he doesn't have to live this way. "

We do have similar interests, such as video games, playing soccer, etc, but I am concerned about the potential conflict of interest. 

As I type this, I know I can't pursue this any further... Also, I do not want to quit my job/ask for a transfer as I am up for promotion and feel comfortable with my professional life (mid twenties, $70,000/yr up to $100,000 after promotion. 

What would you do in my position?

(Advice?),[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/hra2f/what_the_heck_is_going_on_advice/,"First off, I actually never been on an ""official"" date with a girl before. My best friend for 4yrs is a girl and we go out together a lot, but that really doesn't count.

Her: White, recently new to NYC(staying with sister) and looking for a job/ internship, might goto Paris for a year if she cant find a job by end of summer. 

Me: Asian, living in NJ and work in NYC.

So, I met this girl 2 weeks ago and I have no idea what's going on. We've only met once on Saturday night and we've been texting each other since then. We text back and forth until tuesday following that meeting and then she suddenly stop responding for the next 5 days. So, being an idiot that I am...I emailed her(2nd saturday) and said thanks and goodbye. She emailed back saying ""why the goodbye"" and that she ""had fun and would like to hang out again"". She had been busy with her friend visiting NYC.

Anyway, we texted each other on tuesday and haven't heard from her since. I just text her today(friday) asking how her job search was going and gave her a website that might help. No respond yet, so I'm just letting her be until she reply...

What do you think reddit? Is this going anywhere and is she even remotely interested? Is this normally what you girls do? I'd like to hear a woman perspective on this :P

I just want to know so I can freaking stop wondering and thinking about her...also, some advice on what to do would be nice :D

man, I'm over analyzing and I sound like a total loser...but hey, it's reddit!

As graduation fast approaches (December of this year), I find myself freaking out. The stress is constantly with me. Is my portfolio good enough (I know I need more), am I a good enough designer, am I going to be able to find a job. 

I often get so bogged down with the stress that I cannot even design personal projects. I currently have a design job with an on-campus marketing firm, but I am looking for an internship outside that will give me more experience. I have also begun some work on personal branding, which hopefully will set me apart from others. My wonderful girlfriend (who is also a designer) and I are moving up to Seattle from Colorado after graduation. We plan on contacting  design firms in the next few months here to get some information, and will be taking a trip up there in the near future.

How do you deal with design related stress?

 Also on a slightly unrelated note, I am thinking of purchasing an android tablet (in a few months) that I can display my portfolio on during interviews. What do you think of that?"

I did an internship in China for 5 months and during that time I had the change to find a address where you could make custom stuff. It’s actually very funny, if you know your stores in China you can get exact replicas of suits, shoes and whatever.  Just show them enough pictures and they provide.

Pictures of my trip are here: http://tabbypower.imgur.com/suitness#7Nj6j

Getting a custom-made suit was a dream for this young lad. Somehow a suit is the only guy-only thing left in fashion (to my own humble opinion) and I was pretty excited. Together with three friends we went to that store and it was actually pretty funny.

Somewhere in a very small place there was this custom place. I was standing in the living room of a few Chinese people and I got three books where I could choose every fabric, style and way I wanted the suit, the choices where overwhelming. For my first suit I had chosen a shiny material as a suit and we awaited the results, within two weeks I got a suit for around 60 dollars(650 yuan I think), custom made.

Felt really good to have my own suit, so I made an order for a second suit, this time a black suit with a small stripe. Main problem of a suit is when I got my suit I started to read on the internet and learned that a suit is an learn. A tie, belt, watch, socks, underwear, hairstyle and shirt are all related to your style and the type of suit you should wear.

Ow yeah.. another thing I should mention. The shiny suit is a 2 button one, and the black one a three button one. Should make better pictures of the shiny suit.

For my shiny suit I went to a special tie-store and got the advice to go bold and pick a purple shiny tie and go all out. For my black suit a yellow tie with a pattern. Every suit a different tie.

Anyway, AMA if you want to know anything. I have to find my ties and make pictures of it if you like!

So please, if you happen to be a super detective, keep that shit to yourself and do me a solid and not post your discovery here.  Thanks in advance.

/end of rant

I'm still trying to piece together what exactly happened, it's been a few years and some of the details are not clear to me.  I'll do my best to remember and regurgitate it onto nosleep for you fine folks.  Actually, no sleep is the reason I'm posting this.  Reading through a number of posts made me think about what experiences I had been privy to.  Then like a brick to the face I remembered November of 2006.  I remember the month and year exactly because the game F.E.A.R had just come out and I was playing it quite frequently at work after hours.

Some background first.  I had just graduated college that year with a totally useless BFA.  And now I was interning at an office (I'm leaving some pertinent details out on purpose) back in my home town.  The office building isn't your typical brick and mortar stack.  They had renovated an old church which was originally built in the 20's.  Again, not a typical church by any means.  The main rotunda where most of the cubicles are is gigantic, with a diameter of about 125-150 feet.  I'm not exaggerating on the math, the area is gigantic.  All over are sections of Herman Miller cubicles.  On one wall is a two story tall 5000 pipe organ which the owners had fixed and hooked up to a computer.  Anything midi would play through the massive pipes and fill the room with incredibly robust organ music.  It was really quite impressive the first few times I heard it play.  It did the opening to 'Light My Fire' really well, and 'Stairway to Heaven' was also really cool to hear.  They mostly turned it on when clients came for a tour.

Around the second story of the organ, is a balcony which surrounds the entire rotunda, wrapping around the edges.  In the back is an ascending set of pews that was originally used to seat the choir, but now functions as a lecture area for visiting classes of students.  The ceiling, which is very detailed with little plaster inlays and the like, had chandeliers which provided next to no light.  The chandeliers were easily 40 feet off the ground, and attached to the ceiling which sloped from the outside of the rotunda inward into an oculus.  The oculus was roughly 60 feet off the ground level where everyone worked.  It has a sky painted on it and is lit by lights positioned behind a ledge around it.  I had been up there a few times through an 'attic' access.  The only other lighting was this really annoying 'emergency' lighting that was installed to provide adequate lighting.  But they were these hideous white florescent fixtures that were attached to various spots, and pointing up, because the ceiling was too high to mount anything reasonable.  

My apologizes for the long winded description, but I can't help but feel like it helps me to delay writing the whole point of this post.

At the time, I lived in an apartment complex less than six blocks from the office.  So getting to and from work was a casual walk past shops, a few bars and a fair number of pedestrians.  But when I walked the last block around the bend to the office, it was always very desolate.  There were people once in a while, but it's on an off street and didn't have a lot of foot traffic.  So the area adjacent to the building was always dark at night, other than the landscape and building lighting.

Now, getting to the point, I can't help but hesitate as I type knowing in my rational mind that what happened couldn't have possibly happened outside of my own active imagination.  But it doesn't really take away the feeling that I had, and still have when I recall the details.

When I started working there, I was hired as an IT intern, which didn't really consist of much work other than troubleshooting and menial tasks.  I did get my own cubicle though, which was on the far corner of the main rotunda, with my back to the two story organ.

The head of IT was in the cubicle next to mine so he could easily call for me and give me things to do.  I was lucky to have a very fast workstation, which when paired with a spare video card I had, made for an excellent gaming rig.  In fact it was better than my home computer by a long stretch.  I had free reign to stay as long as I wanted after work as long as I didn't log billable hours when not actually doing any work.  So I often stayed till 8-9 at night playing games, skyping, and taking advantage of their insane internet connection.  I also had to make sure before I left that nobody else was there when I set the alarm.  

They often had people working on projects very late, and took their security very seriously.  Each entrance had RFID locks, and within the building itself there were doors everywhere that had RFID locks on them to prevent wandering clients from entering confidential areas.  They also had cameras outside looking over the parking lot and at each doorway.  Even my security code for the alarm was tied to my social security number.  So if I locked the place, they knew it was me who did it, in addition to the security footage of me leaving.  The whole place was designed to passively secure.  Not iron bars everywhere, but rather ways to track who did what, where and when.
So I made sure to check each level of the building before I left at night.  First using the intercom, then if there was no answer to the extension I broadcasted, walking to each level to double check.

From where I sat at my desk, I could hear every sound from the rotunda, and the hallway that wrapped around the outside of it.  So doors opening, etc, I could hear very clearly.  I was always freaked out when I heard the main employee door opening and shutting late at night.  All the double doors facing outside were metal and made a loud clunking noise when the maglock was release and when opened and closed.  On the inside between departments were solid glass doors, which also made the clunking noise when unlocked with a wave of an RFID card.  So whenever I heard that familiar clunk I knew somebody was unlocking the door and either leaving or entering.

One afternoon I got the game F.E.A.R in the mail at work.  I had everything sent there as my apartment didn't have a mailroom and it was just easier.  I had heard a lot about the game, and I was giddy with excitement to play a paranormal fps.  It seemed like such a cool idea at the time.  I also loved being scared by choice.  Not shocked like hostel or saw or the bullshit omen remake.  I hate the kind of gay shit where the screen flashes to a demon head accompanied by a 1000 decibel screeching which startles you more than frightens you.  What I always loved were the spine tingling experiences, Alien and Aliens, The Thing, etc.  Dark corners containing who knows what, in an isolated foreign environment.  Hell yeah.

I started playing F.E.A.R (for sake of typing, refered to as FEAR henceforth my good sirs) the moment the head of IT left for the day around 4.  Nobody ever passed by my corner of the room, so I could do whatever I wanted really.  I was playing with headphones on and got really immersed in the game.  I hadn't even noticed the hours tick by until the lights went off.  I stared up at the ceiling, paused my game and muttered ""Fuck, every god damn time"" under my breath.  But I knew that when the lights went off, it was past 9.  They always blink 10 minutes before they shut off at 9.  It wasn't pitch black by any means.  All the annoying ground level florescent lights still lit the room decently enough, but in a very pale way.  I knew I wasn't done with the game so I got up and walked to the end of the rotunda to press a little button which override the light timer for an hour, and the lights in the rotunda flickered back to life.  As I walked past the giant pipe organ I heard a very loud banging sound from the balcony area.  I stopped in my tracks for a second and then breathed a sigh of relief when I remember that the building still had the original vents for heating around the perimeter of the balcony by the two story tall windows the encircled the rotunda.  It was the heat kicking on and it occasionally caused the old vents to shudder.

I sat back down at my desk, unpaused the game and put my headphones on.  This part, I remember very vividly, it still makes me a little uneasy thinking back on it.  About a minute after I started playing again, my character was walking down an empty hall when I heard very distant children's singing.  I took my hands off the keyboard and sat there with my headphones on, not sure if it was coming from the game or not.  I took my headphones off and the singing stopped.  I put the headphones on again but didn't hear the singing.  This really spooked me, a person who doesn't mind playing a game like fear alone in an office that's decidedly creepy at night.

I took the headphones off again and held them in my hands, listening to my own breathing with what I'm sure was a very skeptical look on my face.  I actually shook my head, thinking how silly I was being.  As I started to lift my hands to put my headphones back on, I heard the child singing again, clear as a bell.  I literally froze in place, staring at my computer screen.  The voice was again, very distant, but was clearly coming from within the room.  There was no mistake about it.  I couldn't make out the words being said, and to be honest, the chills I get now thinking about it pale in comparison to the bone numbing chill I had going through my body at the time.  I sat there for what couldn't have been longer than 10 seconds, listening to that voice for what felt like an eternity.  I could not fucking believe what I was hearing.

As abruptly as it started, it stopped, and I couldn't move an inch, my breathing halted and I listened carefully.  Sitting there for a solid minute I decided it was time to call it a night.  My first thought was to book it for the door as fast as I could manage, and sprint home.  But I knew I was probably just imagining the voice, a result of playing a horror genre game for hours after a full day of work.  I was scared regardless, and quickly closed out fear and put my computer to sleep.  As I was gathering my things into my bag, I heard the familiar maglock by the employee entrance unlocking with a clunk and the door opening and shutting.  The relief that washed over me was intense, a veritable wave of happiness coursed through my body.  I very casually threw the last of my items into my bag as I heard footsteps coming from the front door.  I made my way to the hallway to greet my savior before I left.  Just as I opened the side door near my cubicle and saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I glance over my right shoulder at the pipe organ with it's plethora of exposed pipes and stopped for a moment to scan the pipes.  I saw a feint shadow that seemed out of place on the far end, on the second story of the pipes.  It looked like a different color shadow, like it was being cast through an opaque sheet of glass.  Then it moved.  Not a trees shadow kind of movement, but a very deliberate movement away from the organ.  I know this because it grew in size like it was moving towards a light source.  My entire body was instantly covered with goosebumps and my eyes opened wide before I said, ""Fuck that"" to myself and walked quickly through the door into the hallway.  I heard the glass door around the corner unlock with that same clunk, and almost ran in that direction to at least feel the presence of a familiar person.  As I rounded the corner, I pushed on the glass door just before it closed and found myself alone in the front reception area.  I called very meekly down hallway opposite the reception area across from me.  My heart quite literally sank, knowing that I had just heard the outside door unlock, footsteps enter, walk down this hallway and my grip was on the handle of a clear door which had just been walked through.

To be quite honest, at that point I thought I had to be hallucinating.  I heard those doors open all the time, and playing that game was making my imagination run wild.  I walked to the employee door facing the parking lot, entered my security code and walked out of the building.  I should also mention that the head IT guy was a huge fan of lost, and made the alarm countdown sound, which played throughout the intercom system, the same as the hatch countdown sound.  That made me feel oddly relieved hearing that sound.

Please don't read this section if you haven't finished the story, some spoilers kinda.  You've been warned.

Edit:  I still keep in touch with the head of IT there, so I'm going to try to get in there next weekend and take some pictures of the locations I'm talking about.  I think they'll give you a better idea of how the space felt to stand in.  I'll just post them in this thread.  And thanks for the kind words from everybody.

Edit 2: I think it would be better to shoot a video of my steps in addition to the photos.  That should give a good sense of the space and exactly how everything is oriented.  It's a bit tough to explain the floor plan of the place with words, it's very complex.

Edit 3 Update: I spoke with the head of IT guy today, he still works there thankfully.  He wrote me that it wouldn't be a problem, he said this weekend was going to be busy for them and I could just buzz my way in.  He said he'd make a key so I could get access to the server room to take a snapshot of it.  It's kind of his baby and he's proud of how organized it is, so I think he was pleased as punch that I want to take a photo of it.  I don't know who's working this weekend or if I know them, but I'll head over there Saturday afternoon.  And I'm taking a friend with me because the thought of going through that corridor still gives me the creeps.  There's a 100% chance of this video going up, I'm not going to pull some bullshit where I stop responding a day beforehand to pretend like the ghost killed me for returning or something fucktarded like that.  I'll do my best to give a walking tour.  Should be interesting, I haven't been back there since."

It's striking, it has put me in the sort of mood I guess where this will be therapeutic, but it's also confirmed the fact I've known about myself for the past 10 years or so, and that is I never really care about anything. Nothing really excites me, nothing ever really upsets me. Having said that, the last few weeks, I guess the last few months, haven't been particularly good. I finally moved house, and even though it's an awesome place and probably better than the previous joint, I still don't feel settled, I sleep on the couch more than my bed, I rarely cook and all I seem to do is play ps3 and watch tv. Not to mention the outrageousness of my betfair account. In all honesty, I think it's at 6.5k down, after this weekend's 1k splash where the idea was to make back last weekend's 0.5k loss (and then in all likelihood, ""go for profit""). Even though I have the aforementioned apathy/lack of extreme moods, I think it's affected me. 

Then there's where I'm at with women. I did have pictures in my head at the beginning of this year that kristy and I would be a thing. She was even making it pretty obvious that we should've been. I was complacent about it, then paid the price when that mofo scott came along. I still don't know their full story, I assume they met at the end of term party i didn't go to because of me going to canada, and the rest just followed. It truthfully probably doubly upset me because it was the same scott that seemed to effortlessly get emma at the end of last year. The cream on the cake of this secret angst was of course that he was working in ward 4 all term when I was doing gen med up there, which has just finished. Frankly I think that would've upset me even if the kristy thing didn't happen, I just can't get on with him. I had a moment last night or maybe even today, where I was thinking about Amy. Not that I terribly miss her or that i even have much guilt about how that all went down, but just thinking where I'd be in life had I have called her back and kept things going. I'd most likely be living here with her, I'd be all grown up, but instead I'm 25 and spending most weekends at home, drinking and gambling. Smoking the last couple of weeks too. It's really kinda pathetic, but it's this culmination that's prompted this “bent paperclip” this time around and frankly I think it's helping. 

Not to mention of course the necessary angst that goes with starting a new term tomorrow, that being respiratory med. I've of course landed myself on the team that has Curtwall in it, which concerns me because it was him last year that had a go at me in theatres for not knowing anything. Truth be told I've been lucky with consultants this year, where none of them have been particularly taxing or upsetting. Frankly, Tony was a barrel of laughs, and the only ones I was under regularly last term were the gastro ones, where peterson scratched the surface of me not knowing much but I just got away with it. Hollings was always into the questions too but cared more about george. I pulled out the toronto notes to have a look at the resp chapter, saw that it was 45 pages long, thought it quite reasonable, had the day to read it, and didn't. It's a motivation issue, I kind of knew in myself I wasn't going to touch it. It was all ps3, tv and a miniscule amount of the book “it”, which I'm only reading cos bec asked me the other day if i'd read it when she was going through my bookshelf. 

I should elaborate further, even just for my own benefit, on the girls situation. Two nights ago was the RMO changeover party, and I left before it kicked on at that nightclub nextdoor to it, with Pip, where it was music to my ears that she didn't want to go in when we were in the line. Pip's always been a bit of a nothing in all of this regard, but when we were at home again and going to put a dvd on, i really wanted her to sit on the couch with me, but she of course chose the other one. I don't know if it was just a drunken throwback to how emma and i would've watched something or if i was desperately lonely or if i have a thing for pip. Probably a mix of all three, come to think of it. Then there's old faithful, Laura. It truthfully surprises me that our one time of actual sex turned out to be the only time. She was keen for it the following weeks, but I can't recall why that didn't carry on. Fucking 18 months ago now, that's probably the longest I've been not having sex since i started. Which, who am i kidding, wasn't that long ago anyway. Anywho, I've brought her up because I was at john's for xmas eve last year, and she was straight up cold to me. Not like, playing hard to get, but just not interested. She was drunk and sitting next to me and felt uncomfortable when i was leaned up on her when we were watching that bizarre film on john's computer. So, I don't think i've seen her since then. She seems to be hitting up the clubs a lot more and basically talking about her sexting and various hook ups she's had going on, which is like, whatever. But the last couple of weeks, it's gone back to days of old where the fb chatting turns into who's coming to who's house for what meal. It was pretty full on yesterday for lunch, but I decided against it, frankly I'm not sure why, and just logged out of the chat. Is it fear? The general depression that i've got going on? I don't know. Maybe it'd kickstart me into caring about things again.  

I'll sum up some of the positives. I was reasonably convinced as a medical student that I'd make a bad intern, because I couldn't take bloods well, I basically had never done a cannula, I never really put the effort in and basically taking a history was an umm and ahhh process and I was always scared someone would ask me a question. The bloods and cannulas turned out to be no problem, the history taking hasn't really come up but just general confidence will take care of that, as well as constant exposure to it and I know what to ask and whatnot. It's to do with my lack of motivation/rise in query depression over the last few months, I have nights on end free and refuse to even read the basic ALS/BLS stuff in the on call book. I don't even know where that little gem is. And my car is a disgrace, needs to be cleaned thoroughly, and I just can't be bothered. A cheeky second glass of red out of a box courtesy of mike is helping me put all this down and order it and structure some sort of mentality behind what the heck I've been doing in 2008. Truthfully, that's what it should boil down to. 2008 will forever be my intern year as a medical doctor. How will I remember it? Unchecked gambling addiction, drinking alone, sliding into depression and lethargy, not making any meaningful new friendships/relationships? As it stands, that's what the situation is. There's four months left of the year, I aim to fix these things. It's easy talk though - what are the plans for fixing it? Firstly, I need to just suck it up and get that treadmill I have the illusion of that'll open things up. I don't really doubt it though, the endorphins of post exercising is good enough to motivate me to do anything. Secondly, my intern approach needs to improve. I've been slack in terms of reading after hours, I've dissolved two saturday shifts, spent a saturday and a sunday fearful of being called in because both times I was drunk and hungover, and basically never gotten comfortable with a beeping pager on overtime. 

The overwhelming irony of this admirably lengthy bent paperclip is that it's now midnight on sunday night when I have to be starting my new rotation tomorrow morning where rounds will no doubt start at 7am. Basically I'm doing the kind of thing which is the crux of the issues I've raised as above. I'm happy to write it off though as an investment, because this kind of thing clears the head, gets the ideas out into a totally honest and frank summary, and that's not something I've done for a while. I never really did that with emma last year, but she was someone to talk to. She always seemed to have bigger issues than I did anyway, so maybe it kept me in check as to whether I had issues or not. Jack's been talking about travelling at the end of this month, which I'm keen to do but it will involve getting out of work on the saturday. I've done that twice now, and have in fact only been rostered on for two saturdays, so i'm at a pretty poor strike rate of attendance. By fortune I have two relief weekend days to my name which didn't require me. I'm on this sunday, which I'll do. It's a long weekend too, which is kind of annoying, but as if i was going to do anything worthy of anything anyway. Hopefully means all the teams will sort out their patients extra carefully for the long weekend and they'll be smooth sailing for the sunday. Doubt it. It'll be a good one to get in the bag though, since it'll be my first weekend day shift, and that's a hurdle I still need to jump. Also why I was so happy to have julian take my saturday shift yesterday. The RMO party would've been a bit less fun if I knew i had to work, but the relief i had when he took the shift was more to do with the fact i wouldn't have to work, rather than the fact i could drink heavily on the friday night. The only way to sort that out is to do these weekend shifts, which is just as well, since I seem to have five or six this term, out of the 11 weeks. Seems overly proportional based on the number of RMOs but them's the breaks. Also means I shouldn't have any guilt of getting out of that saturday shift that's holding up the travelling. 

Strangely therapeutic, writing all that, good job."

So I'm in Boulder, CO for a summer internship, and I've had a hard time finding out about electronic music in the area.  Everyone always said 'Denver is where you need to look buddy,' but I didn't know the first place to look.

Out of the blue one of my friends from back in Wisconsin who is living in the area tells me that Paul Oakenfold is playing at this place called Beta in Denver.  OH SHIT, a flash back to Sr. High School, and the '99 Essential Mix World Tour.  Late nights, Guild Wars, and Home @ Space in Ibiza... all these years and I've never seen the guy who initially fueled my love for trance music.

Long story short, this guy put on a hell of a show.  I heard a good mix of classics I listened to in high school and some of the newer stuff I hear on the podcasts.  I wasn't sure if he still did trance, but he most certainly does.  I had a huge smile for a lot of the show, so I'm sure people thought I was crazy or something.  I don't think I've been this happy since I saw Above &amp; Beyond for the first time.

Great night, great music, and I'm glad I could finally see and contribute a bit to the guy that helped me love this genre.

Have a good night/day r/trance.  Maybe I'll see some of you at EDC in Denver?  :D"
hrz3j,9,2011-06-05,It's been nearly two months... How do I move on?,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/hrz3j/its_been_nearly_two_months_how_do_i_move_on/,"Ok. I am 21 and my bf was 22, and we had been dating for nearly two years. He was my first real relationship, and he was also my brother's best friend, and our families are friends. It started out wonderful, but three months into our relationship, I went abroad for a year-long internship (which he had known about before we started dating). Before I left, he gave me a promise ring and told me he would wait for me, because ""I was worth waiting for."" The whole time abroad went fairly well as LDR's go; we texted often and had some contact on skype and facebook, and then 9 months into the internship, he came and visited me for 10 days. Everything was wonderful, and we were really serious and talked about marriage and spending our lives together. 

When I got back, I started college at a school only about 2 hours from where our families live. He was already working and had finished a degree from community college. Around Thanksgiving, we had started having issues with communication, and he started calling me ""needy"" because I wanted to talk to him more than he apparently liked. He decided to make rules, one of which was that we would only talk twice a week, and not more than an hour each time. I agreed, but wasn't happy. He stopped writing sweet messages on my facebook wall and we never skyped again. We saw each other about once or twice a month, and whenever we were together, we had a wonderful time and I would be satisfied that he still loved me. 

This spring everything got worse and he started doing things that really bothered me, seemingly on purpose. He told me he couldn't get off work to come visit me for Valentine's day (or at all during February or March), but then later went and spent 4 days with his high school friends at a different university (btw his friends are mostly girls). He kept doing things like this. When I would talk about school or my career goals, instead of being supportive, he made snide comments. Finally, I couldn't take the way he was ignoring me and treating me like less than a friend anymore and broke up with him, which was the hardest thing ever. At first, I felt really relieved. Two weeks later, he had a new girlfriend, which really hurt. Even though I knew it wasn't my fault, I couldn't stop blaming myself. 

Now it's been almost two months and although I think about him less, I still have days when I really miss him and think about him. There are still songs that make me cry when I hear them. Last night I dreamed about kissing him, which was really disturbing. I've never been through a break up before, and this was a really serious relationship. 

**TL;DR I had a really serious relationship for nearly two years that fell apart when I went to college. I broke up with him about two months ago but I still miss him a lot, even though he was a douchebag. What can I do to move on??**

P.S. Sorry this is so long."

She has no clue what to ask for!,Levirules3,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hrt9r/my_gf_needs_your_help_she_had_an_interview_for_an/,"OK.  So she is an interior design student.  She just had an interview for a paid internship in a custom cabinetry design office for kitchens and bathrooms.  The job will entail on-site measurements, designing floor plan layouts, customizing the cabinetry and finishes, etc.  She will need to learn new computer programs on the job to perform some of these tasks.

They asked her to come up with a desired salary for this position, but not only does she not know enough about the field yet to know how much to ask for, but she will be part time with fluctuating schedules.  Here are the points in bullet format to make it easier to take in:

* Everyone at this place is salaried
* She will be part time
* She will work more in the summer, perhaps 30 hrs/wk, for about three months
* She will work less during school, perhaps 10-15 hrs/wk, for about nine months
* It sounds like real work, not a BS ""go get coffee"" kind of internship
* It's in New York State, *not* NYC

** So, Reddit, how much should she ask for? **
I assume it would be best to come up with a dollar per hour amount and convert that to a salary based on the amount that she works.  OR vice versa, starting with a solid known salary for this kind of position, but full time, and tweaking it to account for the amount that she will be working there.

ht3ag,7,2011-06-06,Religious people technically suffer from delusions an important criteria when diagnosing schizophrenia according to the DSM-IV.,Cooky_Monstah,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/ht3ag/religious_people_technically_suffer_from/,"I've been reading the DSM-IV, *diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders*, to learn more about schizophrenia for an internship. After reading a section on the overall diagnosis of schizophrenia, it reminded me of our religious compatriots on earth. I can't find an online version of the DSM-IV that doesn't require a login, so here is an excerpt on schizophrenia. Everything in bold is my own statement, while everything in the normal text is what I've copied from the DSM-IV.

Delusions (Criterion A1) are erroneous beliefs that usually involve a misinterpretation of perceptions or experiences. Their content may include a variety of themes (e.g., persecutory, referential, somatic, religious, or grandiose). Persecutory delusions are most common; the person believes he or she is being tormented, followed, tricked **by the devil**, spied on **by an old dude with a beard**, or subjected to ridicule. Referential delusions are also common; the person believes that certain gestures **hands clasped**, comments **prayers**, passages from books **don't get us started**, newspapers, song lyrics, or other environmental cues are specifically directed at him or her. The distinction between a delusion and a strongly held idea is sometimes difficult to make and depends on the degree of conviction with which the belief is held despite clear contradictory evidence **This part was pure gold to read**. 
Although bizzare delusions are considered to be especially characteristic of Schizophrenia, ""bizarreness"" may be difficult to judge, especially across different cultures **this is sadly the only barrier to religious individuals not fully satisfying the delusion criteria for schizophrenia**. Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible and not understandable **(the holy trinity, seriously wtf is with it)** and do not derive from ordinary life experiences. An example of a bizarre delusion is a person's belief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and has replaced them with someone else's organs without leaving any wounds or scars **Washing away original sin with water comes to mind**. An example of a nonbizarre delusion is a person's false belief that he or she is under surveillance by the police. Delusions that express a loss of control over mind or body (i.e. those included among Schneider's list of ""first-rank symptoms"") are generally considered to be bizarre; these include a person's belief that his or her thoughts have been taken away by some outside force (""thought withdrawal""), that alien thoughts have been put into his or her mind (""thought insertion"") **Wow, look, the devil's influence**, or that his or her body or actions are being acted on or manipulated by some outside force (""delusions of control"") **speaking in tongues due to holy spirit for example**. If the delusions are judged to be bizarre, only this single symptom is needed to satisfy Criterion A for Schizophrenia.

**TLDR;** religious people have a significant symptom of delusion like those who suffer from schizophrenia.

**EDIT** Sorry, I had forgotten to change the title slightly. Religious individuals do not fully satisfy the criteria for having delusions because of the acceptance of religion in communities and their belief of the supernatural comes from poorly interpreted life experiences. Thanks, Kencabbit!"

hsyzw,0,2011-06-06,"Starting my own business, being middle man for new teachers going to China",Shuai,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/hsyzw/starting_my_own_business_being_middle_man_for_new/,"Hello everyone, I'm about to set up a company that will help new teachers getting to China and get work experience. I would like to hear any input you can come up with, and hear if anyone has tried something like this before.

The company will provide a ""Foreign Work Experience"" program (I guess like an internship but with a fancy name) for anyone whos interested in trying going to china and working in a foreign country. I'll train the teachers for a few weeks in Europe, help them with visa and airfare. My partner in China will set them up with apartment, chinese lessons and a job.

This will be kindergarten teaching ONLY, so the job would have way lower requirements than normal teaching. The people targeted for this would be young (im thinking 19+, although i started myself at 18), and generally without qualifications and eligibility for z-visa.

The business model is that during the first 6 months, the FWE program, the teacher is unpaid and is instead considered an intern/student. Our company will pay for housing, 1000 kuai food money per month, chinese lessons and reimburse visa and airfare at the end of the program. During the program we take the money the english company pays, but it will be less than it would pay for a normal teacher (because our teacher is new, so its like a ""trial"" period). so for instance in beijing where the average salary is 8-10000 per month, our company will take 36000 from the company for 6 months of fulltime teaching. Then once the company has decided if the teacher is good enough, and the teacher has gotten used to living in beijing and has gotten half a year of work experience and survival chinese in order, we will ""hand over"" the teacher to negotiate for a possible continuation of their contract with the company directly, and not interfere anymore after, unless they want us to.

the upside of the unpaid/intern part of the idea is that it'll be (more) legal for the teacher to be here on an F-visa, since he/she isnt getting paid, and we'll get the company that handles the chinese teaching to also handle the student visa. once trial period is over our company will not be involved if the teacher decides to continue working for a salary on an F visa (illegally) or, if he/she has the qualifications, wants to get a Z-visa and do it legally.

I personally used about 5 months, after i came to china on a tourist visa and started looking for jobs, before i finally got a job that i thought was good, and that ended up with me earning more than what id spent on travelling, living and visa. What our company wants to offer is cutting out the risk of going to china, in exchange for potentially less salary during the first semester. Even if you decide it sucks after 6 months, you will have had all expenses reimbursed and the only thing you'll have lost is time.

I have a lot of connections to english teaching ""broker"" companies in Beijing, and it's to them I want to ""sell"" the teachers at first. I realise this is gonna be a huge mess with 2 layers of middle men between the teacher and the school, but this way I know the jobs the teachers are going to do will not be shitty ones. Later I'd expand working directly with the schools, but ill wait with planning for that until later, once ive shown that this idea actually attacts both students and teachers.

I'd like to hear any input /r/china might have. :)

Unfunded mandates, contracts that are not up for negotiating, and state aid cuts make the equation really hard to balance.

This will keep getting worse every year. As class sizes get bigger something needs to fill the gap.  Volunteer-run chess clubs, internships with local businesses...?

It's essentially a partnership, though Sally makes an employee wage, no benefits, and gets minimal reimbursement for travel. She's been there for over a year, and has helped the business grow substantially, though because she has no ownership stake, and the owner's name is publicly associated with the company, most new clients come seeking the owner and not Sally.

Thus, the company's reputation is at least half due to my sister's work, though to see how much she's being paid, you'd think she was an intern. 

   At first, Sally was ok with this. She was ecstatic to get a job in her chosen field at all after the economy tanked, especially at a small operation that puts a premium on niche creativity over generic mass appeal. The owner has long been dropping regular hints and words of encouragement, as though Sally's patience with the business' fledgling start would pay big returns. Sally was happy to make the sacrifices in the beginning, but as yet, she's received almost no increase in compensation in any way, shape, or form.

The owner is not intentionally unfair or exploitative, but absent-minded and maybe a little inconsiderate. Outside of the compensation issue, she's warm and kind to my sister, and regularly invites her to personal get-togethers.

   Sally's dilemma is this: How should she go about approaching the compensation issue? What's fair for her to ask for in a small operation like this? How should she respond to the owner's resistance to a raise/benefits, given the close nature of their working relationship? Sally is an artist first, a business person second (third or fourth, really), so negotiating acumen is not her strong suit, and is all the more uneasy about the situation since the boss is also a co-worker and friend.

The area I live in, Central New Jersey (USA), is fairly pedestrian friendly.  There are lots of sidewalks/crosswalks.  However, New Jersey definitely has an over abundance of asshole drivers.

I did a mini test run today (rode about halfway there) and it seems ok.  I did run into a creeper, but I just crossed to the other side of the street.  I'm not so much worried about the time it takes to get there.  I'll just leave an hour early for work.

Positives of doing this:

-Save money on gas
-Get/stay in shape.  I love to run, however I work two jobs and I'm doing an internship, so that doesn't leave as much time to run and jog as much as I would like.  So riding my bike would be a nice way to exercise
-I would get to enjoy the nice summer weather
-Riding a bike is just a lot of fun

Negatives:
-Asshole NJ drivers
-May be a bit dangerous in the areas with heavier traffic
-I would have to adjust my schedule accordingly.
-Creepers

So does anyone else ride their bikes to work?  Do you enjoy it and is it something you would recommend?"

Conversely, I'd love to just talk/impart some friendly advice to anyone out there as well.

I am certainly one of you, an avid smoker, a connoisseur of chronic, a buddy of bud, a welcomer of weed. This is my first ever true post on trees and I would like to just ask for your inebriated prayers. I've recently applied to an internship a prestigious (Public) Emergency Medical Hospital working as a volunteer as well as engaging in a research project. This position is certainly an amazing stepping stone for my future as a medical professional. I am hoping to apply to medical school in a couple of years and to work towards becoming a surgeon. This internship would mark a great moment of my life, and I pursued diligently with the application, the recommendations, the interview, and eventually the maintaining of my grades.

I was accepted...

It has been the start of my orientation week and one of the preliminary tests were a urine sample, and a blood sample. Little did I know that these tests were to look for illicit drugs... Marijuana included. Knowing this I panicked, looking for one of the coordinators to anonymously ask, ""Should the test come positive, what would be the outcome?"". Apparently if the tests were positive, I would be dismissed from the internship.

Several things that I have not mentioned: About 3 weeks ago I had to discontinue the herbal essence as I needed to focus on my finals, however, I do not know if this is enough for me to be able to pass the drug test. They performed a urine analysis as well as a blood test, and I fear that I quite honestly may not be able to pass this obstacle.

Fellow ents, I am a hard working student, I aspire to be one of the most honorable of professionals, and I am a loving son, brother, as well as boyfriend. What I ask, is that you keep me and my endeavors in your thoughts, as I await the results of my drug test. All I really ask is for any legitimate information as to whether I am in the clear.

Sincerely,

We hoped that it would translate into an offer, but there weren't any openings...

So she spent the last few months applying to a ton of jobs with contractors that support agencies like the FBI, CIA, and DHS (as well as jobs at the agencies themselves).

She hasn't even gotten an interview for things she is over-qualified for, and she is pretty discouraged.  She's one of those straight-A, hard working kind of people, so we thought she would have been able to find something by now.

I went to Univ. of Maryland and failed out and then I came home to go to community college and ultimately graduated college with a Bachelor's Degree (BA) in Accounting with a 2.8 GPA.  It took me almost 10 years to graduate college, although I did skip semesters here and there.  All the while, I was working as a bartender in various restaurants to be able to live comfortably, and pay rent, car payments, car insurance, etc.
While in school I read an article regarding adult ADHD, which almost described my personality exactly and decided to see a shrink for it.  I was prescribed ritalin and immediately saw an improvement in my note taking abilities and retention and I used it until I graduated.

When I graduated, I had a very difficult time finding work.  Most jobs I applied to were looking for someone with office experience or internships of which I had zero on my resume.  Finally, I was able to get an internship at a non-profit in accounts payable which ultimately landed me a job in a family owned real estate business earning 40K with benefits as a property manager.  Unfortunately, the boss in the business was a shady person and asked me if I could cook his books so he could jack up rents in renovated apartments in a recently purchased building (he kicked the previous tenants out after purchase).  While I was property manager, I continued to work as a bartender on the weekends and worked 6 days/week for the better part of a year.  
When the boss asked me to commit fraud, I quit the property management job.  I still had my bartending job and I really wanted to spend the winter skiing.  Since I had some extra funds, I picked up a goPro.  I loved editing the [movies](http://www.youtube.com/supertreegeek) I made with my goPro. I had asperations of becoming a film editor, but I wasn't interested in going back to school so I kept the filmmaking to a hobby.  

Now, I've picked up homebrewing, and I know I can make good beer ( my friends love it) and I'm torn because I have a good idea for a brewery, but my local area is lacking a homebrew supply store and I know the perfect location, which I want to turn into a homebrew supply store/brew your own beer store (a place where people can brew beer without having to make a mess in their homes).  The problem is, I do not have much capital.  I know I can make this dream happen!   

I was explaining my situation to my girlfriend the other day and I need to get a second job, because while bartending is paying the bills, I'm living paycheck to paycheck, I need to start saving more money.  

Here's my dilemma:
I'm the type of person that learns by doing more than anything else.  I learned to become a bartender by watching other bartenders and making drinks.  I am a great bartender and I usually make between $1000-$1500/week bartending (I only work friday, saturday and sunday).  But I am good at my job because I have a solid work ethic and I genuinely like to make people happy (and get them drunk).  
I know it seems that bartending is the only thing I know, but it is not.  I have ~1 year of office experience and I am well-versed in Word and Excel (I can create all sorts of spreadsheets, I know many of the formulas, etc.).  I am also good with photoshop, illustrator, imovie and I can learn most computer programs rather quickly.  
I am also mechanically inclined.  I love to work with my hands and build and take apart items, and tinker with them.  I fixed the dryer in our house by cannibalizing parts from another dryer.  I had no manual, nor did I look online for instructions.  I just figured it out. 

**How can I convey my ability to learn-by-doing and good work ethic to prospective employers without them dismissing me (and my cover letter and resume) immediately because of my lack of experience?**

TL;DR: I'm all over the place, and I don't know how to get myself grounded somewhere.

htr0c,1,2011-06-07,Really feeling like there's no way out right now...,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htr0c/really_feeling_like_theres_no_way_out_right_now/,"This is probably going to end up being a bit lengthy, so bear with me.

So back in March I moved out of my previous housing and into a house with some friends, thinking my cost of living would go down.  I went from living with one other person paying $350 a month to living with four others, paying closer to $400 a month.  This happened because the house they were living in is built so horribly that, to keep our house around 60 degress F our gas bill was around $300 a month.  So add that onto a $240 rent, and other bills and I was paying through the ass for this place.  So while I was living there March and April, I chose to pay bills and buy food instead of rent because I wasn't on the lease and they weren't being forced to pay it at the time.  Also, since January I only go out with my friends once a week and I barely spend anything, so it's not like all my money is going to a bar.  I was thinking of moving back home with my parent's, but I don't really know if I can A) Ditch my friends like that or B) because my dad turned my bedroom into his office and my sister's old room I don't think would do.  Also, my girlfriend and I would really have nowhere to go because she's stuck at her dad's place until she finds a job (just graduated; job search going bad).  We're barely see each other as is and with that arrangement it'd be non-existent.  

On top of the $960.00 I need for rent until I move out in August, my allergies are making it extremely hard to work my two jobs.  They're so severe that I've been reprimanded and work for blowing my nose and putting in eye drops so often.  I don't do it for pleasure or to get out of working - it's necessary (I work at a presitigious burger joint in the area as a server).  I want to get to the doctor, but I work so damn often and just can't afford it right now.  I have one day off a week and I normally spend it with the girlfriend.  To spend that time at the doctor would mean even less time with her.  I'm getting little to no sleep due to allergies also.  Last night I got home from Job A at 1.00am and had to be up at 6.00am to make it to Job B by 7.00am.  I fell asleep at 1.30am, awoke at 2.00am, and didn't fall asleep again until 5.15-5.30 am.  I woke up at 6.00am, and have felt like absolute SHIT so far not to mention, on top of working Job B until 3.30pm today I work Job A again from 5.00 until 10.00 tonight.

What I'm getting at is that I've never felt so low.  I feel like every time I climb a little higher out of this hole, I slip and fall further into it.  I need to get to the doctor, but what needs to be done to control this allergies isn't going to be cheap.  I'm already late for this month's rent so I can't really spend too much at the doctor's getting shots (in the past we've tried every medication to no avail).  For the past month I've only been able to eat one meal a day that consists of either ramen noodles or one footlong at Subway (6 inch for lunch and 6inch for dinner).  Also, I go out once a week with my girlfriend's friends (it lets me relax only a little and she used to work at the bar we go to so we get cheap, if not free, drinks.  Most I've spent there is $15 and that was after about five hours of drinking).  I haven't had the money for rent so I'm trying to spend as little as possible until i have that covered.  Once that's covered I'm hoping to go shopping so I have grocieries (if bills aren't a shit ton).

On top of working around 50 hours a week, getting no sleep, and barely eating, I need to be studying to take my CCENT and CCNA tests this summer so I can possibly get a job/internship to supplement classes and another job for this fall.  I barely get to study because I'm always too fatigued to focus.  I don't want to do the server job during the school year because it'd be way too much on top of school and the extra curriculars I participate in.  I'd rather it be an internship and my office job, but chances are I'll end up serving because there are no internships available around my area.

I know there are people worse off than me, but I don't know what I'm going to do.  I was hoping to save a bit of money to get a more fuel efficient car to save money on gas, but I don't see that happening.  I was hoping to take a small trip with the girlfriend at the end of summer, but don't see that happening.  I was thinking of selling some stuff to help put a dent in what I owe/will owe, but the only things I have of value are my PS3 and computer.  The computer can't go because I need it for school (I'm a CIS/Networking Major) and the PS3 can't go because it's the only form of entertainment I have.  I don't play games, I just watch movies on my parent's Netflix (I actually don't have any games).  The only things I could sell are a broken XBox 360 I have, old laptop parts from a Dell Inspiron, or my old fish tank.  I think altogether that would net me like, $120 (on the high end).  I think I'm going to try throwing that stuff on eBay this weekend.

I don't really expect help, honestly I don't.  I just needed to vent.  I tried talking to my dad this morning, but he just sweeps everything away and offers no real advice.  My mom is about the same - no words of wisdom, just sweepage.  I try to stay positive for the girlfriend also because she's under a bit of stress as well with finishing her capstone and spending hours a day job searching and resume sending.  It's getting extremely difficult to keep this charade of positivity going for her sake, but I don't want to freak her out.   


tl;dr - Deep in a hole and can't get out - pun not intended."
htqat,2,2011-06-07,Interesting item in the desk of my boss,poodlenoodle14,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htqat/interesting_item_in_the_desk_of_my_boss/,"Here is the story: I am a 21 year old female summer intern. My direct boss is a very nice older man. Everyone loves him, he is the kind of guy who would do anything for you and never expect a favor in return. He is VERY old. Sometimes he makes jokes that seem a little inappropriate, or says things that are kind of strange, but I am never alone with him, so for the most part I just ignore it because I don't think he means any harm. Anyway, he has this drawer in his desk where he keeps little mints and random candy, post it notes, etc and he has always told me to help myself. Recently, upon retrieving such an item from the drawer I found something kind of concerning. My boss had a condomn sitting in the drawer directly next to all the items I am allowed to be taking from said drawer. Here are my questions to you: 1. Why on earth would my 70+ year old boss need a condomn? 2.Why did he leave it somewhere he knows I regularly look? 3.Should I be concerned by this?  Most of my friends think its hilarious, but I though I would ask you guys."

htja7,1,2011-06-07,"My lil bro is a wow-addict, meth abuser, theif, failing student and cutter.",airchair-kid,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htja7/my_lil_bro_is_a_wowaddict_meth_abuser_theif/,"I want my brother to stop cutting, stop stealing, stop doing drugs, to play in moderation, and to go to college / vo-tech.

My brother is failing highschool, does drugs during school. He also plays wow all day and steals when he is unable to play. If he cannot play, he will cut himself, threaten to kill his family, strike his parents, damage household items, and then run away from home or get arrested. He hates his family (me, mom, dad)

I'm the exact opposite. attending a top ivy, interned at great companies, and for the most part, on my way to a stable life. I'm never home and currently on the sidelines, but I really want to do something about this, since I know he'll end up on the streets if I don't do something. I would give up the internships I slaved away years for, my girlfriend I've been dating several years, and even drop out of college!

My parents won't be able to help much. they are both disabled - one mentally, the other one physically. Thus my family is very poor.



I believe WoW is central to the problem, although not the only problem. However, I feel getting him over WoW would be a significant step up and can build momentum to attack other things (confidence, schooling). The main reason being that he last said he hated me for blocking WoW and returned to drugs because of that. He also mentioned how happy he was, and how he didn't need drugs for the times he did play. He might just be trying to guilt me though - his words are hard to trust, except i actually believe this.


I know for a fact bribing him with rewards doesn't work with anyone with such a huge lifestyle change. He refuses to do anything except play/eat/hang out with friends/shower/listen to music/spend hours dressing up and ruining my work clothes (ugh). So here are some ideas I've come up with. extremely rough.



Play with him a little and build relationship with him so I have stronger influence over his decisions. Do other activities he likes with him. This may be the only way to communicate with him without being in a heated situation.

Let him play, but ask him to play at home instead of running away. He can invite friends over. Will use a lot of positive reinforcement when he doesn't play.

Let him play, but force him to play when he doesn't want to. Maybe he'll get sick of playing this way eventually.

Travel with him. Try to accomplish a goal we have in common to build a relationship with him. The travel can also give him new hobbies.

Get a pet dog in the house, to at least get him off the game. He'll have to take care of the dog. eventually get him to run with the dog etc.

This one is crazy lol. Get hot girls to talk to him and encourage him to do other things. Use hotgirls to reinforce when he does more positive things with his life. crazy I know... but sex is one of the most basic drives. This will probably hurt him and make things even worse though.


Anyone have any tips?"
htiz4,3,2011-06-07,Intentionally ambiguous working hours are killing me. Suggestions for how to get a more regular schedule?,badboss69,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htiz4/intentionally_ambiguous_working_hours_are_killing/,"Hi Reddit--
I'm an engineer at a relatively small software company. I work very hard (read: NO reddit at work) and often don't take lunch breaks so I can continue working. I like to think I have a steady output of code that is of at least medium quality. 

Anyhow, when I started the job, the boss said something like ""come in whenever you like, but generally around 9 or so""--standard cs job protocol. Because I take the train to work, and I am at the mercy of its schedule, for me this initially meant coming in at 9:30. For a while, I was an intern, and because the boss explicitly said ""we can't afford to pay you overtime"", as often as I could be, I was out of the office by 5:30 flat. 

I recently transitioned into being a full employee, and got a small raise to signify this. Because I was used to it, I continued to arrive at work around 9:30, but started to leave later, generally around 6:30. Many days, I would be there before my coworkers, but either way, I always left after them. Also, because I still didn't take lunch breaks, and my coworkers took at least an hour, I continued to actually work 1-2 more hours per day than my coworkers. 

Well one day, the assing train got held up for 45 minutes, and I was late to a supposedly important meeting. Boss was super pissed, gave me a massive tongue lashing, etc. etc. At the end of his rant, he mentioned ""you always come in late anyhow, the least you could do would be to arrive earlier!"" 

I sent him a pointed email that night assuring him that I would now be arriving at work at 8:30 every day from now on, and not leaving until at least 6. I informed him that I didn't realize the hours were a problem...Well, this resulted in an awkward meeting the next day in which he said he wished we could all be ""Flexible"" with hour hours. He assured me ""I've got friends who don't leave work until midnight, you're really got it made here!"", etc. etc. 

The thing is, after this meeting, I've really come to realize what he means by ""flexible"". He has become tyrannical in his enforcement of hours. Though I now arrive at 8:30 every day (mind you, he often gets in at 11, and ""works from home"" 1-2 days a week), I now find that I am completely unable to leave before he does without an excuse. And because he gets in at 11, he tends to work much later. I have had to resort to inventing scenarios whereby I ""have to"" leave in the evenings--when i'm leaving at 7:30 after having been at work for 11 hours straight.  As if needing to stop working because I have been doing it for 11 hours already, and more importantly, needing to EAT, are not ""excuses"" enough to leave. 

My boss has the train schedule posted above his desk, and here is his worst, most psychological trick: He knows which train I have been taking home, and if I leave at any other time than when I usually do, he will ask ""which train are you taking again?"" in the most probing, insincere, ""how dare you leave my workplace after only working 10.5 hours"" kind of way. Most of the time, I am leaving at this other time because I am taking the train in the opposite direction (to see my brother for dinner, for instance), and it has a different schedule.

But the supreme consequence of all of this is that I feel completely trapped at work. I must either wait until the boss leaves, which can be a while because he arrives at work 1.5 hours later than I do, or I must be prepared to ""Explain"" why I am heading out. 

I've found myself working from 8:30 until 7:30, without a lunch break, almost every day since this ""incident"". It is draining me in every possible way. 

A further complication is that it actually may be illegal for me to be working these hours. Though I am a salaried employee, my salary is below the cutoff for overtime pay exemption. This is a whole different matter, but something I often wonder about...

And one final issue, I do have a coworker, who is for some reason unnecessarily competitive. I have been working these hours not by choice, but out of a feeling of desperation...but he takes all of this as a sign of competitiveness, and he has taken to trying to ""beat"" my hours by coming in earlier and leaving later. He hates it too, I know it, but he has dramatically misunderstood the situation. Interestingly, I have the feeling that my boss wishes to encourage this ""competition"" (which I honestly would like to have no part whatsoever in), because it means his worker bees work more and he reaps the benefits...

Tomorrow I am meeting for my 9 month review, and I desperately want to tell my boss how much I despise my 11 hour days...the intentionally ambiguous hours-setting that leaves me overworked and under-motivated...the unnecessary scrutiny I receive for simply wishing to go home at the end of the day and eat dinner...the inherent hypocrisy of my boss, who works *at least* 15 fewer hours per week than I do, enforcing such stringent regulations.

But I have no idea how to approach the issue. After the last meeting, I am scared to say anything at all. If I do, I am positive that his response will once again be that I should remain ""flexible"". I hate this word more than any he has ever said. I hate this idea that work hours can be ""flexible"", that my boss can have maximal power over my time and my life.

I'm sorry this is so long, I am just rambling on over the internet because I have no idea what else I can do at this point. If anyone has any advice, or has been in such a ""flexible"" situation before, please let me know what you have done to keep things manageable. 

INB4 ""quit ur job lol"", I get this all the time but it really isn't practical. It is hard enough to find a job these days, you've got to take what you can get...

TL;DR: jerky boss won't let me leave in the evenings, expects 11 hour days but only works 4 days a week himself..."

A down to earth view from a downtrodden college student.,Newtonsenigma,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hti1x/the_whole_thing_sucks_a_down_to_earth_view_from_a/,"So this is my dilemma. I'm a 25 y/o college student my major is in physics and there seems to be no end to the hoops I have to go through just to be enrolled. I am a white male so I don't get as many breaks when it comes to funding. Financial Aid is monitoring my grades for 2 semesters this is the last week of the 2nd semester and it's finals week so a lot rests on my shoulders to get better than 'c's. At the beginning of the semester there was a glitch in the system and I was put up for academic dismissal even though I got straight 'A's. That got ironed out and I was able to continue my education.

That's just the beginning of my troubles. I don't have a job, car, place of my own. Currently I'm staying with my mom but things are getting a little dicey. I still love my mom but I need to get out. The job market in my area is little to none, I get bitched at for not having a job. My mom still thinks that you can just walk up to a business and get hired. It's not the 80's anymore. I've tried to calmly explain why the job market is lousy, but according to ""Fox New's"" every word that comes out of my mouth is liberal.

To be honest I really need a job. I put my search on hold during this last semester. I had a very full course load. I was/am taking AC theory, Tech Math II (there was no pre-reqs but it's equivalent would be trigonometry with basic calculus. I took Tech Math I last semester which I would liken to College Algebra. Other than that I haven't taken a math class since I was in High School), Real Estate Economics, and a survey of rock and roll class.

I have multiple skills, I've worked at a lot of different places and have accrued a lot of different skills. Everything from customer service to defusing altercations. So why is it so hard for a white male in his mid-20's to get a job? If I can't find one soon I'll be living out of my backpack. It's nothing new to me, 2 years ago I was homeless and living on the streets in Anchorage and then Seattle for close to year. To be honest it wasn't the proudest time of my life, there are things I've done and never wish to do again; but, if put back in a survival situation I would do it all over.

I have 2 more years of 12+ units to be able to transfer to Cal-Poly. What good is that? It's not like it's everyday somebody has aspirations to be a physicist. Math and science have always come easy to me and I enjoy figuring out puzzles. What better puzzle to solve than our universe. Who else is going to rebuild the world or find us a new one when SHTF? The main areas I want to focus in are Nanotechnology and Artificial Life Programming. Not your everyday goals. This isn't some random idea that I had. I had to think about it for a long time. I've come to the realization that I am going to spend the next 10-12 years taking classes and attending symposiums before I am done with school. It doesn't end there; I hope to be learning something new for the rest of my life.

In closing, I would like to know if there is any way I can get an internship that would pay me and help me continue to go to school? Like I said there isn't much left for me where I'm at, and I am willing to work for what I want.

TLDR: I'm going to college to be a physicist and the man keeps putting me down.
I need a job but there are none to be had. I bet if I was Mexican..."

I did suggest working from home to my boss but was denied due to company policy or maybe he's afraid of me setting a precedence for future interns. I can also be ultra productive coding at coffee chains like Starbucks.

Is there something wrong with me? I'm beginning to dread going to work and cannot ever see myself working in individual cubicles which is pretty common for offices where I live. Do I have a disorder or phobia I do not know of? Everyone around me seems to have no problem with this style. Is it just me?! I'm going crazy. Help!

We sit next to each other for 8 hours a day and have really been hitting it off. We almost don't get our work done because we spend all day talking. It's turned kind of mutually flirtatious and last weekend she kind of implied that she wanted me to ask her out. I am quite certain that I am not misreading her here.


I'm conflicted here, I'm really crushing on this girl but I could see complications having to work right next to each other if it doesn't work out. 


We do go to the same school (although didn't know each other before this) so I could wait until we're close to the end of our 8 months internship, but that feels really long.


Is it worth the risk of an uncomfortable working situation?"
hv1ee,5,2011-06-08,Mice got me down...,backseatredditor,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/hv1ee/mice_got_me_down/,"I recently started at my first lab minion position on campus, in a neuroscience lab.  I'm being trained to do a few different tasks, including mouse ""surgery"", in which I take a mouse's brain and prepare it for experiments/data recording.  I've already rationalized it, mentally, and I'm on board with the objective, and the value of animal models to science.  
But I didn't see this coming.  Granted, I'm new at this, but the few ""surgeries"" I've performed were kind of really upsetting.  Part of it might be my lack of finesse (newbie-ness), so I'm tempted to keep an open mind and see if I get better at it and ""get over it"".  But I also don't want to waste anyone's time.  It's not even the blood and guts, it's just handling the animal, particularly while it's still awake/alive that I find stressful.
I had a very hard time finding even this lab internship for the summer, so I'm reluctant to give it up, and I know how important lab experience is for grad school applications, even though I think I'd rather not work with animal models for a living.  I have previous professional experience in a lab setting where I was a technician/assistant researcher, but it was physical science/engineering.  
Anyway, is it worth it?  It's not a paid minion-ship, but it was the only lab-type thing I could secure for the summer.  Is it normal to freak out like this at first when one has to hack up animals, and does it get easier or am I just not cut out for this and should quit &amp; save everyone time?  (They want me to continue into the fall/spring too, which will be my last year as an undergrad this time).  
And is the sort of thing that, ya know, doesn't bode well for my career as a biologist?  Is it mice all the way down, or could I still do just fine as a microbiologist, for example?"

My career track is not that bad thusfar at all, in my opinion, but it has not been the traditional industry track that most people have. There is a lot of gov and hydrology/water/environmental work that I have done. Not a lot of ""actual"" chemical engineering.

I am thinking about going into Public Policy (they have Engineering Public Policy degrees at a few colleges) or ChemE for grad school when I return in 2014. I could also apply for chemical engineering jobs when I return to gain some more practical experience. I will be 25 however, and would like to start grad school earlier rather than later. 

Any one want to offer their engineering opinion? Would this be a sufficient career base for more graduate school, or should I get more experience? I am really interested in a [program like this](http://mepp.umd.edu/) or [this](http://www.epp.cmu.edu/) - does it seem legit?"

You all deal more with c++, ruby and the like, but I figure you guys could point me in the right direction for my project.


I started an internship doing some consulting and I have started to realize just how sloppy their system is right now. Basically we are trying to convert two huge data files into 4 summary graphs. Right now they have got this process spread out over a bunch of different excel files and a lot of copying and pasting. I am trying to make this a much more linear system all within one excel file. To help automate this process it would really help if I was able to parse through a word file and grab some specific numbers. The word file looks a little like this:


Header text:
*Store number* blah blah blah PLU **12314** blah blah blah PLU **2515**


*Store number* blah bluh blue orange PLU **3134**


and so on.


My dream is to be able to parse through the word file and grab all the PLU numbers and then put them into an excel column, it'd be cool to also grab the store numbers associated with them but thats a little more advanced and not totally necessary. Do you guys know anyway to do this? They always follow the word PLU but they're of different lengths. Let me know if you guys have any ideas.

hunxi,3,2011-06-08,"Reddit, around $15,000+/- was stolen from my mothers house..what else do we need to do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hunxi/reddit_around_15000_was_stolen_from_my_mothers/,"I'm just a lurker but the time has come and I may need some advice.

First I would like to apologize if this ends up being rather long, but I would like to cover as much info as I can.  Also I am sorry for any typos or confusion, my mind has been racing since this happened and I am furious.  I am sure I missed some parts of the story as all of this has been very frustrating.

**Background info:**  My mothers house was robbed on Saturday 6/4, did not find out until Monday 6/6.  Police were notified and are conducting a investigation.

**The Incident:**  My entire family was at a wedding reception (6/4) and sometime between 4:30pm and 8:30pm our house was robbed.  The worst part of it is it was my cousin, a drug addict (heroin and crack).  She has not been around the family for ~1 year and while everyone was away at the reception she had two friends drive her to the house.  I had spoken with one of the individuals who was in the vehicle with her and his side of the story was that my cousin asked for a ride to her fathers house to get money from an insurance claim from her vehicle that was stolen and wrecked (drug deal related).  He claims that they dropped her off on the side of the road up past our house (we live in the country).  After she was done doing gathering up the valuables she called one of the two individuals in the vehicle and said to come back down the road and that she was ready. They picked her up in front of the house and he said she came out with two large bags and two shoe boxes.  He claims he did not know what was in them and that he wasn't involved (obviously doesn't want in trouble). After that he claims they gave her a ride into town, which is where she pawned off roughly 6k worth of my mothers jewelery.

Fast forward to Monday.  My mother could not find her laptop and thought she misplaced it (she is very forgetful).  I am away during the week doing my internship and I was on the phone with her, I mentioned that I could not find the shoebox which contained my xbox 360 (I recently moved back from college and a majority of my belongings were still in boxes in one of our rooms).  I suspected that something was fishy and that it was a good idea to go double check a few places for the laptop and xbox.  She had called me back later, already in tears, as she realized we had been robbed.  She  checked places where she had valuable items hidden (jewelry) and that was the giveaway.  Police were notified, came out and took our information and tried gathering some prints which came up with nothing.  We had suspected it was my cousin, as she has been on drugs for the past year and isn't welcome around the family for numerous reasons (several minor thefts of many family members) and that the time of the reception would have been an excellent window for her to commit the crime.  The police said they would work with what information they had.  Supposedly they check pawn stores/jewelry shops for events like this, however they only do it once a month, which of course everything would be gone by then.  Soon as the cop leaves my mom rushes into town to check some shops.  The second jewelry store she went had a majority of jewelry, therefore my mother had called the cops.  This was a huge sigh of relief, as they keep records of everyone they buy from and had a copy of her identification, as well as pictures of all the jewelry she sold to them. By this time the mall was already closing and we would have to wait until the following day to do anything else.

The next day a police officer went to the mall and acquired the jewelry.  My mother and I went around to several other places looking for more jewelry as well as the laptops and xbox, which came up with nothing.  After some personal investigation and several phone calls later, we found out she had been staying at a hotel for the previous two days where she was smoking crack with some other people.  By the time the police had arrived they had already checked out, the room was in her ex-boyfriends name.

Later in the evening, my mother went back to the mall to look for my items, she had found some watches at one of the jewelry stores, but the owner was rather rude, he already yelled at my mom for calling the cops and said she should have left them out of it.  He told her if she paid $1600 he would have gave her everything back. She called the police again, but they would not send anyone out because the officer dealing with the case was off-duty.

A second jewelry store, which the female driver of the vehicle just so happens to work at, may have had some items as well, that the female had sold to the store herself (it was in their books). It was dated prior to the incident, however I suspect she wrote a prior date to save her ass.  The story was that she came in with her father to sell the jewelry, however my uncle is really good friends with her father and had talked to him and he said that she was lying and he was never with her. She barely stays at home and her dad said he knows she does drugs already.  The owner was also rather rude to my mother and said there is nothing she can do, as he already shipped the jewelry away to be melted.

This is where I am looking for any advice, it has been a stressful last two days, and I think we handled everything properly although you never know.  We already contacted our home owners insurance and opened a claim.  We are still busy trying to identify which items are missing and making a detailed list for both the police and insurance company.  We are not worried about the remaining items as insurance will cover it, however what we want to make sure is done is justice to be served.  There has been a huge drug problem in the county for years now (Indiana, Pennsylvania).  It seems every time an arrest is made, charges never stick and people are let go or given very minor charges.  I wouldn't be surprised if the other two individuals who gave her a ride are not charged with anything.  Supposedly the one girl, who owned the vehicle already spoke with the police earlier this morning and said she did not know the items that my cousin came out with were stolen. I had personally spoke with the other individual that was along for the ride in the car and he said he knew it was suspicious but didn't want to know what was in the bag or whom it belonged to, however he does know our house so I am sure it was just a line of bull as he does not want to get in trouble.  He also has a history of crimes and drug use.  Is there anyway they can charge the individuals in the vehicle with any type of crime, such as being an accomplice even though they claim they had nothing to do with it? I mean they gave her a ride for a insurance check, yet she came back with 15,000 worth of stolen items.  

**TL;DR** Mothers house was robbed by drug addict cousin (roughly 15k worth of items) It seems like very little is being done, and we wouldn't have even recovered the items we did or gained information if it wasnt for our own personal investigation, which we relayed all information to the police."

Advice?,mikenike192,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/humex/thinking_of_switching_from_ps3_to_pc_gaming_for/,"I've been playing ps3 since its release back in 2006 and I had a ps2 before that.I love shooter games on ps3, I'm a big fan of using a controller with COD. I have a couple games on PC (L4D 2 and Portal 2) that I think are fantastic and really enjoy. However the pc style of controls mouse/keyboard are still challenging for me though I am getting better. Before playing these games this year I hadn't really played any shooters on PC since the days of Metal of Honor Allied Assault and Rainbow Six. I feel superior playing shooters on the ps3 because I am very fluent with the controller and everybody likes doing well in matches.

I imagine myself still playing a lot of games on the ps3 in the future like FIFA as well as 3rd person games like Assassins Creed as I feel dual analog sticks are superior for navigating a 3d world. 

But with games coming out this fall like Battlefield 3 and Elder Scrolls V, I am thinking about switching to PC because the experience I feel will be superior. I have Battlefield 2 for PS2 and loved it and Elder Scrolls IV for PS3 and also loved that. But for these games I feel they are better suited for playing on a PC as the graphics and gameplay will be better with a mouse and keyboard.

I have a macbook pro 2.8ghz core 2 duo 4gb ram and discrete graphics card which I play games on right now and its okay, no where near stellar in terms of performance as the OSX implementation of steam and the half life engine is not of the same quality as the Win 7 version. I've always wanted to build a pc as I think it'll be a very rewarding experience and being a CS major I like tinkering. 

I like the idea of consoles as every game will run perfectly smooth and there is no need to worry about whether it'll run a new game. However  PC's have the capabilities of having better graphics than a PS3. What should I be looking to spend on a custom machine that will run BF3 and Elder Scrolls V smoothly at 1920x1200 which is what my monitor is. How long do pc components stay relevant, how long before you typically need to upgrade your system? Should I go all out with something like an i7 to future proof myself or is that unnecessary? I am also interested in being able to add OSX to the machine (hackintosh) as I really like Xcode and if I have a pc that is more powerful that my MBP why not use that to develop on, though at my internship this summer I'm using Visual Studio which is also a phenomenal IDE as I am working with VB net.

First things first - I'm 22 male and also a huge HUUUUGEEE liar. That's where all my problems came from. I do lie because I'm afraid of negative response from friends/relatives/etc. I used to make up all kinds of excuses not to go somewhere or not to do something. But people who invited always asked something like ""why so? what your are doing?"". So for me  this negative response(now I usually say ""Fuck yeah, let's do this shit!"" and end up doing things I never really wanted to). Also, if I have to do something(but for some reason don't) I usual lie what everything went fine and I did as I was expected(like passed exam and so on). So where do I find myself now? In a dead end. You see, I dropped out from uni at my last year. Never told my parents. Had a ""Master Plan"" how to get back on tracks but never implemented it. Parents think that I will graduate this month. They also think that tomorrow I will go out to uni to defend my last paper work(or how do you call it). This is my dead end. I lied them straight in their eyes about how everything is fine. My whole family and close relatives think that I'm nailing my uni. I dropped out like 3 months before we had to do internship.  So, to make my parents believe that I still go to uni(and later do have internship) I usually took 3 hours walk every day or was driving around using public transportation. Most of that was done during deep winter. Those 6 months I did absolutely nothing. 
My plan is to roll out of 9-story building. I'm very afraid that I will land butt/legs first. Wanted to do it today but freaked out and also got lazy. Tomorrow I will have to do it. I should say that I don't really want to commit suicide, it's just what I have to do( you don't want to go to school/work but you have to. Same with me).

I'm really looking forward to that, I've been to Kazakhstan before and although Astana wasn't my favourite city I love Kazakhstan and the Kazakh people so I really want to go there! I was wondering if someone who currently lives in Astana has any advice on what to do in my free time and how I could mix in with the local people? Especially in the evenings, I figured I could always visit some other cities and villages during weekends (Pavlodar, Korgalzhyn, Kokshetau). Is there any volunteer work I could do for example? Are there sport clubs I could join? Youth/Student organizations? (I'm 22) My Russian is terrible, but there is no better way to learn it than to talk with locals so I would love to join a local organization, maybe I can even pick up some Kazakh :) I'm very interested in nature/the environment, photography and Central Asia/traveling of course :)

Any advice is welcome, thanks!"
huhjr,5,2011-06-08,How do I go about in the professional world (about to graduate from film program),IamCastorTroy,WeAreTheFilmMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheFilmMakers/comments/huhjr/how_do_i_go_about_in_the_professional_world_about/,"So, as the title suggests, I'm about to graduate from college with a degree in film. My ideal job would be in cinematography (a long shot, I know) although I'm really starting to get into post-production now. I guess this is just a general question for those out there who can help me answer how I go about getting into the profession.

I'm compiling a short cinematography reel right now- it's not too long as I've only Dp'd 6 short films (I transferred relatively late into my school's program). I'd say I know a decent amount of camera and electric work- I've shot on RED and have worked with it in post as well as loaded, exposed for and shot with Super16mm. I know my way around lights too.

Right now, I'm planning to head home to New York after graduation. While New York has a lot going for it in terms of production, I'm going to try and move out to LA as soon as I can since I know that's where the bulk of the industry is.

My question (I'm rambling, I know) is how to go about it. Should I try and start off as a Camera PA or try to enter into the Grip/Electric department? I know there are grip/electric unions out there and this can complicate breaking into that field sometimes. Where do I look to find these jobs- craigslist, some other media-job aggregate service? In terms of post, do I just try to contact post-houses to see if they'll take me on as a free intern?

Sorry for what might seem like amateurish questions but I'd like to prepare myself somewhat before I dive headfirst into oblivion.

Any advice/wisdom/anecdotes you can give me would be much appreciated!"

hvtt3,9,2011-06-09,"There are no decent jobs in Miami, our only public hospital is being defunded, and our public schools can't afford paper. Rally with us on June 6th at Bayfront Park!",[deleted],Miami,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/hvtt3/there_are_no_decent_jobs_in_miami_our_only_public/,"Hey /r/miami,

So I just started this internship with the oneMiami campaign and realized that a bunch of other redditors are interning here with me, so we decided it would be cool to give the call to action here. 
The oneMiami campaign is part of a broader grassroots campaign happening in cities across the country called Fight for a Fair Economy, and we have been organizing the lower income neighborhoods of Miami so that we can build a movement to counter the corrupt politics of Florida. 

Some Background: Carnival Cruise Line pays no taxes, and they only pay 200 dollars a YEAR to be able to use the Port of Miami (!). To top it off, none of the employees on their ships are from Miami, but they often send these employees to Jackson Hospital to get free/cheap treatment. Carnival is profiting off of our city, yet they aren't REALLY giving anything back. 
Wells Fargo is also guilty of not paying any taxes, despite having their gigantic building right in Downtown. 

Rick Scotts budget is going to eliminate almost 5000 state jobs and will force local governments to carry out thousands more layoffs in city and county jobs.

Over 13 percent of people in Miami are unemployed, and in lower income neighborhoods that statistic is as high as 30 percent. Meanwhile, unemployment benefits are being cut drastically.

Florida Lawmakers have made the deepest cuts to education in Florida's history, which will bring Miami's school district to a 90 million dollar budget deficit this year!

Politicians like Rick Scott continue to skirt the interests of the public good. The Miami-Dade School Board is corrupt as heck. Jackson is the only hospital in Miami where a lot of lower income families can expect to get cared for, and it is already going to have 130 million dollars cut from its funding, putting it at serious risk of being shut down or cut back. 

The gist of it is this: Miami isn't poor, yet for some reason our government never seems to have the money for the things that we NEED as citizens. Local businesses are getting taxed to high hell while big corporations continue to pay off both major political parties so that they can continue to screw us. I know, I know, I am preaching to the choir, but hear me out. There are more of US then there are of THEM, even though they have all the money. 

We have been organizing small meetings in churches and parks in over 20 locations in the lower income neighborhoods of Miami, such as Little Haiti and Hialeah, and gathering steam as a grassroots movement. This rally is going to be the kickoff to our big collective actions. I've been phonebanking nonstop for the past few days getting commitments from people to show up for Saturday and it's looking good.

We are meeting at Bayfront Park at 1 PM, and we will have people going up as ""witnesses"" to talk about their issues. There will also be a DJ present, and we will be providing water so that we can all beat the hot sun. We have a bunch of buses providing transportation to and from the event from the various community meeting spots that I mentioned earlier so that even people who can't afford to drive out to downtown or who are elderly/disabled can still come and voice their opinion.

Come and tell your story. Graduated with a college degree but you are waiting tables because theres no better job oppurtunity? Can't find a job at all for months? You rely on Jackson Hospital to help your child when he gets sick? Your tired of seeing your local highschool beg their students for reams of paper? Tired of seeing gigantic potholes all over Miami Beaches streets? Whatever it is, come and make it known. 

We will be holding a mock ""Grand Jury"" to ""indict"" Wells Fargo, Carnival, etc. and then marching together as a huge group to the Wells Fargo Building to deliver our letter of discontent. 

I created a new account so that our campaign can continue to use reddit in the future seperate from me as an individual, but I will post under my account later so you can see who I am and scrutinize me, etc. I'll also get the other redditors to do so as well.

onemiaminow.org


TL;DR: Come to Bayfront Park at 1 PM on Saturday, June 11th, so that we can make a statement as pissed off citizens of this damn city that we are strong and unified. 

Edit: I can't change the title, but it is indeed on Saturday, June 11th, not June 6th. Fail..."

I'm in my mid twenties now. The place where I used to work was mostly male, and I worked there as an intern. Naturally some of the men there flirted with me, they tried to touch me, they would make comments about how I look. They made advances at me.

As an intern, quite a few men had a position of power over me at my job. However, I essentially *expected* them to use that power to try to get into my pants. It's natural for men to try to have sex with women if they have the opportunity to. Regardless of what you may think, I felt very happy at that position.

Now I work at an insurance company, and I'm basically treated like ""one of the guys"". I'm treated in a very formal and inauthentic manner, and I miss the excitement of having men try to get with me. I know this will make some people here mad, especially people who had to deal with harassment themselves, but I feel unattractive now. 

I think my brain at some level expects a man to try to get into my pants if he has power over me. If he doesn't, my brain makes me feel unattractive and unfeminine. I know this may sound really stupid, but I prefer ""tension"" at the workplace. 

I know many people want to be taken serious in their job and their skills, but to me that's not really relevant. I work at an insurance company. Of course my job is boring, and the company I work for unethical. 99% of all office jobs are horrible. I don't know who came up with the idea that getting a mid level management job in some giant cubicle farm would be ""liberating"" for women. I couldn't care less whether people respect my ""expertise"", as long as I get paid. I do care however about feeling like a woman. And I don't feel like a woman now. I feel like a robot.

Should I feel guilty?"

Last week I had a phone interviewer with someone in the IT department for an intern position.  This was set up by the recruiter a few days beforehand.  I felt the interview went okay.  Afterwards, he told me to give the recruiter a call and he will also give the recruiter a call with some feedback about me.  

3 days later I talked to the recruiter(the recruiter was away until then) and she says she is waiting for the interviewer to contact her about me.  Now it's been 3 days since then and I was wondering if it is appropriate for me to try calling her again to ask if he has contacted her.  She said she will call me when she hears from the IT guy, regardless of whether I get a 2nd interview or not."

Prior to graduating from college I worked for a consulting company as the office manager. I did outside sales for them, as well as creating ad materials, event planning, and had about 100 other various responsibilities. I also had an internship at a non-profit doing new media/online marketing work, and event planning.


I graduated with a degree in marketing about a year ago, was hired as the e-relations manager of a home decor company and was promptly laid off a few months later because they decided that their $1.5mil marketing budget would be best spent on TV ads ONLY even though the work I was doing was bringing them around 20 new customers every single week. (I know this because they were using my coupons.) The company was run by a very traditional Indian family who didn't seem interested in change. I'm not sure why they hired me in the first place, to be honest, other than the fact that I am very charismatic when I want to be. I was a nanny for awhile after that (best, highest paying job I've ever had, got to go in vacation with the family, and made a lifelong friend in the mom.) Now I work a shitty sales job.


I am mostly interested in new media/non-profit type positions. I also have aspirations of working in market research one day, but that's a difficult field to break into from my experience so far. I apply for about every marketing, public relations, and non-profit type position I find that I think I'm qualified for. I have a rock solid resume, and I'm charismatic. Why the FUCK can't I find a job?!


Does anyone have any recommendations on other positions I should be applying for/what direction I should be going in/any kind of new angle? I'm really frustrated.


**Edit**: Please, PLEASE don't tell me to ""network."" I was a marketing major. I know how to sell myself. I get out there and talk to as many people as possible. There just aren't many jobs in my field in this area. I'm beginning to think the only solution is to move. I'm trying to figure out ways to branch out here before jumping ship, though."

He missed me so much when I was gone during the school year that he's become incredibly attached. When I'm trying to do something, he's always next to me, begging me to play Beyblade for the hundredth time or asking to pull up netflix on half of moniter so he can watch spongebob.

I recently got an internship at a firm in VA where a lot of single-mother type women work. After a few days of bumping into the same one in the cafeteria and casually talking/flirting/glancing at each other, we went out for a coffee.

So I was wondering, what would it take for you to sleep with a 19-year-old? Currently, I want nothing more than to get her into bed, as crude as that sounds. Would it depend on looks/thrill factor, since I assume the age difference removes the possibility of 'clicking'? 

If she agreed to go on a date (and this was established as more than just a coffee), that means she must be at least a bit interested, right? Or is it just a novelty?"

This ""college"" will charge you $7,000 to place you as intern in a ""real"" recording studio or live sound company.  I mean, it's better than charging you $10K, letting you find your way through Pro Tools and kicking you out the door with a ""diploma,"" but wow... I bet they keep $2K and give an engineer $5K to have someone get coffee and and answer the phone for them for six months.  Or load PA speakers and run cable.  

(edit: ""Most"") Audio engineering schools are a joke.  With today's process of digital recording, well, it's a scam.  I obtained an Associate's Degree from a state university in 1991.  My first class was spent learning how to align tape machine heads and how to splice tape.  One of my final classes was to design and build a speaker from scratch to spec in order to prove that we correctly understood how sound works.  For extra credit, I helped treat a new monitor room the department built.  Never once touched a computer.

Not to say that there is anything wrong with the digital age of recording... it's *almost* there... but these ""Engineering"" colleges are a joke, especially this one... $7K just to find you an apprenticeship?  BWAHAHAHA

edit: Point being, there aren't too many of us left, that is, that understand how sound works and can get a decent recording with nothing more than a capture device, a microphone, a pre-amp and maybe a compressor... Now everyone just cluelessly tracks and ""fixes"" it in the box.

edit 2: I'm not saying ALL engineering schools are a joke; there are a few that won't give you a diploma until you can prove that you (somewhat) know what you're doing and actually teach you things/give you real world experience.  But the majority of them don't teach you squat other than some PT shortcuts and how to fix your tracks because they didn't teach you how to properly record them in the first place."

Midway through my undergraduate career I asked a university staffer who ran a program to help minorities (mostly organizing tutoring sessions and networking opportunities) to write me a letter of rec for an internship I was applying to. I remember that she ended the letter with "" ___ ___ (my name) is an amiable man of latino descent,"" blah blah blah. I remember being on the fence about whether or not I wanted to use that letter of rec, and whether or not I should ask her to rewrite the last line. Part of me felt like taking advantage of something so arbitrary as race was disgusting; that being said I also felt vindicated using this line since so many people assume that many of my achievements were due to my race. 

For a little bit of background, I went to a magnet high school with a very high % of asian students. When I say high, I mean that my freshmen english class was comprised of 18 asians, 3 white kids, and 2 latinos. I think out of 400 people in the magnet program there were around 20 latinos and 10 black kids, around 100 white kids, with the remainder being asian. I live in southern california and it's impossible not to recognize the difference in the racial demographics of the community vs that of the school. Anyways fast forward to senior year when we were applying to universities and the subject of race and admissions would come up all the time, and every single time the joke was made to me that I was going to get into some good school because of my race. When we got our acceptances, I got into an OK school (top 30), and by this point the joking definitely started to hurt, esp with being in such an ambitious environment people take what colleges they got into very seriously, and admissions being the crap shoot that it is. I had friends who got into better schools with worse scores, and worse schools with better scores. Maybe it was just me taking things too personally, I don't know. But it definitely started to hurt.

Going back to where I started the story, I didn't end up getting that internship that I had the letter of rec written for. But I decided afterwards that I was never going to use my race to my advantage ever again. Fuck - maybe institutional racism kept me down, maybe I am at a disadvantage, but I'll be damned if anywhere ever tries to chalk up my accomplishments to my brown skin. Since then I've had various positions which I'm proud of (most notably an internship at NASA), got a professional job at one of the top 10 companies in my field and recently got accepted into an m.s. program that's ranked top 15 for my field. Didn't use my race for any of those accomplishments and I'm not about to start. Fuck you next time you look at a minority who's gotten ahead of the field and think ""I wonder how affirmative action helped him""."

However, I've been putting off talking about some of this stuff for far too long, so I figured I should at least somewhere, and here we are.

First and foremost, yes, I am a Christian, and not a troll. 

Secondly, I am angry. Spiteful even.  Here's why:

I got married roughly 5.5 years ago to what turned out to be a manipulative, co-dependent individual. She lied her way into my life, heart, and marriage. I was ministering at a large (3,000+) member church at the time in children's ministry and was working on my pastoral license after taking a year internship when we were wed.

As those in ministry know, it is critical to have a supportive spouse who has the same calling and purpose. There was no reason for me to believe otherwise in our relationship. Or I was too young or unwilling to see it. Hindsight and all that.

Shortly after we were wed, she gave me the 'Big 3' - a list of demands that came out of nowhere: 1) Kids. NAO. 2) She doesn't want to work. 3) Buy a house.

Completely blindsided, I did my best to please my wife and walk in my calling.  I took on a second job on top of my studies and working full time+ at church. It still wasn’t enough for her – she demanded I quit the ministry and get a ‘real’ job (since the church paid so little).  She refused to go to counseling or talk to any pastors at the church because they would ‘be on my side.’ Yet, when I went to talk to them myself, all they’d tell me was that I was a pastor; figure it out. Or that I need to lead better. Or that I need to man up and run my marriage.  And thousands of other unhelpful, broad Christian-ese sayings.

I had my pastoral license a week before I left the church. But that’s another story for another time, perhaps.

As it turned out, my wife came from a rather strict family with some pretty hefty traditions, including getting married young (great grandma was 16, grandma was 17, mom was 18, etc), and pregnant within the first year. My wife was 20 when we started dating, so she was already the black sheep, and her mother was sure making her feel like it.  Her younger sister though, who was a junior in high school, was already engaged and the pride of the family.

Once we started dating, she literally did everything in her power to learn what I wanted/needed in a spouse, pretended to be that, and we got married a few months before her sister in an effort to please the will of her mother (this is where her co-dependency kicks in).

More family tradition is to run a very matriarchal household, where the husband is naught but a ‘yes-man,’ doing whatever it takes to please every whim of his wife, regardless of cost, law, or common sense.  

What I have isn’t a marriage. It isn’t a partnership. It is nothing but a lie that I am trapped in and can’t escape.

I have become severely depressed, have anxiety attacks, and have no hope for anything. Everything was going perfect, then she came into my life and sucked all the joy out of it, and, as a Christian man/father with a 2 year old and another on the way, there’s not a whole lot I can do.

Feel free to AMA.  There are a lot of details I’m skipping on since this is already a novel.  I will answer every question to the best of my ability.

Yes, I still believe in Jesus. No, I don’t understand how I’m supposed to move on from here, how to forgive my spouse for what she’s done (boy have I tried), or how I could possibly have a happy life of anything other than going through the motions and waiting to die.

I am trapped between marriage, morals, convictions, depression, common sense, self-preservation, and the Bible. How do get my life back again? How do I become happy again? How do I become useful again?

**Tl:dr – ex pastor who got manipulated into marriage, is trapped, fighting severe depression, and has no positive outlook on life or hope whatsoever.**

I need your help to achieve the impossible, to me at least. In order to secure an internship position in Singapore, due to limited opening and competitiveness, I am asked to compete with about 20 other people around the world in a marketing competition where I need to have 250 people to sign up in the shortest time possible for this new “Facebook-like” site called MyCube (the employer). 

I don’t know where to turn to in order to get 250 people in the shortest amount of time. I don’t even have that many friends on Facebook. So I apologize in advance if it looks like I am trying to spam Reddit. But this has a deeper meaning.

Getting this internship in Singapore will be very meaningful for me as I have been in a long distance relationship (~15,000 km) for almost 1.5 years. I can’t afford the flight from Toronto to Singapore this summer because I will be doing my Master in September. Hence, I need to save up for rent/tuition. However, if I can get that internship, my flight to Singapore will be taken care of by the employer.

She does not know about this yet and I would like to give her a pleasant surprise. If any of you Redditors could a spare moment and be one of the 250 people, I thank you deeply. Please help me by going [here](http://beta.mycube.com) and use the activation code: *mczengyih* . In return, you will receive 1000 Cubes (~$8) in your account upon signing up, which you could use to “purchase” some of the contents there.

hw7nx,7,2011-06-10,My father seems to be giving up.,worriedson42,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hw7nx/my_father_seems_to_be_giving_up/,"I received a phone call today from my uncle (aunt's second husband who happens to be a doctor) about my diabetic father.  He was reaching out to me because, as he put it, he couldn't stand by and not reach out to me and my siblings while my dad allowed his health to deteriorate to the point that he could hurt himself of die.

According to to my uncle, my 58 year old father has consciously not been taking his insulin, he's dropped a bunch of weight, and is most likely suffering from some kind of clinical depression.  My uncle has also told me that my father has been lying about taking his insulin and that when finally caught in the lie, expressed that his reason for not taking his medication is that he no longer wants to live.

The depression thing isn't really something out of the blue, my dad checked himself into a psychiatric hospital shortly after leaving (some would say abandoning) my mother and me and my brother and sister.  I didn't actually find out about this psychiatric episode until years later.  My sister and I happened to be in college at the time, but my brother was 15 and still finishing high school.  Our house ended up getting foreclosed on and things were pretty tough for a while there.  I'm pretty sure he's been on some regiment of anti-depressants, zoloft, prozac, etc. since.

My mother thinks that my father may suffer from undiagnosed bi-polar disorder and talks about how he would have these manic phases followed by, as she put it, ""hitting rock bottom"".

A little context would help here, I think.  My dad founded and owned a very successful home building company in the 80's.  At one point, he was a millionaire, had a company jet, nice cars, etc.  My mom refers that that as the ""Gatsby days"".  Apparently there was some kind of scandal between him and a young intern at the company and he was forced out of the company that he founded with his brother.  Things seemed ok for a while, from the perspective of an 10 year old anyway.

As I got older, I noticed that we stopped going on vacation, my mom had to get a job substitute teaching so that we had healthcare for my younger brother who had asthma since my dad was technically self-employed (he was a real estate developer), things stopped getting fixed around the house, etc. and then my dad had an episode with his health where he went into a diabetic coma and from that point forward, he was a diabetic, making getting health insurance even more difficult.

Flash forward to my sophomore year in college and my father is having to go out of state to find work as a building contractor and one day just isn't answering calls and we find out that my mom and brother have to be out of the house we grew up in because it is being foreclosed.

Eventually my dad divorced my mom, which is really strange since she probably had more of a reason to divorce than he did and she still wanted to work things out.

To say that the relationship between my father and his kids was strained would be an understatement. From the age of 20 until about 28, I probably spoke to my father less than 10 times.  We were all still reeling from our family, as we knew it, being torn apart when he left, although my younger sister and brother seemed to reach out to him earlier than I did.

They say time heals all wounds and eventually we all began having a somewhat ""normal"" relationship with our dad, to the point that we keep up with each other on a pretty consistent basis, which can be difficult since everyone in my immediate family live in different cities (although in the same region).  He happens to be a pretty fun, funny, intelligent guy to hang out with, now that we're all adults.

So the most current status is that he has been living in my aunt and uncle's second house, rent free, for the past 2 years, I believe he was living with his mother before that, and had remarried and then divorced before that.  He has been having a hard time finding work.  He works as a contractor and the economy hasn't been so hot in the housing sector, in case you hadn't heard.  I've also come to discover that he's having legal trouble, the nature of which I hope to discover when I go visit him this weekend with my brother.  He's supposed to be going to the doctor tomorrow to get a check up and get back on insulin, as well as get his head scanned.  Part of the new found focus seems to be from that fact that my sister is pregnant again after miscarrying her first pregnancy, although I hope this is more than just trying to prevent himself from dying before her first child is born so as not to stress out my sister and put the pregnancy in jeopardy.  I hope he has a genuine intrest in seeing his first grandchild born and grow up.

I feel like my dad's life has seen a lot of great success, only to be punctuated by great loss.  He lost a fortune, for a time, his family, and now he can't find consistent work, is most likely being sued, and is bumming a place to stay off his brother-in-law.  He's always had a veneer of contentment and happiness, although lately it seems like most of the conversations I've been having with him are rote and pretty superficial.  He doesn't really want to share anything real about how he's doing, just that he hasn't been ""handling things very well"" and that he doesn't want to burden us.  He's also always been a proud, if not completely honest, man.

I and my siblings do love him very much and I don't want to see him give up and maim himself or die because life is hard.  This whole thing seems really passive aggressive.  He doesn't seem happy and when I pressed him about trying to turn things around with his health and with his life, there was an aire of uncertainty about the whole thing that was very disconcerting.

I know that we have to be supportive and let him know that the people in his life love and care what happens to him.  I don't think he's a lost cause.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text.  I needed to get that off my chest.

Thanks."

However, after finishing my first week, I'm starting to have mixed feelings about how it's going. Just for background, I just finished my third year in a five year masters.

There are many obvious things that shocked me; how different it is from school, how you communicate in the office, how responsibility is managed. And I am keeping my head high and working as hard as I can to do my best, but for the most part I feel pretty worthless. 

I'm trained in Revit and SketchUp (no autocad...working on that right now), but their Revit models are very complicated compared to what I'm used to. In addition to that, for the first time in my life, details in computer models really matter; if I get a wall an inch off, it's a big issue. I guess that the other thing is my struggle with construction documents. I understand how many different types of wall constructions go together, but I couldn't draw that much from scratch and especially be able to call out dimensions off the top of my head when it comes to really specific pieces like flashing and wall sweep pieces.

I'm currently going through a book and many online videos and tutorials to try and increase my knowledge of Revit and types of building constructions, but I feel like I spend most of my day asking questions and staring at my screen hopelessly. Does anybody have any advice (I know that it will get better...I've never gotten better at anything from people telling me that I'm doing great), but I just feel like I'm not working in the right direction.


UPDATE: Thought I would give a small update since I am finishing my second week today. Everything got so much better. I started working on multiple different projects, people are constantly coming to me with work to do or check, and now that I am more familiar with how they use Revit and their printers (still working on the autocad...) I am actually pretty useful. It's a pretty small firm, and I think my work in the last three days allowed two of the actual intern architects have time to go spend with their family and friends instead of staying several hours after work to meet a deadline. I've even gotten a few compliments. 

I also have started asking tons of questions, and have started religiously filling my notebook with every little bit that I learn. And the archives of old projects has been very useful too. So, thank you for the encouragement and advice; it really has helped! "

I trudged through a bachelors in Finance and did slightly mediocre due to my lack of interest. I realized too late that I wanted to make a career in to marketing and by then I was pretty much a semester away from graduating.

For the past year I did a marketing internship and now being a consultant for a startup company. I currently have a part time job that pays very well for the most part on weekends and no qualms of that.

Recently I took a trip to the west coast and met some people who were willing to help me with a job offer either there or in another state in the east coast. I thought this was awesome, finally able to pursue my career into something I might enjoy. I arrived back and told my parents.

At first there was nothing said. They didn't seem to think I was serious. As I constantly kept mentioning to them I guess started to hit them that I might want to live out of the state.

I'm at work and I get a call from my mom just a few minutes ago what the starting salary would be. I told her that I really don't know since I haven't even applied yet...may be around 55-65k just to be safe. She starts freaking out telling that if the starting salary is that low she wont accept me going there? WTF?

Her argument is that if it take a starting salary like that, then when I apply for other jobs in the future they wont want to offer me anything more than that. I always thought the more experience you have will always get you a better starting salary at your next job depending on how much they want you.

I'm so tired of this. I feel hindered by everything they expect me to do. I respect them as my parents and listen to them whenever I feel their advice is sound but this is just ridiculous. This my career, this is something I want to enjoy and they expect me to be some top tier guy making 100k a year as a starting salary. 

I start boiling up with so much anger its unberable. I feel so fucking chained to this situation and no matter how much I try to politely explain it to them they never listen. They're stubborn, they don't think i know anything of what I'm talking about when the fact is I went through the education system here and they did not.

What do I do? I don't know who else to turn to anymore. I feel like my life is going to be completely ruined and just feel a horrible sense of stress and anxiety.

This may sound ridiculous and I know that what I did was dumb and awful, so please, dont be so hard on the comments... :/

My boyfriend(20) and I(19), being in a serious long distance relationship for more than a year (been close friends ever since we were 14), made honesty our number one priority, but a couple days ago, he messed it up... for something extremely stupid. It bothers me so much, because HE was the one who used to make honesty such a big deal in this relationship and he told me that he absolutely HATES liars, and so I decided, after some wrongdoings that I did in the past, that I'll never make the mistake of lying to him again. 

I'll get to the point so this post doesn't end up extremely long.
Two nights ago, my boyfriend called me at midnight like he occasionally does every night. We talked for no more than 20 minutes when he told me that he was extremely exhausted and wanted to go to sleep. I wanted to talk to him longer because we havent really had a ""real"" conversation in such a long time, but I didn't want him to have to stay awake, hearing how ""tired"" he was. So we hung up. I was a bit sad because we didn't talk for too long... 

[Something I should note: usually, with our LDR, he lives in Pennsylvania and I live in California, so that's about a 3 hour difference. For the summer though, he got an intern in California, there's no difference in time.]

Anyways, two hours later, I go on my facebook and see a post that he made a few seconds before. It was a post of the very hot actress that I've been having jealousy problems with (see my previous/first note that explains this whole stupidity with the actress &gt;.&lt; shortlink: redd.it/hvfvt) and with that picture, a caption saying something like ""OMG. *fapfapfap*"" I seriously cannot explain the feeling I got in my chest. Note: my boyfriend KNOWS how much of a problem I have with this actress because of previous incidents, but for this time, I really felt like it wasn't just because of her. He truly sounded VERY tired over the phone. Even though I wanted to talk to him SO BADLY, I let him go BECAUSE he said he was going to sleep. Two hours later, I find this post and he is obviously not sleeping. He went to go watch his T.V. shows that this actresses was in, and decided to look at more pictures of her on the internet  instead of talking to me, his girlfriend who he hasn't spoken to for a while, a litte longer on the phone. 
After a few seconds, the post got deleted and my boyfriend posts a status update that said, ""stupid roommates...."" Knowing him, I knew it wasn't his roommates because 1.) he told me before that he was going to have his own room in his apartment and 2.) he is a very private person when it comes down to his computer and his accounts and rarely lets anyone else use it, so I knew something was up. I posted a comment saying ""sweetie, we all know it wasn't your roommates ;]"" and he replies something like ""darling, if I intended to post that picture myself, I would've worded the caption differently."" and after that I was just like ""watever lol."" 
After that, I stayed up all night because it was bothering me and I had to study for a test for school, and I also posted my first post on reddit. I didn't hear anything back from my boyfriend until that morning (the morning after the facebook post night) and he just texted me something stupid about a dream that he had, and didn't mention anything about what happened the previous night. I ignored it and didn't text anything back. 

After that, I didn't hear anything back or talk to him for two days. 

Earlier tonight, he finally called because he knew I was upset about something. He explained what happened that night because he knew I was upset and he told me and admitted that he lied to me just so he can keep his image on facebook and his friends. He told me he accidentally posted that picture on his wall when he intended to post it on his friend's, and that he tried to cover that up by putting the status about his ""stupid roommates"" and replied to my comment as another coverup. He thought that since I made the right assumption that his roommates didn't post that up on his wall, that I already knew what was going on and he didn't have to explain himself. He tried to tell me that he wasn't trying to lie to me, but he just trying to ""lie to the people on facebook""(those were is actual words). Well guess what, I was one of those people on facebook. He kept making excuses. He thinks this whole thing is stupid because it was on facebook. He hates facebook. He told me that he had every intention on telling me the truth after, but I did not get a phone call or a text after he lied to me, saying that he lied to cover up his mistake. Honestly, if he had told me that right after it happened, I'd be a bit more understandable and okay with it. 
I know it sounds stupid, but I cannot and don't know how much more emphasis to put when I say that he made HONESTY our NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. He has always been a decent guy. Trustworthy, supportive, everything a girl can ask for in a boyfriend, but he throws that all away on this stupid thing just so he can ""keep his image"" on facebook. Honestly, I don't care what kind of lie it was; a lie is a lie, right? 


I know this whole thing is stupid and we're both being immature, especially me. I know I should just be able to let this one pass and forget about it, and I want to so badly because I really did love him so much, but with the condition that I am in, I know I cant. I know I'm still young and immature. I am totally aware of that. That's why I ended things with him. Honestly, if I wasn't so dumb and messed up emotionally/mentally in the head, things would've worked out, but I have so many problems and trust issues that I know I shouldn't deal with having a relationship like this (especially a LDR). He knew how bad my issues with trust were, but he did this to me anyways. This hurts me so much. I am obviously not ready for a serious relationship like this one was and I am too stupidly young. 

I admit that I impulsively ended it with him, but I did the right thing, right? For the both of us?...
I'm sorry if you thought this was a waste of time to read... :/ I am still a foolish young lady. "

* I'm not afraid to work
* I don't think low-prestige work is ""beneath me""
* I didn't give up and move in with my parents... I got any shitty job I could to support myself.

When I was in pharmacy school, I got to learn a lot about pathophysiology and disease processes. One entire section we covered was all about cardiovascular disease and it said that hypertension is a risk factor. Normal blood pressure to 80/50 to about 120/80, pre-hypertension is 120/80 to 139/89, hypertension is 140/90 and above. Pretty cool stuff, right?

So I'm walking in wal-mart doing my normal shopping and I see one of those electronic blood pressure machines and I decide to try it out. The results were 165/98 and it scared the shit out of me. I called my friend that was a Wal-Mart intern and asked him about the machines and he said they're pretty accurate. Shit.

The following Monday, I'm in one of my classes and I start feeling my pulse in my hands going crazy. I palpate my pulse and it's going crazy...like 13 or 14 in a 5 second interval. So I run out and go to the emergency because I really feel like I'm having a cardiovascular event or something. After 8 hours in the emergency room, the doc tells me I have sinus arrhythmia (which is normal and my family doctor says the same thing...just means that my natural pacemaker in my heart is responding to my breathing patterns).

I really wasn't the same since and I've had off and on bouts. I've begun to accept the fact that I'm 100% healthy and there really isn't anything wrong with me. After I finally engraved that in my mind, all of the little ticks that used to set me off don't. I would get these weird prick like feelings in my chest or a twitch my arm or leg and I just shrug it off.

I feel better when I talk about it with others and get reassurance. Anybody else have an experience like that? Hopefully my story can reassure others that you aren't crazy! You aren't crazy!

Greetings, Redditors!,

I am subletting a small room in Hayes Valley starting next Saturday (June 18) for $950/month.

The room itself is rather small (9' x 9'), but it comes fully furnished with a full size bed and large 8 drawer clothing cabinet. There are other two roommates who you'll be living with.

T is a mid 20's Dartmouth Grad working at a prominent online software company. He is rarely at home, but loves to hang out on the weekends.

G is also a mid 20's Dartmouth Grad working as a consultant in the Financial District. He loves to run, workout and cook. 

This is a drug free household. That means no 420. **Selling drugs is not permitted either. **

This is a great place for someone new to the city or an intern here for the summer. The place is available from June 18th (flexible) to the the end of August.

There is no TV. Pics coming soon.

 During December and April I worked part time at my dads business when he needed the extra help. Once I got to FL I started hunting for jobs in Tampa and around the surrounding area. I hit up Monster, Craigslist, CareerBuilder, etc. No one wants to hire an entry level person. 

I got an email from an Insurance company, that said they wanted to hire someone fresh out of college to be a salesperson. They invited me to come in and give my resume and all that shit. I gave in to them. They said I'd need to take some online classes then do a week of training. I wouldn't be paid it would be all commission.

I was completely honest with the firm about everything during the interview... thought I would learn on the job.

Now, at work people are talking to me in terms I do not understand. Relational databases versus hierarchical databases? ODBC? JDBC? Handles? Syntax diagrams? Parameters? Functions? Commands? How does using html and xml somehow interact with a database??... how are they even related?? What are modules, objects, and source files??

In the first week or two, it seemed like editing documentation would be easy... they were spoonfeeding me on what needed to be changed, how to do it, etc. Fast-fwd to today, and I'm so lost on these things.

So..  how can I quickly learn these basics? The terminology.. and a broad understanding of databases, and how and why things are accessing them. 

I don't understand even the big picture of how the large databases work, and why. So.. large companies have servers for databases, then businesses can use them to add their data to... and using the interface installed on their local machines, these businesses can interact with this data? Is that right?

If someone has resources for me that can give me a crash course, that would be hugely helpful. First of all the terminology, and second of all some background on databases. Even the wiki articles are confusing me.

Thanks so much to those who help!!

Edit: Thanks to those who gave great information and to those who gave encouragement. I don't want to know how 'screwed' I am though.. I can already determine my level of screwed. The subreddit name is learnprogramming, and that's what I came here to do. Thanks again to those who are helping."

I recently moved into my own apartment after starting a new internship. I'd like to think that I'm a decent cook, but I'm severely limited by my lack of cooking utensils. I have a cookbook (the Better Homes and Gardens one) but unfortunately I only have a pan and a pot which cuts down on the recipes I can cook with (found either through the cookbook or off the internet).  There are ways around this (I bake cookies with a piece of tinfoil wrapped around an oven rack), but I am looking for recipes that can be made with my limited collection of cooking implements! 

Suggestions? Thanks!"
hxi1k,36,2011-06-11,"Serious Cat Situation - Please, can anyone help?",duckduckCROW,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hxi1k/serious_cat_situation_please_can_anyone_help/,"This is going to be a bit of a long story. I know that I am partially at fault so please don't go out of your way to point that out; I promise that will make me cry. Also, please please please don't tell me to just kill them all. I won't and that will also make me cry. I'm a bit of a baby lately. 

I moved into a house on a fairly big lot about 6 years ago. When I moved in, there was a fairly well established feral cat colony already established. I did not realize how big of a problem it was until after I was living here. I didn't know much about feral cat colonies at the time. I though we could ignore them and they would go away. Nope. They killed things and fought and got really really sickly. I felt bad so I started feeding them and trapping some of them to take the the vet. There, they were fixed, given their shots, and returned to my house. I tamed some of them and found them homes. I wormed the ones that I couldn't catch. I was told that even if I removed all of them or put them all down, once a property was used as a site for a feral colony, there would always be a colony there. This seems to be true. It doesn't matter how low the numbers get. More always show up. Early on, when the numbers were really low (three uncatchable feral cats), I started taking in rescues. At this point, people in my small town knew that I would do everything in my power to help sick, hurt, abused, neglected, or homeless animals. Someone would tell me about a cat that was living in a crack house and was being abused and I would show up and not leave until I had the cat. I would help rehab it and place it. People would drop cats off at my property and I would deal with them. At this time, I made decent money and could afford to help. Everything was under control. 

Today, things are very much out of control. At least, that is how I feel at the moment. A number of things happened all at once and everything is a mess. I had to help my mom out financially because my little sister started having severe mental health issues and we ended up with a ton of medical bills. My hours were cut at my job (same with the rest of the staff). I now make less than $3000 a year. I am in graduate school and have to finish an unpaid internship before I can graduate. I love it but it takes a lot of time. I made it through college with very little debt but now I am taking out student loans just to help with my cat/financial situation. I am the first person in my family to go to college. Graduate school is a huge freaking deal to them. I can't quit now when I am so close to being done. I recognize that some of this is just my own pride but I was the kid in town who came from the bad family and I wasn't supposed to amount to anything at all (but that is another story). 

Some of the oldest cats that couldn't be caught have had kittens. People keep dropping off cats without even talking to me. Fewer people are willing to take them in. I spend hundreds of dollars every month on food, vet bills, spaying/neutering, shots, flea meds, wormer, etc. I really can't afford it anymore but I do it. I've contacted cat houses, the humane society, and a few other organizations in Nebraska but I can't find any help outside of paying to have them put down or paying $70 a cat to put them in a shelter where they may or may not be put down. The Cat House is full. I do attend an annual spay and neuter clinic but even with the discount, it is expensive. Last month, my bill was about $400 for 5 cats (shots, wormer, 1 spayed, 4 neutered). Furthermore, people in my town have started doing horrible things to animals (not just mine). Animals are being shot, poisoned, tortured, drugged, drowned, and disappearing. I was in the process of building a cat fence before my financial situation fell apart but now I can't afford it. I'm really scared. I have a cat that needs surgery but I can't get it. It isn't a life or death situation but she needs her left eye removed and I just don't have the money. I feel bad. 

I regularly donate and help others IRL. When I work, I solicit donations from patrons to help with different causes. I have received some help from people in my community (e.g., bags of cat food, a vet bill paid) but I've run out of people to ask. This is a small town. Those who are willing to help with the cats already have and the rest are not willing. I'm not asking anyone to send me money or anything, I'm just looking for ideas on where to go or resources that I can look into. I did post on a different subreddit today where a person was offering help for people in need of pet food. I will be posting proof later. I'm not sure what all I should provide but I'm planning on posting pics of some of the cats, vet bills, a facebook post where I talked about animals being abused in town, a post offering kittens free to a good home, and a pic of one of my pay stubs. If you want anything else, let me know. 

TL;DR I tried to help cats when I was able to do so. I am no longer able to do as much and will be struggling for the next few months. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I will return the favor when I am done with my internship and able to get a better job. 

If you want the town that I live in or my phone number or anything, please pm me. I am uncomfortable posting those things. 

**EDIT: PROOF:**
I have uploaded some photos of a few of the cats (more to follow because we have a ton now), a few of the vet bills (same), one of my most recent pay stubs, and some old facebook posts about the things being done to pets.

**Edit** - changed imgur to an album because I missed one person's information on facebook and can't delete the pic. So I made it private and put everything else in a public album - added a fixed version of that picture as well as screenshots of a donation I received today from a redditor who has just blown me away. I cannot thank this person enough.

**Edit**

I wanted to give some numbers in terms of how many cats are currently here and how many are feral. 

We have 5 feral cats left over from the original colony. These cats have been wormed but not fixed. 4 are females and 1 is male.

We have 2 black cats that were dropped off and are mostly tame They act like they really want to be pets. One of the black ones was pregnant when she was dropped off. She has had 3 kittens (the gray, black, and black and white ones in the photos). I am unsure about their vet history. They are not fixed so that is on the agenda. Same with shots and wormer.

We have 1 male black and white cat that was beaten pretty badly. He is learning to trust people again. He has his shots but isn't fixed. This is on the agenda.

We have 1 really old yellow tomcat that was left at a house after his owner was placed in a nursing home. Her children don't want him so now he is here. His face is messed up from a dog attack. We've been putting antibiotics on it but need to take him to a vet. 

We have 1 tame cat with a genetic eye problem. She has been fixed and has all shots. No one wants a cat who is going blind. 

We have 1 tame long haired black cat that lived in a meth house. He is fixed and has all of his shots. I'm also trying to find him a home. 

We have 1 Siamese mix. He was found when he was two weeks old and bottle fed. He has a bunch of anxiety problems and has been poisoned in the past. He can't be placed because he is neurotically attached to me. He has his shots and has been fixed.

We have 1 long hair gray and white cat that was literally stuck to the highway during winter. He has been fixed and has his shots.

We have 1 short hair siamese looking cat with an eye that needs removed. She came from the cat with the bad eye that was mentioned above. She will also go blind. She has all of her shots and has been fixed. 

We have 2 male tiger striped cats that have seizure disorders. They are fixed and have shots. They also came from a meth house. 

We have 1 big gray cat and 1 big long haired orange cat. They were my first cats. They're mother was hit by a car when they were kittens. The others from the litter died and my professor gave them to me to bottle feed. He was going to put them down. The gray one has rolling back syndrome. 

We also currently have 2 long hair gray/white siamese-ish kittens (6 weeks old and tame), 1 tiger striped/calico male kitten (6 weeks old and tame), 1 yellow male kitten (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black female kitten (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a white tip on his tale (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a calico face (tame and 8 weeks old), 3 tiger striped kittens and 1 yellow kitten that are special needs kittens. They were born in someone's basement and the mother disappeared. They were almost dead when they were brought over. They are being bottle fed at the moment. They will need a lot of attention. I think they are about 5 weeks old. I don't know if anyone will ever take them. All of these kittens need homes.

I've never owned a smartphone before but I've always had my eye on Android primarily for the openess of the platform. My summer internship has me building an app for Android so I've played around on company test phones - And I want one. Not necessarily the one I used (It was kinda meh) but an Android.

Currently I'm signed up with AT&amp;T through my dad (family plan I think; I don't know too much details, I never bothered to ask) so I went to the local AT&amp;T store to just browse a bit. They had 3 phones. 2 were $99$ and one was $199 The one I played with for a few minutes was a $99 htc insight. The $199 one was a Samsung I think but I forget the name.  A quick google gives me Infuse. I'm not sure, but it had the biggest screen (obviously for double the price.)

Now my question, reddit, is what should I get? Should I look to other carriers? I did no research on other phones in case it would cost a butt-load more money to switch but I found a nice phone. Is there a 'coming really soon phone/price drop' that I should wait for? 

As for what I'm looking for in a phone, I'd explore apps/games a lot as well as video, music and camera... so pretty much everything a smart phone does? That doesn't really help now does it... And for price, since the $99 Inspire looked pretty damn nice, and money is a bit tight, that ball park is pretty good. But I can go higher if it's really special. Not counting for an sd card though (probably around another ~100 I think... Want to get either 16 or 32gb.)

Anyway, I thought I'd bring the question to Reddit for myself and perhaps other new smartphone adopters. Thanks in advance!

tl;dr: Never bought a Smartphone. Want android. What do?"

We entered our marriage with her smoking cigarettes sparingly, a habit I disgust and when she returned back from her one year away at law school she was a full blown pot head.

She hits the bowl as soon as she wakes up.  Every hour throughout the day she keeps hitting her bowl.  She wakes up 2-3 times while I am sleeping to again hit the bowl.  I have tried getting her help with a counselor but that backfired and just ended up being a friend that costed $20 copay a session.

Right now she has an apartment in NYC and I live in New Jersey but she is living with me because she is afraid to be alone.  She really doesn't have any friends and she is sad that she doesn't have any.

Even without a job she thinks she is better than me because she went to law school and feels that she is entitled to a high paying job even though she has never proven herself outside of academia.  I want to end our relationship right now and kick her out if she does not stop smoking cigarettes and marijuana.  "

The main problem is that I'm living in my college town and during the summer the population goes down by nearly a third to a half, so most employers don't hire until the fall, when students return.  At least that's what I've been hearing.

It's my fault for getting started so late on the job hunt, but now I'm just trying to come up with ideas on what to do this summer.  So if you have any ideas on where to look for a job, possible internship opportunities that might still be available, or some other creative way to spend my time (and make money) I'd love to hear them.

about me - I'm studying entrepreneurship at a good business school with a minor in music and I have a 3.8 GPA, I'm the sales director at the student radio station during the school year, I've had experience as an IT intern at a bank, a senator's aide at the state senate, I work at the local food bank during the school year (for work study), and I've had a couple of fast food jobs.  I'm also in the Midwest area.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, all of the rejections and no-call backs are getting discouraging.

I've been a computer geek since 1987. I currently use Windows for my desktop, and Linux for my server. I started out using DOS 3.3, and have used Windows 3.1/3.11, 95, 98, 98SE, ME, XP, Vista, 7. My Linux knowledge is a bit less - I currently use CentOS for my cPanel server at a datacentre in Canada. I can get around, and used Linux as my desktop for an internship a couple of years ago, but I'm a bit lighter. I have played with Mac a little bit, but not much, and I think it was OS 8, which says how little I played with it. :)

I was diagnosed with ADHD^2 at age 30, so my resume before then is a bit patchy. Since then, too, as I've struggled to go back to college. I've done well with my employment since then, but I live in a very non-technical city, so it's very difficult to find work here. I extended a one-semester paid internship with the US Forest Service into an entire year.

If you'd like to find out more about just what all I've done, let me know. Let's talk about what experience and solutions I can bring to your table.

*^1 Both are the same - one has my name, one's easier to put in a link...*

*^2 I choose to disclose because it helps you understand my resume; also, the great thing about having ADHD is that I hyperfocus on things I'm interested in, i.e. programming, etc. So I'm a better-than-average worker because of it.*"

He has been gone not quite two weeks. This weekend he had to go home for a cousin's wedding. The story I got was this:

He and the bridesmaid had been dancing together at the wedding. After the reception, the younger crowd went out to a bar. While at the bar, the bridesmaid kissed him on the cheek and he did nothing to stop her or let her know it was inappropriate given he had a girlfriend. After the bar closed, the group walked over to a place to eat. At some point, the two of them ended up outside and started making out. Given his description, they made out for at least a few minutes and there was upper body groping involved. Finally, he said he couldn't do it anymore and stopped.

I happened to be up late that night watching Bones on Netflix, when he got home he gchatted me and confessed to what happened. 

He has never cheated on me before, but he did cheat on his long-term ex-girlfriend in a similar manner and had said previously that he had already learned his lesson that cheating is bad. 

Other problems in the relationship include that I'm in a settle down period in my life and he is not. I'm not pushing marriage, but when we both graduate from grad school next year....I had assumed we would move somewhere together. This is complicated by the fact that he doesn't like his chosen profession....this has caused him a great deal of inner conflict. I had hoped this summer would be a good chance for him to take a step back from the pressure and figure his life out. At the end of his absence we would come out stronger.

Instead, he cheats after ten days being gone. 

Any advice on how to move forward would be appreciated. Not sure if we should break up. After telling me abou the bridesmaid, he admitted that he want a ""break"" this summer to ""explore"" other people (he hasn't had many partners). However, he knew that taking a break would mean the end of our relationship and he doesn't want us to break up, as I am ""perfect"" for him. Also I'm not sure if he will cheat again. I can't stop thinking about him and constantly want to call him but I'm trying to hold back. 

Thoughts? What should I do?

the plan: otherwise I am trying to find a volunteer/internship opportunity. I emailed someone who interviewed me last year to try an informational interview and see if I could volunteer there; and I figure since one of my only really skills is writing, I've contacted a few advertising agencies to see if they have any copywriting/editing volunteering I could do.

right now, I'm slated to go back to community college for a couple years and try to transfer into an engineering program. was always quite good at math and physics so I figure I'll give it a go. otherwise, totally lost. no idea what field I want to work in. getting rejected/no calls for months for things like cashier, clerk, etc. really feel like the town is limiting my options - san antonio is nearby though, but not sure how to even break into anything there. how the hell do you figure out what to do?"

I'm from New York but when I got the chance to take this job out in the tropics I LEAPED at it.  Big freaking mistake.

Most of my coworkers suck.  My job has this really strict diversity policy, so they picked up the most useless fucks they could find that just happened to be a minority.  The black guy rocks, he pulls his weight and we get along pretty well, but the rest of them are awful.  There's this hot chick that I thought I had a chance with, but I can't understand a word she's saying because of her thick Russian accent.  All she ever does is blow hot air around and get pissed off when none of us understand what she’s saying.  The other chick is so stereotypically Asian it hurts.  She's on her computer all of the damn time and half the time is completely useless, the other half of the time she completely ignores OSHA compliance--she nearly drowned me once.  We also have an intern that I want to beat into a pulp.  I called him useless to his face once and nearly got fired for it, but it was the truth.  This kid can't do a damn thing right and constantly whines about it instead of picking up the slack and trying harder.

On top of that I have not one but TWO layabout bosses.  My first boss is happy to order us around all the time, but almost never lifts a finger to help even when she has nothing better to do and in many cases could do the task better.  My second boss is hardly ever there and won't show up until he's gotten a call from each of us.  After that he'll pop in, do a couple of things, and then leave again.  It's so bad that we won't bother trying to get ahold of him until the last possible second if we can manage it.

Anyway, we're the Planeteers and you can be one too."

Here in France it's like this :

After high-school you apply to a a medical school of your choice 

* first year is the PCEM 1 (Premier Cycle d'Etudes Médicales 1 (Which has recently been renamed to PAES)), at the end of the first year only a certain amount of students are allowed to pass on. The total number of second year is set by the Ministry of Health. Currently it is set at 7400, which translates roughly to a 15% passing rate for the first year students.

* Second year is PCEM 2, the material covered during the first two year is somewhat like what Americans cover during pre-med/

* Third to Six year are called DCEM (Deuxième Cycle d'Etudes Médicales) 1 to 4. During the first 3 you cover all the material for Epreuves Classantes Nacionales at the end of the DCEM 4. The ECN is a big exam taken simultaneously by all 6th year med-school students (all 7400 of them), depending on your ranking you may choose both your specialty and where you wish to work. If you want to be able to work in Paris you have to be amongst the first 3300. During the whole DCEM yhe day is divided into being at the hospital in the morning and going to class the afternoon.

* After that you enter the TCEM, you gain the status of intern. To finish your studies you have to take a certain amount of specialty courses, and write a thesis.

That's pretty much it! So what grueling system are you guys trying to work your way through?"

I'm still a college student, but I'm at a great state school with in the top 10% as a Sociology and Communication Major and a Philosophy Minor (lol Barista).

I guess I'm asking reddit if any of you know any ways to look for internships in Japan, especially in the realm of research or marketing. I can speak elementary Japanese but I'm making a point to learn it on my own. I'm also curious if any of you know what graduate school is like in Japan, how hard is it to get in, or what you need, and what schools would be phenomenal for Sociology.

She can't find any housing.  She's been going over every available housing resource (Craigslist/Observer Classified/SMU sublet threads/Google...) obsessively for the past 3 weeks, sending out dozens of emails and getting no helpful replies (plenty of super creepy ones though).  She's an unbelievably cool girl, and my best friend, and the stress about housing is ruining her summer.  She might even have to cancel the internship, which is pretty much her dream job, if she can't find a place to stay that's close to her budget (corporate housing &amp; even extended stay hotels are too expensive - do-gooding doesn't pay as well as corporate law) and I really don't want to see that happen.  Any help would be appreciated more than you can imagine.  If you have a place to stay, that would obviously be perfect, but if you only have some advice on where to look, I would still be really grateful.

Edit:  thanks so much for the tips so far.  Reading over my original post I feel like I wasn't as clear as I should have been about her difficulties in finding a place.  The biggest constraint (maybe tied with budget) is that she will only be renting for about 6 weeks.  She has found a lot of people willing to rent at a price she can afford, but not for the dates she'll be in town.  Also, she's working in downtown Dallas but will live anywhere.

I will, however, buy the game as soon as I get the chance. No doubt about it. It has given me so much entertainment, I don't see how not paying for it would do it any justice. Also I've punished myself by only playing on single player, and not even bothering to try to play on the cracked servers. I'm sure multiplayer is way cooler that living in an infinite world alone.
Sure, this is not a good excuse, as I'm sure there are alternatives to online credit cards, but I'm too lazy to look for them. I'm probably travelling abroad this summer for an internship, so hopefully, the country I'll be visiting will have a more decent banking sector where putting your money online isn't as ""scary"" as we think."

http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hxi1k/serious_cat_situation_please_can_anyone_help/

Someone suggested that I come to this subreddit. I am following any and all leads.

This is going to be a bit of a long story. I know that I am partially at fault so please don't go out of your way to point that out; I promise that will make me cry. Also, please please please don't tell me to just kill them all. I won't and that will also make me cry. I'm a bit of a baby lately.

I moved into a house on a fairly big lot about 6 years ago. When I moved in, there was a fairly well established feral cat colony already established. I did not realize how big of a problem it was until after I was living here. I didn't know much about feral cat colonies at the time. I though we could ignore them and they would go away. Nope. They killed things and fought and got really really sickly. I felt bad so I started feeding them and trapping some of them to take the the vet. There, they were fixed, given their shots, and returned to my house. I tamed some of them and found them homes. I wormed the ones that I couldn't catch. I was told that even if I removed all of them or put them all down, once a property was used as a site for a feral colony, there would always be a colony there. This seems to be true. It doesn't matter how low the numbers get. More always show up. Early on, when the numbers were really low (three uncatchable feral cats), I started taking in rescues. At this point, people in my small town knew that I would do everything in my power to help sick, hurt, abused, neglected, or homeless animals. Someone would tell me about a cat that was living in a crack house and was being abused and I would show up and not leave until I had the cat. I would help rehab it and place it. People would drop cats off at my property and I would deal with them. At this time, I made decent money and could afford to help. Everything was under control.

Today, things are very much out of control. At least, that is how I feel at the moment. A number of things happened all at once and everything is a mess. I had to help my mom out financially because my little sister started having severe mental health issues and we ended up with a ton of medical bills. My hours were cut at my job (same with the rest of the staff). I now make less than $3000 a year. I am in graduate school and have to finish an unpaid internship before I can graduate. I love it but it takes a lot of time. I made it through college with very little debt but now I am taking out student loans just to help with my cat/financial situation. I am the first person in my family to go to college. Graduate school is a huge freaking deal to them. I can't quit now when I am so close to being done. I recognize that some of this is just my own pride but I was the kid in town who came from the bad family and I wasn't supposed to amount to anything at all (but that is another story).

Some of the oldest cats that couldn't be caught have had kittens. People keep dropping off cats without even talking to me. Fewer people are willing to take them in. I spend hundreds of dollars every month on food, vet bills, spaying/neutering, shots, flea meds, wormer, etc. I really can't afford it anymore but I do it. I've contacted cat houses, the humane society, and a few other organizations in Nebraska but I can't find any help outside of paying to have them put down or paying $70 a cat to put them in a shelter where they may or may not be put down. The Cat House is full. I do attend an annual spay and neuter clinic but even with the discount, it is expensive. Last month, my bill was about $400 for 5 cats (shots, wormer, 1 spayed, 4 neutered). Furthermore, people in my town have started doing horrible things to animals (not just mine). Animals are being shot, poisoned, tortured, drugged, drowned, and disappearing. I was in the process of building a cat fence before my financial situation fell apart but now I can't afford it. I'm really scared. I have a cat that needs surgery but I can't get it. It isn't a life or death situation but she needs her left eye removed and I just don't have the money. I feel bad.

I regularly donate and help others IRL. When I work, I solicit donations from patrons to help with different causes. I have received some help from people in my community (e.g., bags of cat food, a vet bill paid) but I've run out of people to ask. This is a small town. Those who are willing to help with the cats already have and the rest are not willing. I'm not asking anyone to send me money or anything, I'm just looking for ideas on where to go or resources that I can look into. I did post on a different subreddit today where a person was offering help for people in need of pet food. I will be posting proof later. I'm not sure what all I should provide but I'm planning on posting pics of some of the cats, vet bills, a facebook post where I talked about animals being abused in town, a post offering kittens free to a good home, and a pic of one of my pay stubs. If you want anything else, let me know.

TL;DR I tried to help cats when I was able to do so. I am no longer able to do as much and will be struggling for the next few months. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I will return the favor when I am done with my internship and able to get a better job.

If you want the town that I live in or my phone number or anything, please pm me. I am uncomfortable posting those things.

**PROOF:** I have uploaded some photos of a few of the cats (more to follow because we have a ton now), a few of the vet bills (same), one of my most recent pay stubs, and some old facebook posts about the things being done to pets.
Edit - changed imgur to an album because I missed one person's information on facebook and can't delete the pic. So I made it private and put everything else in a public album - added a fixed version of that picture as well as screenshots of a donation I received today from a redditor who has just blown me away. I cannot thank this person enough.

They can be seen here.

**Edit**
I wanted to give some numbers in terms of how many cats are currently here and how many are feral.

We have 5 feral cats left over from the original colony. These cats have been wormed but not fixed. 4 are females and 1 is male. 

We have 2 black cats that were dropped off and are mostly tame. They act like they really want to be pets. One of the black ones was pregnant when she was dropped off. She has had 3 kittens (the gray, black, and black and white ones in the photos). I am unsure about their vet history. They are not fixed so that is on the agenda. Same with shots and wormer. 

We have 1 male black and white cat that was beaten pretty badly. He is learning to trust people again. He has his shots but isn't fixed. This is on the agenda. 

We have 1 really old yellow tomcat that was left at a house after his owner was placed in a nursing home. Her children don't want him so now he is here. His face is messed up from a dog attack. We've been putting antibiotics on it but need to take him to a vet. 

We have 1 tame cat with a genetic eye problem. She has been fixed and has all shots. No one wants a cat who is going blind. 

We have 1 tame long haired black cat that lived in a meth house. He is fixed and has all of his shots. I'm also trying to find him a home. 

We have 1 Siamese mix. He was found when he was two weeks old and bottle fed. He has a bunch of anxiety problems and has been poisoned in the past. He can't be placed because he is neurotically attached to me. He has his shots and has been fixed. 

We have 1 long hair gray and white cat that was literally stuck to the high way during winter. He has been fixed and has his shots. 

We have 1 short hair siamese looking cat with an eye that needs removed. She came from the cat with the bad eye that was mentioned above. She will also go blind. She has all of her shots and has been fixed. 

We have 2 male tiger striped cats that have seizure disorders. They are fixed and have shots. They also came from a meth house. 

We have 1 big gray cat and 1 big long haired orange cat. They were my first cats. Their mother was hit by a car when they were kittens. The others from the litter died and my professor gave them to me to bottle feed. He was going to put them down. The gray one has rolling back syndrome. 

We also currently have 2 long hair gray/white siamese-ish kittens (6 weeks old and tame), 1 tiger striped/calico male kitten (6 weeks old and tame), 1 yellow male kitten (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black female kitten (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a white tip on his tale (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a calico face (tame and 8 weeks old), 3 tiger striped kittens and 1 yellow kitten that are special needs kittens. They were born in someone's basement and the mother disappeared. They were almost dead when they were brought over. They are being bottle fed at the moment. They will need a lot of attention. I think they are about 5 weeks old. I don't know if anyone will ever take them. All of these kittens need homes."

I've (unfortunantely) not been saving it, as I've poured the $2,300 into things like video games, dinners with gfs, movies, paying for other people, etc... And I've only managed to put $200 into the bank. To me, the biggest problem is that I can't ""see"" this money. When I do intern work and then get paid I can quantify and understand the money I've earned much more easily.
But online, it all goes straight into my PayPal account and then the only thing that sees the money is the cash register that my PayPal debit card goes through :'(.
I want to start saving up money (I'm going to college in a year) and my parents aren't exactly great guides when it comes to being frugal.

So, /r/Frugal , do you have any tips for me in order for me to stash more money away and only spend the money I earn online for ""necessary"" things, and how to ensure that the money goes into my bank in order to pay for my incoming college debt? 

Thanks for any help.

Initially, I was fine with applying to jobs and then milling around the house for the rest of the day, but as the days dragged on, the excessive free time took its toll on me. I want to desperately find things to do to stay busy, but I feel it's not enough; I still spend the majority of my days at time, whether through not having the money to drive around much, or for a lack of anything to do.

-Most of my friends are not in the area anymore. I am in the LA/Orange County area, and everyone that I used to hang out with are either in NorCal or on the East coast. 

-I found an ESL volunteering position that I enjoy, but it is only once per week.

-I got accepted to a hospital internship, but it doesn't start until the end of July / August. Even so, it will probably be around four to twelve hours a week, depending on how many shifts I can sign up for.

-I have a gym membership and I go about two to three times a week.

-I study a little Chinese and Japanese by myself every day.

Even with all these small activities, I still feel very much alone most of my days. I'm normally a very anti-social and inverted person, but even this is getting to be a little too much for me.

hzu0j,0,2011-06-14,Can smoking make you dumber?,JizzBubbles,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hzu0j/can_smoking_make_you_dumber/,"I smoked (weed) for the first time a couple weeks ago, and the following day I literally felt ""dumber"". My mind couldn't process thoughts as efficiently. For example, I remember trying to do a brainteaser and failing to be able to focus in on the problem. It was such a horrible, helpless feeling.

3 days after the incident I could still taste the weed in my mouth (I think I may have swallowed a bit of it). The worst change in me since that smoking, however, was that I lost all motivation and enjoyment of life. Before that incident, I was extremely hyped up and excited because I was looking forward to my upcoming interning in NYC. Well a few days after I smoked, I moved to NYC to start my internship. All of the excitement that I had previously anticipated vanished. For some reason I just don't give a shit anymore. I've been having a very difficult time staying engaged in my work and it's led to subpar performance. I could probably attribute a lot of it to lack of sleep. For example: a lot of times when someone would lecture me on something work-related, I'd have trouble staying awake and focusing, which would thus lead to me simply nodding my head despite not understand anything being told. But I still feel like a part of me has been missing ever since I smoked that weed. All of last year I was never depressed. Now I think I am. 

I know it's strange, but a lot of my happiness is dependent on my motivation and intelligence. Ever since that one smoke, I've lost a great deal of both, and as a result have become depressed. This was supposed to be an awesome summer, now I've set myself up for a depressing one. The turning point was when I smoked. Is it possible for a single joint to chemically alter your brain and make you depressed? Or is there some fundamental underlying problem in me that I'm falsely attributing to the weed?

Yes this is a serious post. I have nothing against smoking (although I'll never do that again). "

So my ex and I broke up in April. The relationship was profoundly important and positive for both of us and it is safe to say that we had deep feelings for one another, resembling love. We began to fight and a lot of times, he wasn't respectful to me in front of others. The relationship wasn't perfect but that's just a reality that everyone faces. He broke things off in April because he was deeply depressed and felt like he couldn't care about me sufficiently because he couldn't care for himself. We had two classes together, our best friends are dating, and we work together. Sufficed to say, avoiding his presence was not an option. Things, of course, continued after we broke up and we still had feelings for one another through the very last day of the semester. He's currently in Japan for an internship and I thought that him being in a foreign country would help me deal with my feelings for him, but that has not proven to be the case. He still contacts me on an almost daily basis and says he misses me but that he still cannot handle a relationship. These are feelings that I am willing to be patient for but my biggest fear is that when I see him again in September, I will have waited and he won't feel the same and I'll have to move on all over again. What should I do? I honestly have no idea how to proceed and it's such a constant presence in my life, to the point where it's making me deeply depressed. Help. "

Right now, I feel like no one wants to hire a kid out of college at any respectable salary, when the last job they worked was for 7.65 an hour. I do not feel like my degree will be respected at all. I feel like college is just pointless for me.

I want to focus on international business. Travel from country to country, speak different languages, and be successful. I feel like Ill just end up being nothing like what I wanted. I dream of studying abroad, and I hope it can happen.

hzq4k,8,2011-06-14,Dating my intern... help!,AltyMcAlterson,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hzq4k/dating_my_intern_help/,"Hey all, really need some advice here.  Ages: 24F (me), 22M.  About a month ago we got a new intern at work.  He and I hit it off immediately; we spent a lot of time talking and chatting over IM, discovering we had mutual interests.  I have always had one ironclad rule for work, and that is:  Never date someone you work with.  I've seen it go wrong so many times.  Well, it's great to have a rule in theory; it can be a lot harder in practice.  I was very attracted to our new intern and I thought he had a great personality, plus we have so many mutual interests and he is great at making me smile.  It was pretty clear he was interested in me too; he spent a lot of time in my office just talking, he would shower me with compliments (""you're awesome"" ""you're so fun"" ""you have a great smile"" etc), he'd wait for me after group meetings so he could walk and talk with me, and so on.  Within about 2 weeks, 3 different co-workers laughingly mentioned my ""new admirer"".  Another co-worker told me this morning that she overheard some people talking about it.  I work at a very small, close-knit site so gossip is rampant about stuff like this.  I tried to avoid showing interest, both to keep down the gossip and also because I was so adamant about not dating a co-worker, but apparently I wasn't wholly successful.

So this past weekend he and I hung out with a group of co-workers.  He ended up walking me home and confessed his feelings, and I told him I felt the same way.

Here's the problem:  At my company (ok, this is probably true at every company) it is DEFINITELY frowned upon to date an intern, as a full-time worker.  It is even frowned upon to date someone you work closely with, when there is no difference in rank/standing.  It's not like we have official company policies that say you can't do it, and it's not like there will even be a note left in my file, but it may leave a bad impression on those I work with.  On the bright side, I have nothing to do with the work assignments he's been given.  On the down side, he therefore has no reason to be in my office as much as he is so it looks very suspicious.

To complicate things, there are two people in my office - both of whom have offices just down the hall from me - who started dating about a year ago.  They attempted to keep it quiet at first but eventually got called out.  They endured a substantial amount of gossip, teasing, and general grief for it, but never any ""official"" problems (that I'm aware of).  However, right now they are going through a messy break-up and the drama has started to spill into work hours.  It's a nervewracking reminder of what could happen to me, if I'm not careful.

So, I have a bunch of questions:

- Should I be dating my intern?  Yes, he's younger than me; yes, I'm out of college while he is still in college and will need to return for one more year. (this is my friends' biggest argument against it)  I don't think there is a huge difference in maturity levels.

- What should I expect from this relationship, knowing he has to go back to school (halfway across the country) in 3 months?  I don't know if I necessarily need advice on this, as much as I need to wrap my head around the idea that if things go really really well, I may be getting myself into an LDR.  It's pretty clear that he is very interested in me and he's made it perfectly clear he wants to truly date - not just mess around.

- Should we attempt to hide this relationship from co-workers?  It's not going to be easy if we do.  Already there's been enough gossip that people are sensitive when they see us together.

- Should I mention anything to HR?  I realize that if things explode in my face, I want to make sure I keep HR informed, but it's very tempting to try to hide the whole thing altogether.

Thanks in advance for any help!"
hzngv,5,2011-06-14,Information on getting internships at the Big4 as an junior undergraduate (a Q&amp;A session with Potatogun),spacekillers,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/hzngv/information_on_getting_internships_at_the_big4_as/,"Below are some questions that I asked Potatogun and he was kind enough to reply back with detailed responses. If you are looking for internships at the Big4, I'm sure you'll find this information useful. 
All credits to Potatogun, he is an awesome guy!! 

Consider reading the [Big4 AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/glvzt/big_4_public_accounting_ama_qa_through_the_weekend/) for more information about the Big4. 


Question 1:

I will be a junior next year and will be taking intermediate accounting during the Fall semester (which is when I'm be applying). Is it common for juniors to get Big4 internships? B/c I heard from someone that you usually work for a mid-tier firm your junior yr, then a big4 in your senior year because Big4 wants to see accounting experience.

&gt;In the US if you aren't in a specific masters program (5 year), then during the 3rd year is normally when you apply for Big4 internships. The internship being the summer before your 4th year.
&gt;It is unnecessary to have prior accounting experience to land a Big4 internship. Rather you need the grades, and whatever varied life experiences and/or involvement. That could mean leadership, volunteering, part time work help pay the bills, or even sports/music hobbies that you're really involved in. It also is very dependent on your networking, because honestly internships are the hardest thing to land (compared to full time hiring). Big4 now probably source about 60-80% of their full time start classes via the internships. That means that these are the very best candidates in the eyes of the firm.

Question 2: 

Do you mind describing what interns do on a daily bases during the summer term? If I got an internship in assurance/audit, what would I be doing?

&gt;Interns usually have a couple weeks of training to introduce them to whatever audit/tax/advisory work they are going to be working in. Generally the idea is to expose you to as much client service work as possible. Time at the client site or client-facing roles will obviously differ from audit to tax to advisory.
&gt;You generally will help an engagement team by doing all sorts of misc tasks. This can range from help organizing data, copying, picking up food, 'rolling' forward documentation for the next review or audit or helping do some basic test work. This might not sound very exciting, and honestly the actual work part might not be, but you will feel the stress of wanting to do the best you can to make the best impression on your team. So it's your own little set of challenges. Talking to a client seems incredibly daunting of a task. It can be even as a first year starting out (okay, it definitely is at times). Even as an intern you will most likely feel out of your comfort zone. That's a good thing.

Question 3:

I know there are 2 interviews, the on-campus and the office. To get the on-campus interview, it's all based on how well the interviewers knows you and your resume. Do you remember how the interview goes? Is it like: I sit down, and the interviewer starts asking questions after question, then after he is finished, I walk out and calls on the next guy? Is the interview very structured or friendly conversation-like? Do you have any tips on how to do well on the interviews, specifically the behavior questions?

&gt;The interview process is generally what you mentioned. One on campus and 'one' in office. The in office may be multiple interviews but back to that in a bit. For on campus, it generally means you've gotten this interview because you meet the basic grade/experiences (remember not necessarily WORK experience) requirements and have probably networked a bit. If you are not the most stellar candidate then the networking plays a huge role in getting an interview. You want to interact with as many professionals you can where you can establish relationships. This doesn't just mean talking to EVERY single person. You want each person to remember a bit about you. Aside from the generic work questions, please don't start asking about accounting topics. Be a person. Talk about social life or activities out of work that might pique the interest of the professionals you're talking to. We take notes and compile them on candidates, but try to just keep it as conversation; professional with some slight touch of humor.
&gt;The on-campus interview interview is probably 30m with 1 or 2 people. Probably a Manager, sometimes a Partner or even recruiter if things are short staffed. Generally these questions are behavioral and more specific to your resume. Know what you have on your resume; be able to talk about whatever you've mentioned in any writing. I would say the structure depends on the person. However, it is generally more structured than an office interview with a partner. You will likely have a greeter who is an associate. They are there to break the ice. When you meet your interviewer, have a firm handshake and look them in the eye (or at their nose). Be confident but not arrogant. If at any point you are tripped up on a question just ask to think about it a moment. Do some research about your office location of interest. What's the industry there? What are some major clients? How big is the office? Know some about the firms' community service focus or programs such as sending people abroad. Show interest in how the firm develops its people and gives back to the community, etc.
&gt;The general advice I can give about behavioral questions is to think about all the scenarios you've been tired, worked hard, and accomplished something. Be very self reflective because there are probably a lot of things you don't think are impressive at all. They can be examples from school, to family, to work, to self projects. You always want to try to convey that you can be responsible, take charge, be a team player, be communicative, caring, innovative, and willing to push yourself and better yourself. Because remember the goal of the behavioral questions are to find if you fit the qualities of person who can work hard and long hours being an associate at a Big4 firm. If your time goes over the allotment or you go on a stretch one a single topic that you and your interviewer are passionate about, then you know things are going well.
&gt;When your interview ends, reiterate your interest in the internship and the firm after having spoken to the interviewer.


Question 4:

Is the office interview still all behavior questions? Is it round-robin style where you interview with the managers and HR people? I heard from people that the office interview is just to see if you have a good personality and are nice and not about your GPA/resume stats. So should my main goal be: smiling, be friendly, and just have a good time?


&gt;The office interviews are more like a day or two program/event. They generally have you stay the night before so you can go out to dinner with some fellow interviewees and some professionals. This helps ease you in and break the ice. You will likely have presentations and some group discussion/Q&amp;A with other students interviewing. Then you will probably interview with 2-3 people. At least a partner and probably a Sr. Manager or two. These are much more like conversations. But they are really behavioral in how you act and respond. You want to be calm, friendly, and likable. Get the person to talk about herself. Career, family, interests, travel experiences, etc. Try to find some common ground.
&gt;I highly doubt you'd interview with HR. Generally this isn't the process for college recruits. That might be more for experienced people trying to negotiate.
&gt;After all interviews send thank you emails.

Coming out was the beginning to the best part of my life.  I am now successful and happy with who I am and where I am going.  Thanks Reddit for keepin' on the lgbt positive and giving me the motivation to keep on keepin' on :)

TL;DR: Came out, went out on my own, graduated and got my dream job. "

hzk17,2,2011-06-14,"Reddit, have you ever had to give up a pet?",nekoshii,Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/hzk17/reddit_have_you_ever_had_to_give_up_a_pet/,"Hey Reddit,

So a little background:  I have a parrotlet named Cielo and I've had him since he was 5 weeks old.  He's 11 months old now, and recently started talking and can say, ""Kisses!"", ""Step up!"", and ""Hey, bird!"".

It goes without saying that we share a special bond;  I love my little guy!

The trouble is, however, I'm a recent college graduate.  I haven't been able to find any jobs or internships in the area and plan on moving wherever I find one.  It'd be difficult to take little Cielo with me because it's at least $100 to fly him with me one way, don't have a car, and plan on moving wherever I can find a job.  And there, the worry is whether I can find a place that would allow pets.

Having him during the year was a bit difficult, too, and I often gave up precious study time to come home and take him out of the cage to play.

I feel like at this life stage, I'm not exactly ready to have a pet.  I feel that I *should* give him to a family so that he could have a more stable life (not that I don't take great care of him!) and also 

But at the same time, I feel that I know him best and would love him best (cliche, I know).  He's also bonded to me, so I'm wondering how it would affect him.

In an ideal situation, I could find a fellow bird-lover who's experienced with parrots and is willing to take another bird under his wing.  So far, I've had no luck finding anyone :(

So what should I do, Reddit?  To be completely honest, I don't feel as though I have the time to devote to a pet and would love to find him a happy new home.  I think I'd just have trouble letting go and believing that others would take care of him as well as I did.

What's your opinion of the situation?  Have you ever had any similar experiences?


**TL;DR - Life circumstances are giving me doubts about my ability to keep my bird.  What should I do?  What are your opinions/experiences?**


Here are some photos of my little guy!  I just can't resist showing him off :)

hzdbf,0,2011-06-14,I'm Marrying My High School Sweetheart and This is Our Story,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/hzdbf/im_marrying_my_high_school_sweetheart_and_this_is/,"I'm getting married to my high school sweetheart this Saturday. We did not write our own vows and I'm not really the type to put my emotions in words or really speak them for that matter but this morning I started to think about our long journey. I thought getting it out in writing would help me remember it better and figured I would share it with you guys.

WALL OF TEXT

The first time I noticed you was in a class we had together our junior year . You were sitting there leaning on the desk not really paying attention and you seemed like you were deep in thought. I knew who you were because we had been in the same grade since middle school but I never really noticed you until that day. I could stop thinking about you and talked to my best friend how hot I thought you were and he took that as a challenge. He gave you my number in home room and you gave him your number for me. He told you to call me but you told him if I wanted to talk to you I would have to call you. I never ended up calling you but we did meet in the hall way before our respective sports practices. Over the next few days we talked to each other in the hall and that weekend I asked you on our first date. We saw a movie and got a drink at the fast food restaurant next door afterward. I was so nervous when I paid that I accidentally ripped the money in half before paying. You traded me the ripped money for a fresh bill. I was nervous and didn’t make a lot of eye contact but we sat and talked about whatever for a while and we parted ways. Over the next few weeks we started to hang out more, mostly watching movies and either of our parent’s houses. We had live less than ten minutes apart from each other most of our lives but never knew it. This made seeing each other much easier.  I eventually “officially“ asked you out and that began the real start to our relationship and ultimately our friendship. We spent the next year enjoying our senior year together and you were there for my victories and loses. We graduated that year. You were heading off to a local private college to study to be a nurse and I had gotten a job as an apprentice electrician with a local company. We tried to spend as much time together but college takes up a lot of time and some days I would just go to sleep early out of exhaustion but we made it work. I eventually decided I wanted to go to college and you supported me in my decision. I chose a local college that one of my high school buddies was attending so we would still be close to each other. I finally got an apartment with a few roommates and we were able to spend much more quality time together, well as alone as you could be with roommates. You cooked me meals and you helped me with the shopping and my laundry.  The next year we moved into a duplex and you live in the top apartment and I lived in the bottom. This way we appeased our parents but it gave us the chance to sort of live together. I was able to get an internship with a great company and started with them full time after I graduated. I vividly remember when they called me in to tell me they wanted to hire me full time. As soon as they told be the first thing that came to my mind was that I wanted to marry you. On the way home I stopped at Meijer’s and picked out the largest gaudiest fake ring I could find. That day in the car to your parents you kept pestering me about how it went at work and I couldn’t tell you because I wanted to surprise you.  While I was fixing your parents computer, you went into your room to get something.  I told you I had a surprise for you and told you to come over and close your eyes. My heart was going a mile a minute and in one breath without pauses I told you about the job and asked you to marry me. At first you thought I was kidding but then realized I wasn’t. We both had moved in with our parents to save money and you had one more year of school left. It was a tough year going from being able to spend so much time alone to have to be together with our parents but we made it though. We moved into an apartment together this past weekend and you are going to finally move in after we get married Saturday. Over the last six and a half years we have had good times and bad, we have lived, love, laughed, learned and grows together. I can’t imagine a life without you by my side and could not think of anyone I would rather grow old with. You were my first for, well everything and now you are just my everything and I can’t wait for this Saturday to start the next chapter in our lives together.


;TLDR  Pick them  young and grow them the way you want

My boyfriend and I met in highschool, we were friends for a long time. Senior year, we started dating, we fell in love very quickly and very hard. His family loves me, and my family loves him. I am good friends with his sister and he is my best friend. I enjoy spending time with him. I just have so many doubts. Immediately before we were dating, I was in a 2 year relationship. I feel as though I've living my entire adult life with a constant companion. There is nothing wrong with this, but I am yearning to be free. My insecurities about never having experienced independence are affecting our relationship strongly. I am argumentative, I have been interested in other people (not emotionally, just from afar) and I am less sexually attracted to him. We were regularly having sex about once every 2 weeks. Whenever we do have sex, it is very very good, but it is infrequent. I used to love the way he smelled, but now I try to avoid his breath. He doesn't have halitosis or anything, it's just I don't like his smell. We talked about all of this about 2 months ago and I came very close to breaking up with him, but he convinced me to try to work things out, and I have been trying hard. It is my dream things would work out, but it feels like that can't happen....idk

He recently started an internship for 3 months over 1000 miles away. I will only see him once this summer, in about 3 weeks. I was using this period of living alone as a trial run for experiencing independence, but it isn't enough. I feel like being single is essential to understanding a level about myself that I haven't ever seen before. I don't know how to put it in less abstract terms, I just feel like i need to ""find myself"". He says that he isn't hindering me from finding myself, but I really feel that him being away from me would aide in him finding himself as well! He just doesn't know what he's missing. If I don't feel better about things before I see him in 3 weeks, I will likely break up with him. I suppose my questions are: first off, should I break up with him? should I break up with him when I visit him in 3 weeks (I already have plane tickets, and we're visiting at his grandmother's home, with all of his family there), or should I visit him, have a good final goodbye then call him and break up with him afterwards?

After both having lived in Austin, TX and attended the University of Texas (Hook 'Em!), my cousin went on to serve in the military, and I stuck around Austin.

Given the rarity with which we now see one another as well as our fondness for 6th street, the bars we used to frequent in our college days, and just alcohol in general, we decide to go out as soon as he gets to town. It was a Wednesday (I think).

Fast forward about 12 hours. As I gradually emerge from slumber, I am overcome with a desire to spew instantly but manage to keep myself from doing so. As I continue to regain consciousness and greater awareness of my being, I also begin to notice things like moderate back pain and a large cut on my hand. After I rub my eyes to remove gunky build up, a quick look around reveals that, in what must have been a drunken stupor, I had decided to crawl up on to my kitchen counter and pass out (for the life of me, I still don't know why . . . know one else was in my apartment, and I had two vacant beds). Exhausted and in pain, I decide to roll to my left and reposition myself on my side in an attempt alleviate some of the back pain that must have been/is being caused by sleeping on a granite countertop. As I do so, the oven clock comes into view. It's 10:30 am. wtfuck

To this point, I had been relatively calm. Sure, I am hungover as fuck, have a huge cut on my hand that I can't explain, and for some reason I am sleeping on my kitchen counter, but that's pretty routine for a weekend in the ATX (once again, Hook 'Em!) . . .but not for a Thursday morning on which I am supposed to report on the state of my section to the managing partners/my employer.

Crisis mode:engage.

Brain activity instantaneously goes through the roof. I sprint to my room and grab my phone. I dial one of our office interns. As collectedly as able, I ask him to let everyone know that I am running a bit behind for the meeting and that I would appreciate if he could make and distribute copies of the materials I had prepared , then I strip off my clothes and hop into the shower. For anyone wondering, it is in fact possible to soap, shampoo, brush your teeth, and rinse all of the above in under 30 seconds if you are okay with missing a few spots.

After I hastily semi-dry myself, I proceed to the closet to pick out some clothes. As I try to decide what to throw on, my mind is also racing trying to figure out what sort of explanation I am going to give as to my tardiness. Bingo. Got 'em coach.

When I arrive at the entrance of the office, I take a deep breath and put on a California afternoon smile. As I breach the main entrance, I walk deliberately slow, flashing the smile and (exceedingly) happily greeting everyone that I encounter en route to my office, doing my best to display a non-typical casualness and disconnect from work matters while sporting my finest power suit. Clearly I had just come from some non-work related activity - perhaps talking to a classroom or some junk. Truthfully, my brain with a hangover is bad about details. I didn't really know from where this character had just come, but I knew a suit would say that it was important and that perhaps I am justified in being late.

When I reach my office, I decide to let word of my arrival circulate the office on its own rather than calling to let anyone I am now available to proceed with the meeting. A few minutes later, the phone rings - caller ID tells me it is the big boss. Before I answer, I give myself a 5 second mental pep-talk and tell myself to stay the course.

I will interject with a little back story: Our core business was breaking even at the time. We had recently gotten into a new area of business conducting what I will simply refer to as ""projects"" that was highly profitable and growing. We had just secured a new multi-million dollar project (very big deal for our relatively small company), and I was essentially project management. I was supposed to be detailing procedures, timelines for deliverables, staffing needs, etc in the meeting that morning. Now back to the story.

I answer the phone and greet the BB as chipper as I had everyone else. I make no mention of the tardiness he was likely waiting for me to explain. Eventually, he asks me directly how I could have been late for the meeting. In a carefree and upbeat tone, I apologize and tell him that I had an important meeting that ran late that morning. He didn't say anything for what seems like an eternity.

At this point, I expect him to raise his tone a bit and tell me to get to the main conference room immediately. He doesn't. Instead, he very coldly tells me to be in his office in 30 minutes. Curve ball.

Instead of game planning, I sit in my office drinking water and trying not to throw up. 30 minutes simultaneously fly by and seem to last forever, and I make my way over.

When I get to the BB's office, I am surprised and disturbed to see a senior HR staff member there along with all the managing partners that work in Austin/that office. I freak out a bit on the inside, but it's too late to turn back now. I decide the smile stays.

I walk into the office and greet everyone warmly, then I have a seat. Someone gets up and closes the door behind me. I notice the person from HR has a notepad and no one else is holding anything. A little piece of me dies.

The BB asks me why I was so late to such an important meeting, to which I respond along the lines of ""Yes, I'm very sorry. I had an important meeting this morning that ran quite a bit longer than expected."" Next, he asks ""An important meeting . . .?"" Being hungover, my brain decides to suck and I can't think of a feasible meeting type, so I go with another response that is vague and doesn't really respond to the question he had implied. ""Yes, it was probably poor decision making to schedule it on the same day. I won't make such a mistake in the future."" I smile and hope we are done here.

The partners all look at each other as I sit in awkward silence. My BB responds with something like ""We are on the eve of starting this company's largest project to date, and you are out interviewing for other jobs!""

I'm caught totally off-guard and stopped dead in my tracks. Deer in the headlights.

I sit quietly for a moment. I start to see the bigger picture. As I previously explained, the projects were not a part of our core business, and as such, the partners were not experienced our knowledgeable as to the details of their operation. Given the size of the company, redundancy was rare, and I was essentially the only one that knew operations/process inside and out, and for that matter, the only one that knew the specific progress, plans, etc for existing projects. Given my tardiness, the suit, and my referring to an ""important meeting"" as causing my tardiness, they have all reasoned that I was at a job interview. And given the bigger upcoming project, growth in demand for the projects in general, and my mini-monopoly on some of the information, they all seem to be on tilt.

I decide to take it in stride and go with it, as I have no other better explanation. I try to downplay it and diffuse the while situation by responding ""I am not actively looking for other employment or anything like that - if I was I would tell you. I simply like to know what my options are and what my services elsewhere are worth. I've been on other interviews while working here, and no one has taken exception to it before. Back in my school days, I was taught to always know your options and to know what you are worth.""

My BB turns red (yes, he is one of those) and erupts. ""Do you think you can angle for raise right before we start this project"" yadda yadda yadda or something like that. Hungover me didn't understand how he had brought about such a response, but sober me gets it in retrospect.

This continues for some time. I try to play it cool and give collected, non threatening responses, but I think that just made the guy even more angry, like I wouldn't fess-up or like I was so calm because I knew I had him by the balls. Really, I was nervous as shit. I was thinking:

   1. Man, I need to hurl.
   2. It's hot in here with this jacket and tie.
   3. Fuck, I might get fired
   4. Hmmm, no one has noticed the huge cut on my hand or that it has started to bleed.

After he's done talking at me, he sends me away and tells me to get back to work. I'm worried by the fact that we are not having the meeting.

I sit in my office for the next couple of hours thinking over the whole situation. I am FUCKED. As I sit there thinking (Hmmm, my resume needs to be updated, and my friend mentioned that his company was hiring. Damn it, I'm going to punch my cousin.), the HR rep calls me and asks me to come to her office. Sigh, I didn't really like the job or the company that much anyways, not the end of the world. I take a moment, and when I am ready for it, I head over.

I sit down. She gets up and closes the door. If history is an indicator, that wasn't a good sign.

She begins to speak; ""GarrettGilberPass, BB and the other partners are not pleased that you are out interviewing for other jobs."" I think to myself, here it comes. ""We are prepared to offer you a raise to your annual salary in the amount of $XX,XXX if you sign a new employment agreement for 2 years, in which you are required to obtain approval before interviewing with other organizations"". Best wtf moment ever.

SOOO, I guess I got a raise?

**tl;dr:**

   1. Drank like a fish
   2. Woke up late and threw on a suit
   3. Showed up late for work when I had an important meeting
   4. said I was late because I had a different ""important meeting""
   5. got a raise

Also, granite countertops apparently look more comfortable than pillow-top mattresses when you are piss-drunk.

hyzjv,7,2011-06-13,"Comp for my Bro, could really use some help.",EMTsNightmare,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/hyzjv/comp_for_my_bro_could_really_use_some_help/,"My brother, who is currently going to grad school for Architecture, has finally had his 6-year-old MacBook Pro crap out on him.  Since his grad school and summer internship both use PC's, he's looking to get a new PC.  He's got a $1500 budget, and while he would prefer a laptop (for the mobility) he'd also go with a desktop if it provided enough benefits.  The catch is that the desktop would have to include a monitor, keyboard, and Windows 7 in the price.

The primary use of the PC will be to run AutoCAD, 3DMax and other graphic programs, not games.  Though I'm sure he'll play some, it should not be a priority for the build.

The catch is, that he's in California, I'm on the East Coast, and he doesn't know how to build a PC (having had a mac for years....).  So ideally I'm looking for a laptop or desktop that's either completely assembled or mostly assembled and he can figure out on his own how to get it finalized.

I'm stuck and don't really know where to start, or where to focus my attention since I've mostly focused on gaming rigs.  Anyone have any ideas?  Thanks!"
hyzbi,0,2011-06-13,I am a twenty year old who just got braces. They are really painful and I feel really depressed about my appearance. Will they affect me chances of getting a job from an interview?,Dental-plan-man,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hyzbi/i_am_a_twenty_year_old_who_just_got_braces_they/,"Someone cheer me up please?

I got braces when I was younger; unfortunately the retainer was fitted incorrectly and my teeth went completely back to their normal state with wisdom teeth and some other complications.

Because of this, I have had to get braces again. I just started two new jobs programming, and I've overheard new co-workers comment on how ridiculous I look already. I'm fighting with my girlfriend of 4 years and it's compounded by the braces, I am working 12 hours a day and have no time to do anything I enjoy...I feel a little bit lost right now, and it's all being compounded by these gargantuan hunks of metal on my face, that are keeping me from my beloved comfort eating.

Is it worth it? I am considering just having them removed, they hurt to much to deal with right now, and the orthodontist left the little metal bit that digs into your skin sticking out the side and I cannot go to get this fixed for five weeks...I think I will just get them removed and examine my situation from there.

As part of my college course we do an internship also, will having braces affect how I am seen by my interviewers? I have already noticed people being more condescending/assuming I am younger than I am."

After both having lived in Austin, TX and attended the University of Texas (Hook 'Em!), my cousin went on to serve in the military, and I stuck around Austin.

Given the rarity with which we now see one another as well as our fondness for 6th street, the bars we used to frequent in our college days, and just alcohol in general, we decide to go out as soon as he gets to town. It was a Wednesday (I think).

Fast forward about 12 hours. As I gradually emerge from slumber, I am overcome with a desire to spew instantly but manage to keep myself from doing so. As I continue to regain consciousness and greater awareness of my being, I also begin to notice things like moderate back pain and a large cut on my hand. After I rub my eyes to remove gunky build up, a quick look around reveals that, in what must have been a drunken stupor, I had decided to crawl up on to my kitchen counter and pass out (for the life of me, I still don't know why . . . know one else was in my apartment, and I had two vacant beds). Exhausted and in pain, I decide to roll to my left and reposition myself on my side in an attempt alleviate some of the back pain that must have been/is being caused by sleeping on a granite countertop. As I do so, the oven clock comes into view. It's 10:30 am. wtfuck

To this point, I had been relatively calm. Sure, I am hungover as fuck, have a huge cut on my hand that I can't explain, and for some reason I am sleeping on my kitchen counter, but that's pretty routine for a weekend in the ATX (once again, Hook 'Em!) . . .but not for a Thursday morning on which I am supposed to report on the state of my section to the managing partners/my employer.

I'm a developer intern working on a C++ program which uses the JUCE libraries for GUI. I've just installed the ndk, and have cygwin updating (yuck... this is taking forever) so i have awk, make and all that.

But beyond the basic ""set up the ndk questions"" which I'm sure I'll have more questions about in the future as I'm sure to come into problems I have a more pressing questions.

Has anyone here used JUCE in Android? It's supposed to work with it. Right now all our GUI is defined using JUCE. The company seems interested in creating mobile applications of the product but it almost seems as if we'll have to start from the ground up because much of the program is GUI driven.

I was a youth minister intern in my early college years, but I de-converted during my sophomore year of college.
My research interest are in three main areas: Faith Based Initiatives, tax policy towards religious institutions, and instruction on religion in public schools (as opposed to religious instruction). The latter is a policy idea proposed by Daniel Dennett. 

I am very careful to not allow my atheism to influence my academic research. However, there simply isn't that much funding for people studying religion in the public policy field. I find it important enough, however, to pursue it even though it is very difficult to find funding. 

So my request is this: does anybody know of good sources of funding that I might look into that are specifically focused on religious policy?

I'll be glad to send my resume or my stated research goals, just PM me.

EDIT: Thanks everybody, these are some really good ideas. I've got a lot of work ahead of me to follow through with all of them. Thanks for all your help, and if you ever run across somebody that is influential enough to help, please send them my way. "

I'm at uni and have a summer internship, so this is my first time to really start dressing well on a day-to-day basis. Just wanted to ask for your thoughts on some of these outfits:
(Sorry about the quality)


[First](http://i.imgur.com/JXR13.jpg): Casual friday outfit. Jeans and polo


[Second](http://i.imgur.com/5ZJdF.jpg): Less casual polo outfit. (I know I need to button the collar- I did for work, but just forgot for the pic)


[Third](http://i.imgur.com/I9Zhv.jpg): Business Casual button up.The shirt is a little large and I need to get it tailored, but I'm not 100% all the things that need to be done. (which brings us to...)



Fourth: I had this other shirt that I took to get tailored. It fit terribly before but I'm pretty sure it's still not great now:
[Front, untucked](http://i.imgur.com/zVJ1hh.jpg), [Side, untucked](http://i.imgur.com/Dejz2.jpg), [Front, tucked](http://i.imgur.com/sFq6T.jpg), [Side, tucked](http://i.imgur.com/kzxHO.jpg), [Back, tucked](http://i.imgur.com/4xnWh.jpg).

The album is [here](http://imgur.com/a/9d574).

I'd like some tips on how to better tailor the other shirt. Should I even consider the using the same tailor? Also it was more of an alterations place- should I be looking for an actual tailor that makes shirts and fixes them or would a clothes-modifications place work well enonugh?"

Calling the various cable / utility companies and closing out accounts.

This was something like a 30 minute conversation with FPL(Florida Power and Light)This is what i remember from the call:

Me: Hi, I am moving on June 20 and i would like to close out my account on that day.  

FPL Guy # 1: OK, what is your address?

Me: 318 S DERP Ave, Sanford Florida.  Apartment #3

FPL Guy # 1: OK, and how would you like the final bill sent to you?

Me: Just send it in an email like you always do.  I am driving 1000 miles with a U-Haul on Monday and Tuesday and don't have a lease signed anywhere yet.  

FPL Guy # 1: Ya, see, I can't do that.  The final bill has to be paper.

Me: Well I am not gonna have an address.  I just explained that to you.  

FPL Guy # 1: OK, what is your cell phone number?

Me: I have a company IPhone that i will be losing in two days since I am leaving the company.  Hence the move.

FPL Guy # 1: Do you have a home phone?

Me: Who the fuck still has a home phone?  And besides i am MOVING anyway.  What good would a home phone at an old apartment do you?

FPL Guy # 1:Well, your final bill needs to be a paper copy.  It's against company policy to delivery these final bills to your email.

Me:  Dude, put your manager on the phone.  

AFTER A 10 MINUTE HOLD TIME

FPL Guy # 2: Hello sir, thank you for waiting.  Unfortunately it is against company policy to send the final bill through email.  It has to be sent through regular mail.  

*REHASH OF THE PREVIOUS 10 MINUTE CONVERSATION*

Me:  OK listen.  No, shut up and listen to me.  Don't talk until I am done.  You, as the manager that i asked to speak to, is willingly and with full knowledge of your actions, forcing a situation in which I CANNOT pay my bill.  Therefore, you are forcing your company into negative financial returns on a current investment.  This is unwise.  I don't want the credit hit and you want your people to pay.  So i have a compromise.  Take the PAPER bill, take 30 seconds and scan it into a PDF or a JPG or something.  Then email me THAT.  Everybody wins.

FPL Guy # 2: We do not have a team of people that are able to do that.

Me: Dude, you could get a high school intern to do it in 30 seconds.  You are Florida Power and Light!  You are run by the government!  You have to have a scanner and someone within the state that has their GED!  Send me a FUCKING EMAIL!

FPL Guy # 2: Unfortunately sir, we cannot send an email.  The bill has to be paper.

Me: OMFG dude, are you really that dumb?  OK, I tell you what.  Send it to me old address, which DOESN'T get paper mail anyway since the mailmen refuse to deliver it, then it will sit at the Sanford post office for 30 days then get BURNED.  THIS is the reaction to you lack of compliance.

GOODBYE!

I do try to keep myself busy just to ignore it, exercising when I'm free or play online games but the loneliness feeling just demotivates me.

I have a late 90's Raleigh R700 Competition with Shimano Ultegras that I started riding this past April. Before my summer job I was riding 5 days a week, about 25 miles each day with a long 60 miler on the weekend. Average speed I would say was 17mph.

I am currently working 60 hours a week (plus 20 hours of driving a week) as a Field Engineer Intern. This has severely crippled my time I have to ride. I have from 6:30-8pm M-F, 4:30-8pm Sat, all day Sun free.

There is a cycling event at my college very similar to IUs little 500. It is in April. Teams of 4 ride a single fixed gear bike around a 1/4 mile track for 40 miles, trading off when need be. Time trail speeds for 1/2 a mile are around 1:05 (~27 mph) and near the end of the race are about 1:20 (~23 mph). Normal strategy for most teams is to switch riders every 2 laps.

I would like to train for this event on my relatively little time schedule. I can go back to training 6 days a week in August. I really know nothing in terms of training for cycling. I do know that since these are fixed gear bikes that building a powerful high cadence is important. 

Most of my friends that have done the little 500 have told me to build up my hours on the bike in the fall (I would like to be up to at least 10 hours a week), then start working on intervals / cadence in the winter / spring (I have rollers it the weather is bad / under 35*F).

Any ideas on a good 6 day a week schedule?

Any ideas on a good 4 day a week schedule for my current time constraint? I am thinking: || Wed: medium intensity 1 hour || Fri: intervals / hills 1 hour || Sun: long ride 4 hours || Mon: recovery ride 1 hour

I feel that my parents are in a loveless or depressed relationship.Their unhappiness can be felt overbearingly. I came home this summer to camp out at the house for an internship that happens to be close by. Initially, everything seems happy upfront, but gradually I felt that they are not happy with their lives...

A few observation:

-During the night, they barely interact with each other. With one either watching TV and the other playing computer games. 

-Their communication usually consist of ""what needs to be done.""

-They complain to me about each other on numerous occasions. 

-They rarely ever smile. 

Now here's the ugly part. My father doesn't have a job, he's been out for almost 2 years now, he does some counseling work part-time (generally about a couple session a week). I've observed the majority of time he watches TV and play computer games. He hasn't been interested in taking much responsibilities and does not like to make decisions. He also has a tendency to cave to avoid conflicts in all costs. His outlook in life has become more cynical over the years. He is 53.

He used to be such a pleasant fellow and very encouraging. This isn't like what he used to be at all.

My mother on the other hand is very goal driven. She is your exact definition of type A personality. She feels like she needs to take charge in almost everything. She is stressed out a lot. Currently, she is the bread winner of the house. She is 52.

They've been married for 12 years and both have been divorced before. 

Now as you can see the dynamics are pretty awkward. My mother would push, push, push and my father would just retreat, retreat, retreat. It just isn't going anywhere and it is really painful to watch. My gut tells me that they are very frustrated with each other. If things continue the way it is, I predict that things are going to end up pretty ugly. 

As a son, I don't want to over step my bounds and neither of my parents takes criticisms very well. Reddit, can you help me or give me an idea on how to approach this? I love my parents very much and I really want to help them live a happier life. 

TL:DR - Parents in a loveless marriage, would like advice on how to help them as a son. "

As the title says, I'm a recent Graphic Design graduate. I majored in Motion Graphics, and am looking to segue back into print graphics or illustration. As far as illustration goes, I tend to have a colorful, fun, cartoonish vector characteristic. But, I can achieve many different styles. I can do a variety of graphic design work including logo design, brochures, flyers, posters, mailers, business cards, you name it I will do it.

Most of my past work involved motion graphics, filming, and newscast work so I'm working on fleshing out a more professional print/illustration portfolio.

I've been between schools, unemployed and trying to find money for more schooling.  But now I just got an offer for a real job that will give me experience that is more valuable than school.  Now I will go off to work hard and earn more money than I thought was previously possible.

I did it by volunteering.  The people I met at my volunteer place acted as my references, resume coaches, and teachers, and I believe were a significant factor in why I got this job.  There were also other factors, but all my recent activities were involving volunteer work.

So if you're unemployed, and you're looking for work, I STRONGLY suggest that you go find a nonprofit worth supporting, and volunteer there.  

* It gets your unemployed ass out of the house and meeting people, making connections, and building up good will.  If you are dealing with constant rejection from jobs, having a place to volunteer is truly good for the spirit.  they will be happy to see you show up every day.  It is too easy to fall into a rut and get depressed when you have nothing to do all day, and this brings you out of it.
* Those people can help get you a job- even if not directly, they can provide references and advice
* It lessens the impact of ""gaps of time"" on your resume, and you can put the experience on there as well.
* Volunteering is generally low-pressure work that isn't too demanding, so all but the most busy of unemployed people(?) have the time to spare.  personally, i spent about 5 hours a week volunteering.
* If you are doing it right, volunteering is FUN and engaging.
* volunteer positions are not competitive, and are just as easy to put on your resume as those ""unpaid internships"", only you will probably never get rejected from applying to a volunteer position.


I might be walking on cloud 9 right now with my recent job acceptance, but there was a long period of time where I just felt totally doomed to a life of minimum wage part time jobs.  the volunteer work was the highlight of my weeks back then, and it opened my eyes to a seriously huge amount of opportunities and information.

I never had an accounting internship due in part to being told from a professor they weren't hiring juniors when I was a junior and then when being senior, I had never had one and thus fell in the same ranks as the then juniors (that and not have an outstanding accounting GPA)... Also, partly because I didn't fully understand the recruiting process and jumped in the game too late. I told myself this was fine, after all,I had planned on going for my masters in accountancy the next year. However, I didn't. I still might, but I'm still trying to figure out where to go from here.
With that said, until I figure out if I need/want a masters (to become a CPA) what avenues should I be taking to find firms to do entry level work with my bachelors? And how do I get in with firms that are explicitly hiring? Are they worth looking into?
Thanks for the help!"

Our relationship started as friends, who would be crazy to im/chat/text all the time, until the wee hours in the morning- sometimes we stayed up till 6am just having amazing conversations.
Once we became gf/bf the texting and chatting has dwindled because we do gf/bf stuff in person now. Recently, I moved to NY for a summer internship but the text/chatting is still sparse. We text a few times (2-3) and chat a bit at night and I still feel loved during those times...but sometimes at work my texts go unanswered for a few hours while I sit at my desk feeling antsy. Those times, I miss the feeling of coming back to my phone with constant silly updates like ""i just ate the best sandwich ever"" or ""hey get online so i can talk to you!"" or ""hey what are you doing?""  waiting to be read. Am I being clingy for wanting the constant text/chatting even if I know he still loves me?

TL,DR: Used to text all the time and now I miss it. I know he still loves me and misses me but sometimes I feel sad when he doesn't text. Am I being clingy if I really miss having the ""new txt msg"" pop up 30 minutes like it used to? Would a guy think its annoying if I asked to ramp up the texting?"

Not a single question was asked during the course of the interview.  Instead the interviewer chose to talk about vacation and summer and small talk kind of things.  At the end of the interview, my fiancee asked her list of prepared questions just to show interest in the job and then asked if the interviewer had any questions for her?  She said no, and my fiancee thanked her and left.  My fiancee sent a follow up email that night too.  A week goes by and it is almost time for the supervisor to make their decision on the position.  My fiancee gets an email asking for a digital copy of her resume. No problem.  The next day, my fiance gets an email explaining that she did not get the position.

Some extra background about my fiancee..
She graduated from college with a double major in History and Archeology this past spring.
She will be returning to college this fall to obtain her masters in Museum Studies.
The position was for a collections management with a flexible schedule.

tl;dr - fiancee had an interview for her dream job, went very oddly, got declined for job and not sure why.  She is depressed.  Whats a good way to help cheer her up?

My fiancee is a new redditor (almost 2 weeks now)
Some great ideas! I've decided to look into getting a cake made for her looking like a Sphinx

As a professional programmer I find I've reached a point where my skills are just below the level I want to be, and I'm having difficulty finding the best way to move them up.

I've gotten a Computer Engineering degree, I've worked professionally as a web developer building LAMP(HP) web apps for several years (some during school), I've created db-driven web apps used by &gt; 1 million users, I did an internship at one of the major tech companies where I did a lot of Java work. I have the basic language skills (C/C++, Java, PHP, along with some HDLs), lots of db experience, along with architecture patterns like MVC and REST.

I've interviewed 3 rounds at Google, but at the end they said my knowledge wasn't quite there. Same as at some ambitious start-ups attempting to do Google-scale stuff. Basically I'm looking for advice to become a programmer on that level. I'm hoping to move on from basic MVC LAMP web apps to highly-scalable, distributed systems, high-performance back-end (C++ maybe), working with massive amounts of data, concurrency issues, scalability issues, ranking, search, artificial intelligence. All the things that separate novice-level from expert-level.

My current approach:

Utilizing Stanford iTunesU and other free resources every day (1 a day) to ensure I'm constantly learning

Reading

Debating going back for a Masters in Comp Sci, as many of the jobs I apply for say Masters or PhD preferred.

And working of course, but I seem to get the same kind of work I've always done, just marginally bigger every time.

... that's it really

So, to the experts, how did you make the jump from novice to expert? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

There's no passion in the work. The business is very top-down, so on top developing for a small consumer base, no one even really understands how what they work on fits into the big picture. There is no team dynamic in the groups I've seen, and they don't use models that are an effective use of employees' time.

Every speaker, every event, has stressed how important it is to network. Everyone is so concerned with moving up the hierarchy so they make decisions based on that. No one makes career decisions based on what they like do to.

I know I only have a limited view, but the whole point of internships is to check out the business. Tech companies have shorter hour, more impact, and more fun times, and making slightly less seems worth that. On top of enjoying your work, you have more free time to enjoy your life.

tl;dr Investment banks are not for people that want to actually enjoy their lives. If you're a programmer take advantage of those tech companies."

Thanks for checking this post out. To add incentive to things I want to give out a month of Reddit gold to the most awesome piece of advice on here determined by you guys. 

Thanks in advance!

I submitted an amazing job application today for a Leg Correspondent gig at a Senator's office in DC. The job seemed amazingly up my alley (involved all of my skill sets into one position that I'm wild about) and i think i wrote the first cover letter that i was actually proud of. 

Anyway- a few hours later I got an alert that the hiring manager was checking out my Linked in (a good sign I hope) and so if I get an interview I know I'm going to nail this job. (knock on wood) 

Long story short: I would be a transplant from the Art Museum area in Philadelphia. I currently live in a great house with my GF (who is staying in Philly to finish her Psychology PHD before Internship- hopefully in DC), in a very safe neighborhood. 

Couple questions:

1. Where's the safest part of town for my money? I can live in a very small space as long as I know it to be safe for her to visit and stay with me every other weekend.

2. I have no problem with commuting but i'd like to keep it around or under a half hour. I also have a very strange aversion to buses... trains are much more suited to my taste. (i guess i can learn to love buses though) Is this possible for under 1000-1500 (including utilities) bucks a month in rent? (From my research I'd only be making 35/40ish) or so says [glass door](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/US-Senate-Legislative-Correspondent-Salaries-E102346_D_KO10,35.htm)?

3. What's the awesome part of town for my interests? As Philly guy so I live for the Phillies and Eagles (a good sports bar is mandatory) I love nerdy things like D&amp;D, boardgames, and the like... i'm really excited to join up for a Reddit Meetup. 

4. What other advice can you give? I've visited DC at least a few dozen times and loved it more each time. I'm psyched that I might get the opportunity to live down here. 

Thanks so much for he help!

I'm working this summer on an archaeological (more of a combination of oral history, research, and archaeology really) internship in the Bethel Christian Avenue Laurel Hill Historic District in Setauket, NY. This historic Native and African American community has been struggling against discrimination since its establishment around 200 years ago and they now face an even greater threat in the gentrification that has degraded the community in recent years (They've gone from 40 local families around 50 years ago to a mere 14 today).

I've gotten to know some of the residents and they are wonderful people, always welcoming and helpful and talking to any of them, especially their elders reveals the vibrant nature of this community's valuable culture. 

The Higher Ground Inter-Cultural &amp; Heritage Association, formed by one of the remaining community members, desires to preserve this historic culture. They've done amazing work, even achieving their goal of creating the historic district (the only one in NY state designated as such for its cultural rather than architectural value). But to do much more they need funds.

So they entered and became a finalist in this National Trust competition. But they're having trouble spreading the word. So in the interest of preserving history and helping a community I'm entreating you guys to vote for us. All that's needed to vote is an email address and a zip code and it doesn't take more than a minute.

If so, how?",acct987654321,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i3w0b/have_you_ever_intentionally_screwed_up_someones/,"Sometimes, we do things that inadvertently have a negative impact on someone's life. Hell, on the other hand, sometimes people do something that will greatly benefit someone.

We've had a lot of threads about those kinds of things happening. What I'm curious about is if any of you have deliberately done something to screw someone over.

Several years ago, I screwed over an ex. We'd recently broken up, mostly because I found out she was screwing her friend's husband.

I didn't key her car, harm her pets, or do anything else destructive to her property.

Instead, when I learned that she had spent a few days with one a friend messing around with various drugs, I decided to give the place where she did her internship a call and suggest they perform a ""random"" drug test on her, because she had recently taken part in extensive drug use.

She was doing an internship for her masters, working with troubled kids at one of those facilities that they send children to when they have drug, gang, and other such problems. They had a very strict drug policy for the staff, and I knew that she'd taken a drug test at the start of the internship. She and I weren't drug users; I'm still not. I don't have any issue with them, but the facility's policy allowed me to do this.

Well, they tested her. She ended up learning her internship, which had been a key step in acquiring her license/Master's degree. The way she lost her internship put her in a bad spot with her college, and she spent the next couple of years trying to get things sorted out, with no success.

The best part is, I also informed her part-time job (where she worked with children and was responsible for coordinating schedules) and she was suspended for drug use from there as well.

She ended up having to work shitty part-time jobs for three years, before finally getting herself halfway back on track.

TL;DR - Ex fucked her friend's husband, did drugs, I tipped people off and set her career back several years. "

So /r/Austin, what advice could you give me? Is it hard to find jobs right now that pays ~1200-1500 a month for someone without a bachelors? What neighborhoods are relatively safe, but at the same time low rent?

Here's the situation: I am on an internship in Germany for 2 and a bit months, and have just moved into a flat with a very pretty, interesting, and just downright lovely German girl. I am considering breaking the first rule and attempting to pursue something with her. This is not really the problem; whatever happens will happen, and I'm only here for a few months anyway.

The problem is this: I am (to all intents and purposes) in a poly relationship, and my partner will be coming to live with me in about 5 weeks. She knows about this German lass and is very happy for me to pursue her if I want to. However, the German lass does not know my relationship is poly; she does, however, know that the relationship exists.

So I guess I have 2 questions:

1. What's the best way of dropping this casually into conversation? I want to make her aware of this before I begin to make any semblance of a move (I might decide not to make a move, after all).

2. I'm worried that if things happen between me and this lassie, the situation might become weird and hurtful for her when my girlfriend arrives in August. I don't want this, of course, and is the main reason I'm thinking of just leaving it.

So yeah, I leave these questions to the hivemind of /r/poly and look forward to your comments.

* I'm currently borrowing my friend's wireless internet adapter, which I will have to return in a couple of days. I will need one in the new house that I'm moving into and they cost ~ $50.

* I am currently unemployed for the summer and am on a college budget. I've interviewed for a paid internship position and should be hearing back this Monday. I do want to save a money because I am going abroad next semester.

* I'm not sure if a newer model will play or run any better. My console does run a bit slow and has some frame-rate issues from time to time, but I don't know if it's the console or the games themselves.

But I've always been intimidated by ""guy"" guys-- frat guys, jocks, gym rats, etc. I don't know why-- I've always imagined them brimming with confidence, having meaningful social lives with deep connections to many friends (don't ask, I don't know why I had these notions), and above all, being hugely judgmental of everyone who wasn't in their group of friends. Meanwhile, I've always had a bit of a self-esteem issue.

Reading people's comments on r/fitness motivated me to get to the gym, but also showed me something else: for the first time, I got to see the other side of those gym rats. A lot of them are friggin' reddit nerds, for christ's sake. But also, a lot of them are nervous about being in the gym, and a lot of them think anyone who is judgmental is an idiot who doesn't belong there. 

Now when I go in, I still feel like there must be someone judging me, but when I think of that, I also know this: if that person made his views known, there would probably be 5 other people telling him to STFU. Mostly, I realize most everyone in there is just lifting, and they don't care what I'm doing.

For such a small thing, this has had a huge impact on my life in just a small amount of time. First, one small thing: I've become a better basketball player than ever before. It's not because I've gotten stronger, it's the mental shift. I'm not bad at bball, but my style of play has always been really timid. I never ask for the ball. If I get it, I can usually score inside, but I'm always afraid I'll screw up, and that's especially damning if I called for it in the first place, so instead I post up and think ""I'm open, don't pass it to me."" I never shoot outside, even though I have a good shot; if I miss, everyone will be mad at me for taking the shot.

Anyway, that small mental shift that r/fitness gave me has, in this short time, made a huge difference. I've been playing ball 2-3x a week for 3 years in the same gym, and never met anyone. In the past 2 weeks, I've become friends with a handful of regulars who now pick me up if I walk into the gym and they're getting a team together. That never happened before.

This also factors into other areas of my life. I have this problem where if I screw up in front of people, I feel like it's an incredibly overwhelming task to face them again. This has actually led to some huge problems in my studies-- I'm a veterinary student, and in clinics we have to work closely with classmates, interns, and residents. Last year, at one point I literally didn't show up one day to clinics because I didn't think I could face my classmates and their judging me. It's stupid, and I failed the rotation because of it.

Well, that too has changed. Not like, black/white, night/day change-- it's still a problem-- but the transformation that started on r/fitness and continues each time I hit the gym or the basketball court is allowing me to have a much greater amount of self-confidence in every area of my life. And if you weren't aware, self-confidence is hugely beneficial, well out of proportion to what I previously suspected.

Anyway, I feel silly crediting a forum about working out for such a drastic change in my life, but there it is-- I think a lot of my recent transformation has been thanks to you guys. So, thank you r/fitness for making my life better in a hundred big and small ways."

Though I'm happy to have a job where I am gaining experience, the work is very boring and unfulfilling most of the time, 

That said, I'd really like to find another job that will allow me to actually support myself (I'm still on my parent's insurance) and not hate going to work. I've found a job posting - there aren't many for my area - as a Group Leader for Target. Has anyone had this job or heard about it before? I've heard plenty of bad stories about Target and retail jobs in general, but I worked retail for a short time in college and didn't mind it. I liked being active and on my feet at work and being able to help customers. This job sounds like a glorified sales person position where I would be in more of a leadership position (and it would also offer insurance benefits!). 

Should I go for this job, or am I taking a step backward from my boring desk job?

## STATS:

&gt; Male or female? 
&gt;&gt; [Male, age 20](http://i.imgur.com/QWcTE.jpg). 

&gt; Relationship Status? 
&gt;&gt; Single. 

## FAVORITES 

&gt; Cats or Dogs? 
&gt;&gt; I have three dogs, Mogul, a black Labrador, Emma a Dalmatian, and Pancake, her daughter. You could say I’m a dog person (or, more accurately, come from a dog family). 

&gt; Favorite beverage? 
&gt;&gt; Alcoholic: Bourbon—favorite drink of such venerable men as Harry S. Truman and Mark Twain. 

&gt;&gt; Non-alcoholic: Coffee. I am a college student after all. 

&gt; Food? 
&gt;&gt; This is tough. I very much enjoy eating. I will settle on steak though. There are enough ways to prepare it and enough cuts that I don’t think I could get bored easily. I have, however, also always wanted to try a twenty-one course meal. 

&gt; Favorite movie and tv shows? 
&gt;&gt; Movies: My dad was in the film industry before I was born, so movies have been a big part of my life. I think that my favorite movie of all time is *Casablanca*. The scene when everyone in Rick’s sings la Marseillaise is very moving to me and I love Captain Renault. If I had to pick a director though, it would be Jean-Pierre Jeunet—less for his movies like *Amélie* and more for *La cité des enfants perdus* (The City of Lost Children) and *Un long dimanche de fiançailles* (A Very Long Engagement). 

&gt;&gt; T.V.: I don’t get to watch much TV, but I am a huge fan of Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire. 

&gt; Music? 
&gt;&gt; I will give all music a fair listen, but I listen to more classic things on my own time. I like opera, but I think my favorite musician/artist is Woody Guthrie. My parents played his children’s songs for me when I was little and I identify with the political message of his other songs now. 

&gt; Book? 
&gt;&gt; Full disclosure, I read a lot. I get several hundred pages assigned a week when I am in school and I always have a full reading list of my own. My favorite novel is probably *It Can’t Happen Here* by Sinclair Lewis; I am currently reading *Truman* by David McCullough and it has been so far one of my favorite non-fiction works. I am reluctant to pick a definitive favorite for either category, however, because there is still so much left to read. 

&gt; Game? 
&gt;&gt; According to Steam, it’s *Empire: Total War*, but I’m going to overrule the time played and say *BioShock*. I played it shortly after reading *Atlas Shrugged* and I loved the Art Deco aesthetic. 

&gt; What is your favorite word or quote or expression? 
&gt;&gt; ""True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence...People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made."" - Franklin Delano Roosevelt 

## MISCELLANEA: 

&gt; What makes you laugh? 
&gt;&gt; My best friend who I’ve known since I was about 2 or 3. He’s much better than anyone else I know at making me take myself less seriously. 

&gt; What is your biggest pet peeve? 
&gt;&gt; People who don’t use their turn signals. They are on the car for a reason. It also kills me when I come home from school and mine are burnt out and nobody has bothered to replace them—I feel like such a hypocrite. 

&gt; What general area of your country you live in? 
&gt;&gt; The Tri-State Area. However, where I spend most of my time (school: Cornell University), where my parent’s home address is, and where I am registered to vote are all different places. 

&gt; Do you love it? 
&gt;&gt; I love my school. I don’t think I’d have wanted to go anywhere else. My parents moved to where they are now so I could go to a better high school, which I of course appreciate, but the area is too rural/suburban for me; I don’t like needing a car. 

&gt; What was the best thing about the last 12 months? 
&gt;&gt; My job last summer. It does remind me that I am unemployed right now, but I worked for the Democratic Party, which is something I really enjoyed. What was really special though is that in order to get to work, I had to live with my grandfather, who I have absolutely loved since I was born. I woke up at 6AM every day and he would already be up making breakfast. When I would get home around 8PM, we would watch old movies together like *The Jolson Story, Wake Island*, and *Objective, Burma!*. He’s an 87 year old WWII veteran and always has some interesting stories to tell. 

&gt; What are you looking forward to in the next 12 months? 
&gt;&gt; Not much actually. I need to work very hard in the upcoming year to meet my own objectives. I do enjoy the challenge, but I feel more like I did before football games in high school than, say, preparing to go to the Metropolitan Opera. 

## CONCERNING REDDIT: 

&gt; What is the origin or meaning of your user name? 
&gt;&gt; Samuel Gompers was the first and longest serving president of the American Federation of Labor. I study industrial and labor relations and I love history, so it was the perfect name for me. I chose it over other labor leaders like Walter Reuther (who I admire more) because Gompers is a cool name. 

&gt; Total number of reddit identities you’ve had? 
&gt;&gt; One serious one (this one), but I have a bunch of historical novelty accounts like William_McKinley, Franklin-D-Roosevelt, etc. 

&gt; What is your favorite part of reddit? 
&gt;&gt; r/History. It’s usually a great community in which I’ve seen some of the better discussion on Reddit. Compared to r/Politics (my guilty pleasure), it is Harvard and Oxford combined. Actually, scratch that, Cornell and Oxford. 

&gt; What do you do when you’re not on reddit? 
&gt;&gt; Reading and doing work if school is in session. I should honestly be working right now, but I neglected to find an internship (not that I am not still looking) for the summer and I have instead been hanging out with my old friends. 

&gt; Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so? 
&gt;&gt; I lurked for a while before I made my account just over a year ago and I do think there has been a slight change. The amount of memes and inside jokes has increased while the quality of other submissions has remained constant. At the same time, I have started changing what I subscribe to and looking at smaller subreddits, so I think that has mitigated the difference. 

&gt; If so, do you think it’s been for the better? 
&gt;&gt; I think it has accentuated the importance of the subreddit system and that is a good thing. 

## FINAL QUESTION: 

&gt; Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate? 
&gt;&gt; Please read the essays and other long things I post on occasion; I will like you even more if you comment/respond. I’ll definitely post links to a few examples in the comments."

I'm going to try not to get TOO tl;dr here. But I will start by saying that I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and clinical depression, when I was younger, so this is really nothing new, unfortunately. I cannot afford the medication I need. I used to smoke weed, and it really, really helped, but I had a falling out with my guy and can't get it anymore. 

I'm not going to lie, I have been thinking about killing myself a lot over the last year or so. I don't have a plan or a note or anything. But it's a thought that doesn't go away, especially when I am alone, at work. Especially at work, but not exclusively. But over the last week or so, it's something I can't get off my mind. 

Basically, I have no idea what to do anymore. I've been working for going on 4 years at a dead end job at a gas station since I was in college. I'm not going to get in to the work situation, but I can't request more hours because we have ""set hours"" and we all work solo shifts. So what I make now, I'm stuck making until I can find something else. My art degree is completely useless here. I am interested in illustration, character design, that kind of stuff, I loathe graphic design. I had an internship at the museum here drawing dinosaurs and shit, I LOVED it. I applied to work for them when they had an opening, but they turned me down on the grounds that ""why would we hire you to do what you already did for free?"" Not to mention at other art jobs I've applied for, they have no idea what my degree is (""Associates in Specialized Technology with a Focus on Visual Design""). I'm scraping by paying for a student loan for a useless degree. What a wasted two years of my life going to a piece of shit school, I wish someone warned me before I went. 

I don't go out anymore, I don't have friends here anymore. I cut ties with my only two friends after they fucked me over. I work three days a week at said shitty gas station, getting ignored all day unless someone wants something, getting bitched at for this or that, pretty much getting treated like a robot. After a while, I start to believe I should be treated that way. 

I have a girlfriend, she lives across the country. I've realized over the last few months that I love her, but I'm not...""in love"" with her. We have so many things in common, we have a wonderful time when we're together, but I can't help how I feel. I do think about her a lot, it's not a one sided relationship by any means. She said to me today that she feels like she has a best friend moreso than a girlfriend, and I guess I have been treating her that way. When she was here, we went on dates, we made sexy times, all that couple-y stuff. I do feel a very strong attachment to her, but I'm not sure if I'd call them romantic feelings. Even that being said, I am not thinking of leaving her or breaking up with her anytime soon, she makes me happy, and she's completely in love with me. My feelings aside, she is the best relationship I've ever been in, and I don't want to throw it away. 

Recently, she decided she's moving out, and she wants me to move in with her, across the country. This is something I want VERY badly, and have my entire life. I feel like I could be happier out there. I've lived in the same area my entire life, and I hate it. There is nothing for me here. I'm pretty much stuck here, working at a job I hate and browsing the internet, until she says ""hey, okay, I got the place, you can move here now!"" I hate it, I hate how dependent I am on it. I would LOVE to just be able to do this myself, but I simply cannot afford to. I don't have the credit, or the money to be able to get my own apartment across the country, I am not in a position to just pick up and move unless I have a place to go. I have talked to my parents about this move, and my mom has agreed to help me when the time comes, it's the only way I'm able to afford it. My mom agrees that the change would be really good for me. (She has no idea that we're dating. I was kind of kicked out/left when she found out I was with my first girlfriend, so we just don't talk about it anymore. Being gay is the least of my problems, it's one of the few things I am comfortable with about myself.) The job market here is shit, I can't even tell you how many other shitty retail jobs I've applied to just to have some more cash flow, but to no avail. Even after I called back, went to interviews, the whole lead on for a month thinking I have another job. 

Where my gf lives has so much more opportunity for me. I can (hopefully!) get an art job there, as those are much more available in that area. I am completely content in settling for something shitty until I can get a ""real"" job there. I just want out of here, and I want us to be happy. 

But since I've realized my feelings about her, I don't know if I should go through with it. I do love her, very much, but that ""in love"" feeling that I've had before, just isn't there. Sometimes, I really, really do think it's the depression. When I was ""in love"" before, I was in a much happier place in my life. I keep telling myself I'll move out there and see how I feel, but with moving out comes so much money, that I don't have, and lease agreements, etc. What if my feelings don't change when/if I'm happier? Who says moving at all is going to change anything? If I can't find a job with my degree, it changes the place, but not the situation. I was very happy when she visited me a few months ago, I did feel a lot better when she was around, that's why I'm hoping things will change, and I remember those feelings when I get down about things. I think it's the distance that is making me feel the way I do, and my mundane day to day hating everything. My job has made me hate the general public so much that I don't want to leave the house on my days off.  But I'm so worried about being stuck 3,000 miles away from anything I know, hating everything even more. 

I really just want to give up. There is nothing for me here. As excited as I am about the move, I just don't know if I can do this to my girlfriend. What if I get there and realize I really don't love her, or we can't stand each other in a living situation? I know these are chances that need to be taken, but I simply don't have the money to be taking chances. For once, someone wants to help me do something, and I fuck it up, by feelings I can't help. I don't want it to come off as that I'm ""using"" her, because those are not my intentions. I do genuinely care for her. Like I said, we had a wonderful time together when she was here. We've been friends for many years before we started dating, so it's not like I didn't know her at all before this started. 

Everything is just a fucking mess right now. I feel like no matter what I do I just fuck up, what's the point in trying anymore. 


It felt really good to write all that down...I seriously have no one to talk to about any of this. Even if you don't reply, thank you, Reddit. 

Edit: If I don't reply it means I went to bed. I just wanted to get all of this out before another shitty day at work tomorrow..."
i44go,1,2011-06-20,Should I move in with a friend??,yumjello,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i44go/should_i_move_in_with_a_friend/,"I roomed with a girl two years ago while living abroad for an internship. Since then, we've kept in touch and decided to try moving in together once we graduated college. After telling her that I would be up for rooming together, we've been talking about it almost non stop. She just got laid off from her job, which means the move in process can start sooner. 
However, when she came to visit for a few days I started having second thoughts. When we knew each other during the internship, she was very humble, slightly chubby, and open to new things. When visiting this week, she was overly confident, talked mostly about herself or her boyfriend, and acted very judgmental towards me and my family. She's lost 40 pounds since the internship, and now gives me dieting and exercise advice constantly (I'm not on a diet). She's the master of back handed compliments, congratulating me for getting a job while also saying that they're such a big company they can afford to hire anyone. 
This experience has made me seriously doubt and slightly dread moving in together. We haven't signed a lease because I won't know my work location until late August/early September. I'm becoming more and more anxious as the days pass! Should I move in with her because I made the commitment? Should I jeopardize our friendship by telling her I don't want to move in together? Or should I find a way to discourage her from moving in with me so I don't hurt her feelings? If you'd like further description of my situation, please ask. "

I'm 22 and she's 21. I decided to do an internship in a neighboring state for the summer at a camp. This camp is in the woods and I have no cell phone reception. I do have access to the internet, obviously, but this job is a lot of work and very long hours. I've been here about a month, so I'm starting to get the hang of it and have more free time.

My girlfriend was very supportive of me coming here. The first few weeks were really rough in terms of communication. She's been showing a lot of frustration about our lack of communication. It's starting to reach a boiling point with her, I can tell. She's sent me several lengthy facebook messages on the subject. I've assured her that I'm figuring it all out and we'll be able to talk more.

While I've been working today, I saw she was on facebook and started chatting. She is working too, tutoring at school over the summer, so it's been a pretty constant back and forth. I was talking like normal, making jokes and trying to just talk, like she wants. Suddenly she tells her it's making her more sad and continues to bring up how frustrated she is. I tell her I'm trying and that I'm happy to be talking to her and how much I miss her and she says she won't say anything because it will just sound rude. I tell her I have no idea what to do, so she says she's taking her lunch and just logs off.

Additional information:

* While we are just a state away, it's Phoenix to Northern California and it's a two day drive. Plus, I have no car with which to get anywhere.

I'm hoping to lose about 10 pounds in the process, but really I just want to feel active and healthy again.  I have always preferred running, but have had to deal with a weak ankle that was brought on by an injury from years ago.  I have worn an ankle brace while working out for a while now, even when I was on my high school track team, but for some reason it isn't providing much relief when I run anymore.  Now, I can run for about a half a mile before I have to stop because of my ankle.  I'll walk until it feels more comfortable, run again for a little less than a half mile, and then I have to stop again.

I don't think that it's anything I need to get checked out by a doctor, since it only happens when I run (not on a day-to-day basis, or even when I go for a walk or a hike).  I know that exercise like bicycling or swimming will not put strain on my ankle -- and I am prepared to do that instead if need be -- but I really do prefer running.  Any advice on running on a weak ankle?"

I'm currently working as a paid intern for the Navy, and I had another paid internship last summer working at a coaxial cable manufacturer that worked mostly with defense/test/aerospace markets. I definitely could have stayed on at the last job, and I'm 99% sure I could get a job with the Navy when I'm out. In all honesty, they're both pretty well-paying jobs that are tolerable (and sometimes even fun), but I feel like there's something more I should be doing. I've always felt like I had something positive to share with the world. I've also been paying attention to the world around me (for quite some time), and I'm increasingly fed up with the way things are going.

I realize that not everyone agrees on what the best course of action for the planet is, but I think that there are some specific underlying axioms that any decent person could get behind (e.g. access to food/water/shelter, freedom from oppression, all that good stuff). Let's be honest - signing petitions and attending protests doesn't always work (though there have been many counter-examples to this as of late).

Don't sell me on some jaded bullshit that a single person can't make a difference or that it's pointless to try - I've been in and out of that place myself, and I'd rather be an idealist who at least *tries* to do something good and end up succeeding, instead of a jaded cynical bastard who does nothing but shoot down people who try.

What the fuck do I have to do to make this world a better place?

I had one internship, but it became very apparent after only a few months that engineering at a music studio really isn't for me. It was an extremely tough thing to accept considering the 4 years of audio school under my belt and accumulated debt to boot. I did not despair completely though and decided I'd focus my efforts on the a/v post field with plans to seek an internship. It was my favorite class in audio school and the one I excelled the most in. Folley art being a specific, but not exclusively. However, before even starting to look for an internship I put those goals on the back burner to focus on being in a band and traveling. I've recently gotten the itch to get back into it. Although I've fallen off my game a bit, I feel that my skills are hidden, locked away in my brain just waiting to be tapped into. Basically, I want to start working towards my goal of working in the a/v post field, but need to brush up on my general audio, protools, and a/v post knowledge. Somehow in the mess of the last 4 years I lost all of my notes from school. I blame alcohol, drugs, rock and roll, and all around stupidity. Are there any books, websites, tutorials anything you would recommend? Also any tips on attaining an internship would be greatly appreciated. I don't even mind slaving away, unpaid for a while.

I don't know who to ask in real life.. So i hope you all can provide helpful insight.

I am 23. At 18 I began my degree at Wilfrid Laurier ( Waterloo,Ontario) for Global Studies..It was a great program and I am still passionate about that kind of stuff but I wasn't happy at all-- All my family live abroad, I'm the only one here and everyone I knew was in Toronto or GTA.. whatever the reasons may be.. I wasn't happy. So after 2 years I dropped out.

Part 2 of my scholastic life : After dropping out I returned back to the country where all my family live( caribbean) and had a good year. I researched a lot on post-secondary options and finally decided between Film and Media production at Humber or Public Relations at another college. I was set on Film and Media..and i applied.. got all the required documentation together, but needed 2 references from school. I got the first one no problem, and then was given the run around for months from one of my old favourite teachers..finally gave up and asked my old RA from Res in Uni ( cuz i was on House council and stuff) and he obliged. But then his res burnt down ( no lie) along with all his shit..needless to say.. my letter wasn't priority.

He didnt let me know til 3 weeks later. 
The day i found out, I realized the program had closed. Depressed, i looked into my second option. PR. I am a musician, and I am very into social justice/politics. and media in general, so i thought this was a great medium between all my interests.

It was a great but intense accelerated program( 3 years in 2). In my final year (2nd) first semester, after organizing a concert for my perspective internship (throwing a concert series, and working with WarChild ( my dream)) I got and email over christmas from my prospective placement boss saying ""Really sorry to hear that we wont be working together"". Frantic, I email my program coordinator, to which she replied "" Sorry, you failed magazine design, you no longer qualify for placement or second semester"".

After meeting with student liason I realized my options were to withdraw ( and pay back all my osap for the year somehow, and Rent with no money) or stay in school a  a semester and get a 2 year general arts diploma . I chose the latter option. I now have a 2 year general arts diploma.. I am unemployed..could not even get hired at Mcdonalds for the summer.. and now i am not sure what I should do in College/Uni as this diploma is useless.

I am worred about wasting more money, and I am worried about choosing something that I cant get a job.

My passions are music (EVERYTHING), Politics/Social Justice (close second) Film, 


I Know this whole message must be confusing...

so long story short. I am 40 grand in debt, have about 9 Uni credits, a year and half of PR credits, which i transferred and got a 2 year GENERAL ARTS DIPLOMA. 

Should also note, I would just say fuckitall and be a hippy and live with my sister in AUS and see what happens..but i have a Gf who i love very much, and she has a great job as a nurse, making good money so I wanna stay in Canada for now..

How do I convince a lady, I do not directly work with, that I am doing all of the duties assigned efficiently. I have never experienced this type of treatment at any other job and my direct supervisors always let me know when they like or dislike my work ethic. She had the audacity to tell me that the my coworkers don't like my presence because I don't do any of the duties assigned. I was shocked and took up the matter with my direct manager. We were flabbergasted that she could be soo evil.


The worst of it all is that she has forbidden me pursue my studies with this internship. I came in as a Visual Merchandiser, but she has me doing research projects on topics I'm not qualified to do. She doesn't understand the concept of silent selling and that I am making her money by doing what I do.


Jesus christ, what am I going to do?


UPDATE: My boss Cced my internship coordinator on a pretty brutal email in which she states we have a communication problem, I don't do assigned tasks, and that I'm too independent when it comes to said tasks (instead of doing them her way). After clearing my head of all this drama, I replied to both with corrections to all of the allegations and with many sincere apologies.

In a separate correspondence with my coordinator, I explained that there is no possible way that I am at fault (the coordinator knows my history, because I also work with on campus). I expressed that I do not want to give up this internship and suggested what I believe I *can* do if things go downhill, as far as completing the program's assignments. Which I CAN do!

I meet with the boss later today. I'm trying to get one of the managers there to clean the air. I know she will be pissed about it, but I'm at rope's end (I even told her that I was going to do this, but she never addressed it in follow-up conversations). &gt;_&lt;"

I've can stretch food for 3-4 days or so. Technically, I have money in the bank, but every single bill is behind, and I've only been able to pay to keep things on most of the time. In the past few months, I've had water turned off twice, for example. With the exception of $8/mo for Netflix, I think I've pretty much trimmed out all I can. I don't eat out. Electricity, phone, internet + basic cable (no savings dropping the basic cable), water/sewer/garbage, natural gas, gasoline, food, web server (which I'm losing money on, but have to retain because I have two business clients that I can't screw over).

I was slowly gaining on the bills, but I've been unemployed so long that I keep running into expenses that I can't avoid. For example, the tire went out on the truck, so that was $175 to replace. The other three are bald, so it'll probably be a few weeks and I'll have another $525 hitting me... that's one way I'm on the verge of being screwed. I'm down to one good pair of pants, and a couple of ragged ones. I'm a little bit better on shirts; but my one pair of shoes is starting to come apart.

Another is that we now have three years of property taxes that we're behind on - when I worked in 2009, I wasn't able to catch up on that because of previous periods of unemployment; but we're paid through 2008. This year they'll be selling a certificate or something, and if we can't redeem it in another year or two, we'll lose this house.

My wife does work, but her income is being garnished. Basically, we inherited some stock that paid off the house we also inherited (but wasn't fully paid for). Some of the stock also helped cover us when we were both unemployed, and when I was unemployed. It wasn't a whole lot, but it helped. But the paperwork didn't get to the IRS correctly - so they're saying we owe taxes on the stock as though we got it literally for free - they say we owe $14,000. According to what we think, it should be more like $1000, which has been paid -- but they require us to file paperwork that we're having trouble getting from the investment company. So until we can prove that the stock only went up a small amount from when we inherited it, we're losing $500/mo to the IRS.

What I wish is that someone would need a good computer tech / programmer / webhost / website dev / computer generalist. That's what I am. I've been working with computers since 1987, and I have varying levels of experience as tech support, helpdesk, web design (graphics, html, back-end apps in PHP). I've done computer repair. I'm not a terrible PHP programmer, same with Python. I need more programming experience, but I've written several small back-end apps, and one e-commerce type site (a coupon trading site), a couple of other projects...

The problem with finding work is that much of my experience is at least five years old. Moving to Panama City, FL - there's extremely little tech work here. We moved here to help my wife's parents, and when they passed away, stayed in the inherited house.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 30. If you look at my resume, it's a bit patchy - and that's why. Since then, I've made some progress on getting things moving again - I delivered flowers for a year; gave that job up to go back to college, and did an internship for three semesters; but when the IRS problems happened, I couldn't get financial aid; so I was out of college in 2010 - and no internship, so for a year and a half, my recovery has been on hold.

I've decided that I'm completely fine with leaving Panama City at this point. I need work. I need to get medical help for diabetes, which is currently unmanaged. Getting back on Ritalin would be helpful, too; but I can work a tech job or delivery job without that. But I can't get delivery jobs where they test my blood sugar.......

As far as verifying who I am... I'll give you my real identity. It's not a secret for me, because I was the guy that did the Glenn Beck meme website from a couple of years ago. And, by the way, I never made a single penny from that. I kinda wish I had, now. heh. I posted over in [r/forhire right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/hytmj/for_hire_computer_generalist_have_done_lots_of/). You can run a whois on daychilde.com and see that I (Isaac Eiland-Hall) own it - I'm the only Daychilde on the internet. And you can see that eiland-hall.com resolves to the same server as daychilde.com, for example. I also have [a verified AMA for the Beck thing here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9ry42/per_suggestion_i_am_the_site_owner_and_operator/). Well, it had a star, but I see that's gone.

What I could really use:

1. Some help catching up on bills, or some food. Either would help so I don't lose power and/or water in a few days.

2. If you know of anyone who needs a computer generalist who is a hard worker, very friendly, very loyal... an intern programmer (paying intern)... someone whose resume doesn't really show his potential.... Hire me!

I desperately want to do my part to contribute to society. I don't care about getting rich - I just want to pay my bills and accomplish something with my life. I'm a loyal and hard worker. I just need to get my foot in the door someplace so I can show that.

I'll be glad to try and answer any questions you have. And... I don't know what to expect. I don't like asking for help to begin with. When I get a cold, I take aspirin and sleep... I hate asking my wife to get my anything... so writing this is a billion times worse. But things are getting pretty desperate here.

If I could find a tech job - anywhere... I could catch back up on clothing, truck, property taxes, bills. Then my wife could look for work in whatever city I end up in, and that would all be great. Especially if it turned out to be in Seattle - but frankly, I'm ready to put down roots anywhere but here.

I'm open to your suggestions."

2. Concentrate for now on creating programs that perform some simple math calculations and output the results to an ascii text file.
3. Understand the conventions for C subroutine calls, such as using pointers to pass arguments by reference, the ""call stack"", etc.
4. Understand variable and array type definitions &amp; declarations.
5. Understand array index range conventions in C, and their difference from Fortran array indexing conventions.

This year, I have really gotten into web design on my own and am still working a bit on my [first site](http://www.fifaencyclopedia.com) to make it as best as possible. I know it's not all that impressive, but I tried to make it as much of a learning experience as possible, meaning I tried and am trying to implement things I would like to use in the future.

From this, I have gotten quite good at what I would classify ""intermediate"" HTML and CSS. I'm going to start learning some PHP and possibly MySQL (would it be needed?) My next point of action would be to begin working on some more self-owned sites and do as much freelancing as possible, but I'm not so sure I'm experienced enough to do freelancing yet.

In my town, there is a small local web design business that is a popular choice for a lot of local businesses. Looking at their Facebook page, the working environment seems awesome. Mostly younger, less serious guys who still work hard it seems. They have an employees page, and it says a few of the guys worked as interns before being hired full time, but most of them are in or have graduated from college already. 

Meanwhile, I'm only 16 and will be nearly 17 by the time I would be applying (after soccer season as it would be impossible to work during that time). I posted a question to their formspring page (what I'd be like at the time of applying, hopefully):

**Say a 17 year old with some experience in web design (namely HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL) had a decent resume of self-owned sites and some freelancing work, would you consider hiring them as an intern despite age?**

*OF COURSE WE WOULD! The younger the better! We would hire an 8 year old if they knew php WELL and they could CLOSE PROJECTS OUT! Really though, don't be shy! Apply!*

Should I apply for summer work now even if I'm not that experienced yet? What do you think of all this? I really just want a nice environment to get good experience in web design and possibly even be hired somewhere down the line."

i6g5e,2,2011-06-22,Astrometeorology?,ignoramus012,skeptic,https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/i6g5e/astrometeorology/,"I work at NASA as a librarian for one of their satellite projects, and I've recently had a summer intern come work with me. We were discussing our various interests the other day, and he mentioned he was really interested in weather. He was already aware that NASA does a lot of work with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and expressed interest in working with/ for them in the near future.

A little later he said he was interested in something called Astrometeorology, and claimed that the predictions using this method were quite accurate. I had never heard of it, but a quick Google search revealed that it is ""the practice of applying the astronomical placements of the Sun, Moon, and planets to forecast the weather."" Now, I know that the Moon affects the tides, and the Sun can affect our atmosphere to some extent, but my BS detector went off immediately.

When I got home, I searched a few skeptic websites such as here at r/skeptic and skepdic.com and found nothing about this supposed science. Even google had very little information to offer. Is my BS detector on the fritz? If not, why can't I find more information? Could anyone here point me to some factual information regarding astrometeorology?

Secondary question: Assuming I am correct, and astrometeorology is bunk, should I broach this subject with the intern (and if so, how)? If he is interested in career in meteorology, I can see how being a proponent of such pseudoscience could be detrimental to finding a good job. He is hard-working and seems otherwise smart. I'd like to see him do well for himself. If I could have a part in turning him from the path of woo, I'd be glad."
i6fxk,2,2011-06-22,How to deal with a break up?,IxiusRoulee,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i6fxk/how_to_deal_with_a_break_up/,"A little background:

M:21 F:21, I'm the male.

We've been dating for 2 years and 4 months. Over that period of time, we've had our ups and downs and have gotten through them. Recently (Past few months) we've been arguing a lot. Sometimes she says that she isn't attracted to me anymore and wants me to build muscle on my upper body. I'm not fat or overweight at all, I'm a little on the skinny side but I'm not lanky and I find myself to be quite attractive.

This past semester, my grades weren't up to my parent's standards and since I borrow a car from them, my privileges to use the car have been taken away. My girlfriend finds the lack of independence to be very unattractive and she says she doesn't want to be dating a kid and can't respect me. Also she is two months older than me and always makes it seem like I am younger than her by a large margin. She diminishes me in front of my friends and her friends as well. She thinks I'm an idiot and have no common sense or logic, which is completely false. She does get better grades than me (she is one of the best in her class) but I still get pretty good grades, I just have a very strict family (not of asian descent) We decided to take a break until I buy my own car to be able to visit her or get my car privileges back and get my life in order. We still talk a lot and still say 'I love you' back and forth but we've been on the break awhile now and I'm just on the verge of getting my car back. I am also saving money from my internship right now to buy a car and get an apartment for the next year. 

Today, we had a misunderstanding and a fight emerged because of it. She thought I was going to call her to wake up but I was going to call her after she woke up so that I would keep her from going back to sleep. She has insomnia so when she sleeps well it is a big deal, and she didn't have work today so she could sleep in. She said she was going to wake up around 9:30 am, so I texted her at that time to say good morning and see if she was up. She didn't respond so I figured she was able to sleep well so I let her sleep instead of calling and waking her up. Lunch time rolls around and I decided to give her a call. She picks up and gets mad at me for not calling her, I asked her if the alarm went off and she said yes, and she got my text but didn't wake up, respond or call back whatsoever. She says continues to say how dumb I am and have no logic etc. etc. Usually she gets this way just because she is mad so I throw back the counter-arguments ""It was a misunderstanding"" etc. She then says that her friends see my lack of common sense and logic too but I think she points it out to them and amplifies the situation every time something goes wrong. I try to be a wonderful boyfriend, be understanding. I am very patient and have put up with her short fuse and frustration for a long time, but this has gone too far. She's made it clear that she doesn't respect me, and finds me unattractive. 

I know break-ups are tough for almost all situations but I'm not a very assertive person. I still love this girl very much but it needs to end before it goes too far. I can't be in a relationship with a girl who treats me like this. Any words of advice about breaking it off would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR my girlfriend doesn't respect me, and finds me unattractive after 2 and a half years relationship, but continues to string me along. Need help with the mental hurdles of breaking up with a girl who I am still very much in love with.

edit: This is way longer than I expected it to be, ask any questions about anything I may have left out and I will include them in replies and further edits."

My roommate doesn't really have a paying job right now as he is completing an internship at a radio station and I happen to be lucky enough to have a well-paying full time job working for the Help Desk at an IT firm for the summer, so basically I smoke my roommate out atleast once a day.  Anyway, we sit down to watch the movie and I roll a solid 2g blunt for me and  him, which we usually smoke half of and save the rest for after the movie.  last night however we watched the movie Howard Stern's ""Private Parts"" and killed the blunt in the first twenty minutes. The movie finished by 11 so we decided to watch another one.  So of course, being at a sold [4] at this point I decide its time to roll another blunt as well.  This one being just as big as the last, I figure whatever well be pretty high for a while.  Anyway, the second movie starts, the second blunt starts, and a quarter of the way through the blunt, my roommate goes up to his room to call his dad, but tells me he will be right back and keep the blunt lit.  So I keep smoking without him. He took a lot longer than expected and before I knew it I had killed 75% of the blunt myself.  I then ashed it and waited for him to come back.  10 minutes later my roommate returns to find me completely immobile, unable to talk or even think, and my entire upper palate of my mouth felt almost like brainfreeze.  I was so pointlessly high that I literally became a vegetable [10+] for about an hour.  

It was awesome and the highest I have ever been, just thought my fellow Ents would like to know. =]

I'm in a bad, bad funk and need some advice.",obvithrowawayisobvi,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/i6cdi/therapy_time_im_in_a_bad_bad_funk_and_need_some/,"I’m trying to figure out what my problem is. Maybe the armchair psychiatrists/psychiatric patients here at reddit can help. My apologies for the wall of text.

Work life: I feel this may be the root of the problem. My job is not taxing, my boss does not hate me or treat my with disdain, my hours need not be long...but I am unhappy. As a result, sometimes my hours are long. I put off work all the time, preferring to spend time on reddit or other websites. I have gone whole weeks with only doing an hour or so of actual work. As a result, I am constantly stressed that someone will discover this and it will blow up in my face.

I believe the reason I avoid work is because I find my work insulting in that an unpaid intern could do it. (I was effectively demoted about 2 years ago from a position I actively jockeyed for, but which I was losing interest in. I’m still not sure if the demotion was due to my performance because they eliminated my position, splitting what were my responsibilities between two other people. This happened at the same time that several others were completely laid off from the company).

Home life: I feel I go from wasting time at reddit all day to wasting time on reddit, facebook, and whatever videogame has tickled my fancy at home. TV barely interests me, and my girlfriend and I rarely enjoy the same shows together, mostly because she can’t devote attention to anything interesting because she is working at the same time as watching TV...hence, cops/reality TV. I do love and respect her, but we have not been intimate for about 8 months. Part of the problem is me, but she has also been having problems at work and when she gets depressed, she loses all desire. I’ve stopped trying after getting shot down so many times. But at this point, I don’t mind, honestly. The thought of trying to have sex tires me out.

I do have other hobbies and friends that keep me busy, but even there I get the feeling that I bore people now.

I’m worried I may have adult ADHD or depression or something. I know that I need to switch jobs, but I have become so insecure thanks to the demotion and my current low-responsibility job. I’m almost scared that if I got a job that demanded something from me, I wouldn’t be able to rise to the challenge.

My question: what is the first step? Building my resume? Going to therapy? What?"
i6bvl,10,2011-06-22,Need mentoring on SE Career towards the WEB or Lower Level Languages? ,winsyee,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/i6bvl/need_mentoring_on_se_career_towards_the_web_or/,"I am just looking for some mentoring advice. I would be very much appreciated.

**Goal:** Transfer into Software Engineer within my company. I am at an engineering defense company but in a web department.

**Background to Question:** The the SE coding positions use C, C++, ADA, some C#, Java. I will grad with MSE next Summer 2012. While, I will have a masters in SE, I doubt it will be enough to get me into one of these SE positions because I have barely any job experience with these languages. I’ve had 1 class in C++, 2 in C#, and 2 in Java.

**Question: Should I stay with my company IF I get a SE job using lower level languages (C, C++,ADA,JAVA) or move on to a different company as a SE using web languages (HTML5, Flex, PHP, .NET) because my experience is more web oriented?**

**Concerns:**
1. I might not even get a job here at the company without a certification in JAVA, C#, C++ etc.
2. Lower level languages are going away or less to come by??. Web languages are the “future”, especially with mobile development (more opportunities?).
3. Web languages will change too fast. But lower level languages will stay the same.

**Current Employment Background:** I am a “web developer” with 5 years (1 year intern, and 4 years fulltime) in a small 9 person department but only 5 people actually code. My department supports a big company of 2000+ employees, so basically we do whatever needs to be done. We mainly use HTML/CSS, flash forms, actionscript2+, Coldfusion, SQL, Oracle, SQL Server. We maintain our site’s intranet, creating a CMS page for each department. If a department wants a web app, we collect the requirements and develop it, usually with a database. I’ve also had a project here and there using Flex and Excel Macros. Right now I am doing data conversion from File Maker Pro to Oracle. I usually get a lot of tasks maintaining the web apps we build and patching fixing other developers apps.

**Concerns:**
1. I do not feel I have a specialty because our projects are always different.
2.Coldfusion (the main language we use) has limited employment opportunities.
3. Coding environment has no coding standards, source control, and bad management

**Education:** Currently pursuing a Masters in Software Engineering with a Bachelors in CIS

KCP provides the serious student with a unique opportunity for Japanese language proficiency through total immersion. Student-teacher ratio—11: 1. 800 students a year. While most students are from other parts of Asia and all instruction is in Japanese, English-speaking staff provide language support, even special tutorials, as needed for our many U.S. students.

KCP is a convergence of students, aspiring teachers, interns, and professors. Teachers are carefully evaluated for teaching effectiveness and methodology in a series of interviews and active observation. 

Tokyo-area university professors teach the new, innovative KCP Japanese-language teacher preparation program—the only one of its kind at a Japanese language school. 

In addition, Japanese teachers-in-training from nearby universities serve supervised internships at KCP, to supplement your learning and provide more interaction.

KCP student scores on the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (Nihongo Nouryoku Shiken) are testimony to the high quality of language instruction. This test is administered by the Japan Foundation and the Association of International Education. Most students enrolled in KCP’s advanced classes are able to pass Test Level One (the most difficult). This level of Japanese proficiency usually allows them to enter a Japanese university as a full time student.

KCP International Japanese Language School is in Shinjuku--the business, entertainment, and shopping center of Tokyo. It's a 5-minute walk from the Shinjuku Gyoenmae subway station on the Marunouchi line, or a 10-minute walk from Shinjuku san-chome subway station on the Toei Shinjuku line."
i62ok,1,2011-06-22,Going back to previous employer,jobworries,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/i62ok/going_back_to_previous_employer/,"Obvious throwaway, don't want my regular account connected to this.

My situation is as follows: I go to university and am one thesis short of getting my BS in Information Systems. After my 2nd semester, I started working with a company. It was a small internet startup (much bigger today, steadily growing) and they hired me initially for an internship over 2 months. After that I started working for about 1.5 years there as a working student (10-15hrs/week).

I decided to leave because of the lack of professionalism. As an aspiring programmer I really enjoy well-written code and decent architecture, which that place completely lacked. Everything was messy php code mixed with HTML, different style guides etc. I was actually told to not have my code as elaborate as I made it so other people could handle it (new employees, people with little programming skill). Given that I wanted to really extend my knowledge of programming further (also in other languages), and I felt like I stagnated for months there and didn't learn anything new, it felt like it was time to go.

So I switched to another company, which is a huge fortune 500 company (or rather a subcompany directly owned by one. Legally, I'm employed by that F500 company, though. So it looks good on a resume.) It was off to a rough start - I wasn't really able to make contact with colleagues and from the start I felt kind of left out, not only because I was the only working student and by far the youngest, but also because nobody seemed to make any effort to integrate me like inviting me to come along for lunch etc. On top of that, I started doing Java+Spring, which I barely knew before, so I only learned it on the job and didn't really have any opportunity to feel pride in my work.
After 3 months of just learning how to do things with Java &amp; Spring (I didn't really learn anything company-specific, but instead spent my time to do tutorials off the internet which sometimes were absolutely unrelated to company stuff), I talked to my supervisor about actually developing some code.
So then I got assigned my first project which was to remake the GUI of a web application using XHTML and CSS (remember - I left because I wanted to do serious programming stuff, Java &amp; OOP). I was actually quite happy to finally get to do something that I knew well even though it was absolutely non-challenging, and did a good job with it. On top of the one design I created, I made 2 more, and now it seems that project is finished.

However: It now seems like I've become the ""CSS-Guy"". The guy that does front-end work in JSP templates. Who is the guy that will do redesigns for every application we ship. I absolutely do not want this. I switched to this job because I didn't want to do frontend stuff, I wanted to learn legitimate programming skills, and for that I accepted making 35% less money per hour, along with not so nice work conditions such as a shitty computer, one screen, old software etc, and even put up with the bad social work environment in hopes of one day doing good work. Also, working with CSS really, REALLY sucks with the tools they provide me with. I can't install any programs, I'm forced to use IE 7 (not IE 9 which has great debug tools + emulation for IE 7/8), I only have one screen which is also not large), I don't even have photoshop or any editing software for that matter.

Now I'm in a place where I'm seriously thinking about going back to my old employer. I know they'd hire me back in an instant, but I'm worried about the consequences. Not only will I give up being able to write my thesis here (which sucks because I was very specific about the topic, I don't think my old employer could provide that topic), but my CV basically would say: 1,5 years employer a, then 8 months employer b, then back to employer a.
The upside is that I really enjoyed working there while I did, people were awesome and it was really flexible and good pay. More importantly, the turned around now and apparently are using better approaches with more OOP and reusability. I would find it very interesting to go back there.

I just haven't felt truly happy with work ever since I started working here and I feel like I'm wasting my time.

So: should I put up with these shit conditions and just suck it up solely because of the name on my resume?
I'm not even sure if I want to start working in a large company later or if more small company experience might be better.
Or should I quit, go back to the old job and be happy?

**TL;DR**
Had a sweet job with great pay, left due to lack of challenge, found new job, less pay. new job now stigmatizes me as a css guy which is even less challenging than old job. Should I go back to old job after 8 months? How will it look on my CV?


Thanks for all advice, jobbit!

I'm entering my senior year in a Computer Engineering program. I know a good chunk of C++, I vaguely remember basic Java, and I know some introductory assembly language. The internships I am applying for require me to know a bunch of languages varying from HTML, CSS and JavaScript to shell scripting to python/perl to LAMP to networking. I feel like I'll never catch up with the industry (at least not the proficiency level I'd like to achieve). 

What can I do? 
Or am I just being paranoid? 

I don't honestly want to do a LOT of programming (I would've been a Computer Science major if I loved it *that* much), since I'm trying to focus on chip design or computer hardware in general. 

I would also like to learn how to be a good unix admin, I'm running crunchbang (which is basically just a version of debian squeeze) so I should have all the tools at my disposal. How would I go about setting up a nice ""network test sandbox""? 

I have so many more questions in my mind that's kind of bringing me down so any help is much appreciated!

I'll tell my piece. I'm currently interning for 9 weeks with Price Charities, a family foundation in San Diego. It was founded by Sol Price (you might know him as the founder of Costco). They work on issues of urban development almost exclusively in the City Heights neighborhood here in San Diego. I'm personally going to be working on research that will help the opening and running of a school-based health center in one of the middle schools in the neighborhood. (Anyone who wants to read about SBHCs can learn more [here](http://www.nasbhc.org/site/c.jsJPKWPFJrH/b.2561553/k.843D/about_sbhcs.htm), and more on Price Charities [here](http://www.pricecharities.com/).

The work is nice, and I'm finding out that I could never make a career out of sitting in a cubicle or an office. I'm having a blast and learning way more from exploring the community and talking to people, even if the AC-conditioned buildings are getting awfully tempting with the recent weather. Also, I'm finding just how much health and wellness in education is a seriously underrated issue. All of the nurses I've run into are incredible, and it's no wonder some of these kids can't learn if their minds and bodies are all sorts of a wreck."

The updated information is they admitted her to the hospital, and she has an actual room now, and may be there 4-7 days.

A little info I forgot to include in the other post: She usually lives about 30-45 min away from me, depending on traffic. She actually was just visiting this past weekend, as she has an internship 4 hours away, where her parents live.

I hope this doesn't sound selfish, but right now I seem to be having trouble figuring out what *I* am supposed to be doing. She wants me to come visit her, and I feel bad since she has no one else here. I know she was finally calling both her parents (they don't live together) tonight after I talked to her, but I'm not sure if they're coming or anything.

First of all, I'm not sure me being there is a good thing. At some point I'd think she will go from thinking I'm this great guy she's in love with, to thinking about how she's there because I called 911. She already said today she wished I had just come myself, and taken her to the E.R. so she would be there voluntarily. I told her maybe it's a good thing they are keeping her there. The Craigslist post was incredibly fucked up, and so was reading the notes.

Sorry for rambling, but I guess the advice is, what can I do for her, and what can I do for myself? I do not have any desire to get back together with her, but I'm pretty sure she still does. Another reason I'm not sure if her seeing me is good or not. I did promise her I would bring her some stuff from her apartment, so I am going to see her at least one more time, unless there's an unexpected twist."

**[I am a failed entrepreneur. A little guy who lost to the big corporate bullies of the free market. Ask Me Anything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/c9iq1/i_am_a_failed_entrepreneur_a_little_guy_who_lost/)**  
  

Many years ago I created, developed, perfected and marketed Wiggly® Brand Mayonnaise -- the richest, creamiest, wiggliest mayonnaise in the south.   
  

I made the mayonnaise myself; the first experimental batch I made in the bathtub turned out chunky and too yellow.  After that (and following my wife's accident), I was forced to move my mayonnaise lab down to the basement.  It was trial and error for the first couple of months as I tried to find new and exciting ways to improve and invigorate mayonnaise.  But once I perfected it and got it just right it was beautiful.  So thick you could lay on it.  I knew I had created a mayonnaise that would go far beyond being a condiment for food.  The applications of Wiggly® Brand Mayonnaise would be endless...
  
I bottled it in mason jars and sold it out of my home.  Once word of mouth about my mouthwatering mayonnaise spread all around town, I started selling it at the farmer's market.  Soon I had the grocers and druggists begging me to let them sell my mayonnaise.  That meant I had to make much more mayonnaise.  
  
During the summer months I recruited some strapping young interns from the schoolhouse.  I couldn't pay those young lads much (a dollar a day plus all the mayonnaise they could carry home in their pockets) but I was able to give them the one thing they wanted most: Sense of Accomplishment.  For me, it was more than just male bonding and mayonnaise in my sweltering hot basement.  That was probably the best summer of their lives.  
  

Soon I worked out a distribution deal with Piggly Wiggly supermarkets to test out Wiggly® Brand Mayonnaise at half a dozen of their stores in Tennessee and Kentucky.  They were even going to let me slather advertisements all over their stores from the windows to the walls.  Unfortunately, the Big Boys of Mayonnaise -- Hellmann's, Blueplate, Duke's, Zippy's, Gold Medal and, of course, the behemoth of them all: Kraft and their vile Miracle Whip* -- ran me out of town.  
  

The big food companies pretty much dictate how much supermarket shelf space is made available for all products, not just their own.  Especially mayonnaise!  I got about six inches on the bottom shelf, barely enough space for a single jar-wide row, and close enough to the floor where the cleaning crew's floor scrubbers and waxers would dirty up my mayonnaise mason jars on a nightly basis.  
  
I never had a fighting chance.  I only sold a few cases and after just three months Piggly Wiggly sent me packing.  That was the beginning of the end.  The dark days of mayonnaise had come.   
  

I still make mayonnaise for my own consumption and for gifts (look out Secret Santa!) but I'm out of the mayonnaise selling business for good.  Too many bad mayonnaise memories.  
  
Those were the golden days of mayonnaise, long before mayonnaise culture was sullied by cheap gimmicks like light mayonnaise, vegenaise (who could love you?), and wide-mouth jars.  Back then it was about the mayonnaise.  
  
Ask me anything about my mayonnaise business or about mayonnaise in general.  I consider myself an expert on the subject.  I'll even share my mayonnaise inclusive recipes (like my triple fudge mayonnaise cake made with real mayonnaise!).  Mayonnaise has limitless uses beyond food.  Ask me about what mayonnaise can do for you.

I have gotten so much enjoyment answering all of your curiosities about mayonnaise.  Many of you are so eager to learn about mayonnaise!  I'll be back in the morning...

**Make your own Wiggly Mayonnaise at home.**  
(Although it's not authentically Wiggly without Grandpa Wiggly!)  

  

**INGREDIENTS**  

* half a cup of peanut oil (or a favorite flavorful nut oil of your choosing)
* half a cup one cup of corn oil
* one tablespoon of sesame oil (optional)
* two egg yolks (one egg yolk for every half cup of oil)
* one tablespoon of honey Dijon mustard
* one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice or white wine vinegar (or half of both)
* one small squeeze of indigenous honey
* one garlic clove, crushed (optional)
* a pinch of salt
* a pinch of pepper
* a pinch of paprika (optional)
* a pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)
* a pinch of onion powder (optional)
* a pinch of tarragon (optional)  



  
**INSTRUCTIONS**  
  
* All of your ingredients should be at room temperature before you begin.  I prefer right at 21 degrees Celsius (70 degrees Fahrenheit).  
* Add the eggs and half of the lemon juice and vinegar together in a bowl and lightly mix together.
* Slowly add your half of your oil mixture while whisking (not folding) everything together.  It will start to thicken nicely, forming mayonnaise.  
* Add the remaining half of your lemon juice and vinegar.  Whisk.
* Add the remaining half of your oil.  Whisk.  The more you whisk, the thicker your mayonnaise will be.
* Add the honey Dijon mustard, honey and lard.  Incorporate them into the mixture.
* Add the salt, pepper and other spices.  Whisk.  Whisk.  Whisk.
* You now have Mayonnaise in its simplest form!  Resist the urge to eat it.  Your mayonnaise will have more of a creamy light yellow color than store bought mayonnaise.  That's how you know its homemade mayonnaise!
* Refrigerate your mayonnaise for at least two hours, allowing it to cool completely.  If you're planning on bottling your mayonnaise in mason jars still allow it to cool first. 
* Once your mayonnaise has cooled you can enjoy your mayonnaise.  But save Grandpa Wiggly some!
  

Some mayonnaise recipes call for sugar, not Wiggly Mayonnaise.  I prefer to add a little sweetness to my mayonnaise using a sweet honey Dijon mustard and a dash of honey.  Always use indigenous honey!  You should buy local honey and only eat honey that is indigenous to your area and climate.  No sugar means a healthier mayonnaise!  
  
Olive oil, especially EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil) will make your mayonnaise tangy and too heavy.  Eventually the weight of the olive oil will cause it to separate from the egg and that's not mayonnaise. If you truly desire the taste of olive oil in your mayonnaise then substitute it for one-fourth (but no more than a half) of your corn oil.  
  
For extra EXTRA thick mayonnaise: Freeze your eggs over night and then allow them to thaw.  Make sure they cool to room temperature before you begin to make your mayonnaise.  
  
For a thinner mayonnaise: Add in heavy whipping cream, half and half, or milk.  The more you add, the thinner your mayonnaise will be.
  
If you want your mayonnaise to be extra rich use only egg yolks.  
  
Mayonnaise with just white wine vinegar and no lemon juice will have a longer shelf life.  Ideal if you're making mayonnaise for the season or for holiday/birthday gifts.

While I am here, I am working two unpaid internships in theatre, which is what I am interested and pursuing a degree in, and working a job midnight til 8 on campus to support myself. 

Unfortunately, the way my school's pay system is set up, I won't be paid until my second pay period; next week. So for this entire month I have not yet been paid. Luckily, I bought groceries. 

Two weeks ago our fridge broke and by the time it was replaced, we had to throw out all our eggs, cheese, some meat, and milk. Then, three days ago, our electricity was shut off. 

The reason we have no power is because the tenants who rented the house before I moved in did not pay their last bill. There was no discrepancy on my part, but the LIPA cannot turn my power back on until Saturday or Sunday. 

Right now, I am in one of the theatre's I work in, and I was wondering if any redditor would be willing to send a pizza to my roommates and I so we can have something to eat until Sunday. 

Thanks!"

And the less I do, the worse I feel.",DVNO,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/i7is9/got_the_rest_of_the_summer_to_kill_and_the_less_i/,"Let me start out by saying that I was hesitant to post this here. I posted here in the past, and was once told rather bluntly that I wasn't ""depressed enough"" to deserve replies and was insulted when I explained that I had been on medication in the past. Needless to say, it wasn't the best experience, but it was mostly one individual, so I thought I'd give it another try.

I'm a 22 year old guy, just graduated college from a good school with a degree in mechanical engineering. I've experienced ""depressive episodes"" for a few years. Some days I'm fine. Some days I'm just a little grumpy. And some days I can barely function. And these feelings can last for as little as a day, or as long as weeks. Lately I've been pretty good, but not great. Some days better, some worse.

I haven't found a job yet. I interviewed with a few places, but only with companies that I'd be excited to work for. I have the rest of my life to work, and it seemed stupid to rush into a job. My alternative plan is to go out west and snowboard for a year. Kind of take a year off. And luckily my parents A) support this idea and B) can help support me financially in the meantime. And who knows what doors that could open down the line?

But right now, I'm home, it's summer, and I have no job. My two best friends have full time jobs / internships, so their days are pretty busy. They wake up at 6 AM, work all day, and then go to bed by 10 PM. They both have girlfriends, so I have to battle for their free time as well. So basically, I find myself alone during the day with very little to do. And I can feel myself starting to slip back into negative thoughts. 

As I have less and less to do, I feel worse about myself. I just feel worthless. I want to wake up early and ""seize the day"", but when there's not much I have to get done, it's difficult to wake up early. So I sleep in until noon, kill time during the afternoon, and kill time at night. I've tried to shake things up a bit. I've been going to the gym with one of my friends, but it's beginning to feel like more of a chore than a confidence / mood booster. I picked up cooking for a bit, but now that my mom is off for the summer (she's a teacher), she's been handling most of that.

When I do leave the house, it boosts my mood a bit. I went to buy a few shirts the other day, and chatted with the girl the that was working the register. And even something as tiny as that put me in a better mood. But I'm not sure how to replicate that. I don't have much other reason to leave the house. And I'm a pretty quiet person, so it's difficult for me to strike up a conversation with strangers anyway. And I don't exactly have the budget to go and buy T shirts every day just so I can talk to the cashiers. 

So I'm kind of at a loss right now. I want to go out and do things because I know it'll probably make me feel better, but I'm usually alone and I just don't really have any ideas. I'm not really asking for a list of hobbies to pick up (I can look for that myself), but maybe just some tips on handling this situation I'll be facing for the rest of the summer?"

i7c9q,2,2011-06-23,"Reddit, what is your best/craziest ""wait, what just happened"" or ""how did that just work"" story??? ",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i7c9q/reddit_what_is_your_bestcraziest_wait_what_just/,"A few years back, my cousin was making an increasingly rare visit to see me and other family. After both having lived in Austin, TX and attended the University of Texas (Hook 'Em!), my cousin went on to serve in the military, and I stuck around Austin.

Given the rarity with which we now see one another as well as our fondness for 6th street, the bars we used to frequent in our college days, and just alcohol in general, we decide to go out as soon as he gets to town. It was a Wednesday (I think).

Fast forward about 12 hours. As I gradually emerge from slumber, I am overcome with a desire to spew instantly but manage to keep myself from doing so. As I continue to regain consciousness and greater awareness of my being, I also begin to notice things like moderate back pain and a large cut on my hand. After I rub my eyes to remove gunky build up, a quick look around reveals that, in what must have been a drunken stupor, I had decided to crawl up on to my kitchen counter and pass out (for the life of me, I still don't know why . . . know one else was in my apartment, and I had two vacant beds). Exhausted and in pain, I decide to roll to my left and reposition myself on my side in an attempt alleviate some of the back pain that must have been/is being caused by sleeping on a granite countertop. As I do so, the oven clock comes into view. It's 10:30 am. wtfuck

To this point, I had been relatively calm. Sure, I am hungover as fuck, have a huge cut on my hand that I can't explain, and for some reason I am sleeping on my kitchen counter, but that's pretty routine for a weekend in the ATX (once again, Hook 'Em!) . . .but not for a Thursday morning on which I am supposed to report on the state of my section to the managing partners/my employer.

Crisis mode:engage.

Brain activity instantaneously goes through the roof. I sprint to my room and grab my phone. I dial one of our office interns. As collectedly as able, I ask him to let everyone know that I am running a bit behind for the meeting and that I would appreciate if he could make and distribute copies of the materials I had prepared , then I strip off my clothes and hop into the shower. For anyone wondering, it is in fact possible to soap, shampoo, brush your teeth, and rinse all of the above in under 30 seconds if you are okay with missing a few spots.

After I hastily semi-dry myself, I proceed to the closet to pick out some clothes. As I try to decide what to throw on, my mind is also racing trying to figure out what sort of explanation I am going to give as to my tardiness. 

When I arrive at the entrance of the office, I take a deep breath and put on a California afternoon smile. As I breach the main entrance, I walk deliberately slow, flashing the smile and (exceedingly) happily greeting everyone that I encounter en route to my office, doing my best to display a non-typical casualness and disconnect from work matters while sporting my finest power suit. Clearly I had just come from some non-work related activity - perhaps talking to a classroom or some junk. Truthfully, my brain with a hangover is bad about details. I didn't really know from where this character had just come, but I knew a suit would say that it was important and that perhaps I am justified in being late.

When I reach my office, I decide to let word of my arrival circulate the office on its own rather than calling to let anyone I am now available to proceed with the meeting. A few minutes later, the phone rings - caller ID tells me it is the big boss. Before I answer, I give myself a 5 second mental pep-talk and tell myself to stay the course.

I will interject with a little back story: Our core business was breaking even at the time. We had recently gotten into a new area of business conducting what I will simply refer to as ""projects"" that was highly profitable and growing. We had just secured a new multi-million dollar project (very big deal for our relatively small company), and I was essentially project management. I was supposed to be detailing procedures, timelines for deliverables, staffing needs, etc in the meeting that morning. Now back to the story.

I answer the phone and greet the BB (Big Boss) as chipper as I had everyone else. I make no mention of the tardiness he was likely waiting for me to explain. Eventually, he asks me directly how I could have been late for the meeting. In a carefree and upbeat tone, I apologize and tell him that I had an important meeting that ran late that morning. He didn't say anything for what seems like an eternity.

At this point, I expect him to raise his tone a bit and tell me to get to the main conference room immediately. He doesn't. Instead, he very coldly tells me to be in his office in 30 minutes. Curve ball.

Instead of game planning, I sit in my office drinking water and trying not to throw up. 30 minutes simultaneously fly by and seem to last forever, and I make my way over.

When I get to the BB's office, I am surprised and disturbed to see a senior HR staff member there along with all the managing partners that work in Austin/that office. I freak out a bit on the inside, but it's too late to turn back now. I decide the smile stays.

I walk into the office and greet everyone warmly, then I have a seat. Someone gets up and closes the door behind me. I notice the person from HR has a notepad and no one else is holding anything. A little piece of me dies.

The BB asks me why I was so late to such an important meeting, to which I respond along the lines of ""Yes, I'm very sorry. I had an important meeting this morning that ran quite a bit longer than expected."" Next, he asks ""An important meeting . . .?"" Being hungover, my brain decides to suck and I can't think of a feasible meeting type, so I go with another response that is vague and doesn't really respond to the question he had implied. ""Yes, it was probably poor decision making to schedule it on the same day. I won't make such a mistake in the future."" I smile and hope we are done here.

The partners all look at each other as I sit in awkward silence. My BB responds with something like ""We are on the eve of starting this company's largest project to date, and you are out interviewing for other jobs!""

I'm caught totally off-guard and stopped dead in my tracks. Deer in the headlights.

I sit quietly for a moment. I start to see the bigger picture. As I previously explained, the projects were not a part of our core business, and as such, the partners were not experienced our knowledgeable as to the details of their operation. Given the size of the company, redundancy was rare, and I was essentially the only one that knew operations/process inside and out, and for that matter, the only one that knew the specific progress, plans, etc for existing projects. Given my tardiness, the suit, and my referring to an ""important meeting"" as causing my tardiness, they have all reasoned that I was at a job interview. And given the bigger upcoming project, growth in demand for the projects in general, and my mini-monopoly on some of the information, they all seem to be on tilt.

I decide to take it in stride and go with it, as I have no other better explanation. I try to downplay it and diffuse the while situation by responding ""I am not actively looking for other employment or anything like that - if I was I would tell you. I simply like to know what my options are and what my services elsewhere are worth. I've been on other interviews while working here, and no one has taken exception to it before. Back in my school days, I was taught to always know your options and to know what you are worth.""

My BB turns red (yes, he is one of those) and erupts. ""Do you think you can angle for raise right before we start this project"" yadda yadda yadda. Hungover me didn't understand how he had brought about such a response, but sober me gets it in retrospect.

This continues for some time. I try to play it cool and give collected, non threatening responses, but I think that just made the guy even more angry, like I wouldn't fess-up or like I was so calm because I knew I had him by the balls. Really, I was nervous as shit. I was thinking:

   1. Man, I need to hurl.
   2. It's hot in here with this jacket and tie.
   3. Fuck, I might get fired
   4. Hmmm, no one has noticed the huge cut on my hand or that it has started to bleed.

After he's done talking at me, he sends me away and tells me to get back to work. I'm worried by the fact that we are not having the meeting.

I sit in my office for the next couple of hours thinking over the whole situation. I am FUCKED. As I sit there thinking:

1. Hmmm, my resume needs to be updated
2. My friend mentioned that his company was hiring
3. Damn it, I'm going to beat the snot out of my cousin

the HR rep calls me and asks me to come to her office. Sigh, I didn't really like the job or the company that much anyways, not the end of the world. I take a moment, and when I am ready for it, I head over.

I sit down. She gets up and closes the door. If history is an indicator, that wasn't a good sign.

She begins to speak; ""GarrettGilberPass, BB and the other partners are not pleased that you are out interviewing for other jobs."" I think to myself, here it comes. ""We are prepared to offer you a raise to your annual salary in the amount of $XX,XXX if you sign a new employment agreement for 2 years, in which you are required to obtain approval before interviewing with other organizations"". Best wtf moment ever.

SOOO, I guess I got a raise?

**tl;dr:**

   **1. Drank like a fish**

   **2. Woke up late and threw on a suit**

   **3. Showed up late for work when I had an important meeting**

   **4. said I was late because I had a different ""important meeting""**

   **5. got a raise**

**Also, granite countertops apparently look more comfortable than pillow-top mattresses when you are piss-drunk.**

I would be very much appreciated.

**Goal:** Transfer into Software Engineer within my company. I am at an engineering defense company but in a web department.

**Background to Question:** The the SE coding positions use C, C++, ADA, some C#, Java. I will grad with MSE next Summer 2012. While, I will have a masters in SE, I doubt it will be enough to get me into one of these SE positions because I have barely any job experience with these languages. I’ve had 1 class in C++, 2 in C#, and 2 in Java.

**Question: Should I stay with my company IF I get a SE job using lower level languages (C, C++,ADA,JAVA) or move on to a different company as a SE using web languages (HTML5, Flex, PHP, .NET) because my experience is more web oriented?**

**Concerns:**
1. I might not even get a job here at the company without a certification in JAVA, C#, C++ etc.
2. Lower level languages are going away or less to come by??. Web languages are the “future”, especially with mobile development (more opportunities?).
3. Web languages will change too fast. But lower level languages will stay the same.

**Current Employment Background:** I am a “web developer” with 5 years (1 year intern, and 4 years fulltime) in a small 9 person department but only 5 people actually code. My department supports a big company of 2000+ employees, so basically we do whatever needs to be done. We mainly use HTML/CSS, flash forms, actionscript2+, Coldfusion, SQL, Oracle, SQL Server. We maintain our site’s intranet, creating a CMS page for each department. If a department wants a web app, we collect the requirements and develop it, usually with a database. I’ve also had a project here and there using Flex and Excel Macros. Right now I am doing data conversion from File Maker Pro to Oracle. I usually get a lot of tasks maintaining the web apps we build and patching fixing other developers apps.

**Concerns:**
1. I do not feel I have a specialty because our projects are always different.
2.Coldfusion (the main language we use) has limited employment opportunities.
3. Coding environment has no coding standards, source control, and bad management

**Education:** Currently pursuing a Masters in Software Engineering with a Bachelors in CIS

How about oral sex with a white house intern like Bill did? 

And look at the corruption on Wall Street, how many women were involved in that? 

It just seems to me that women have a better record of integrity than men. Without offering something of substance, it is almost impossible to persuade a professional woman. What do you think?

Also, how many women compared to men have been charged with murder? Wouldn't a women be less likely to send us to war if it wasn't absolutely necessary?

I'm not being sexist, I'm just looking at the track record of men compared to women in public office or professional positions.

I don't know if I made it obvious that I liked him or whatever, but he told me recently he went on a date. So, I am obviously friend zoned. And that's OK. He's an awesome guy and I wouldn't just mind being his friend. But before he dropped the 'I'm seeing someone' I wrote him a letter - it's NOT a love letter (me thinks). Since he is such a good friend, I was wondering if it would be acceptable for me to give him the letter?

I'm a long time college redditor with an internship in Seoul starting next week. I'll be there for over two months and would love to get some practice in before the next school year starts.

Now, I know that there are a lot of Japanese sedditors, but I've been told that Korea's night life is much more different and complex (i.e. there are nightclubs and just clubs with different dynamics) and can be pretty hard for a non-native (I'm a Korean American, so I feel like the typical American approach won't work either).

So yeah, is there any general advice seddit could give? A different website or a forum suggestion would be great, too, especially since I can read Korean very well."

i6tv2,4,2011-06-22,The July Effect: You are no more at risk going to the hospital in July than any other month. Except for this year.,DocIrish,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/i6tv2/the_july_effect_you_are_no_more_at_risk_going_to/,"The TIL community has [a sensationalist post](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/i6n8y/til_deaths_due_to_medical_mistakes_increase_by_10/) up regarding the JULY EFFECT *Bum da dum!* and how going to the hospital this upcoming month will kill you. 

Every year the popular press gives us this topic, and every few years the medical community will publish a paper refuting it or supporting parts of it. The article that the CNN piece refers to was published last year in May [(Full text here)](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fi2.cdn.turner.com%2Fcnn%2F2010%2Fimages%2F07%2F08%2Ffulltext.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=David%20P.%20Phillips%20jgim&amp;ei=paICTpPLN6bRiAKRq_ijBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGoB-X3K2YWY4UiI4WLgWSSGo9wQ&amp;sig2=oYkSC4aUbmy64Oi10dw7IA&amp;cad=rja) and is worth taking with a grain of salt for a number of reasons:


* 
as in all papers, it emphasizes the positive findings and minimizes the negatives.  The pertinent negative in this study was that [overall deaths were exactly as predicted in July](http://i.imgur.com/KBjkw.png), and that medication errors in July were also 4% higher in non-teaching hospitals although this failed to reach significance. 

* while the lay press and redditors have claimed that this means you shouldn't get a surgery in July, despite no evidence of this sort in all but one paper, surgical morbidity and mortality is [actually](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19717044) [equivalent](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19474693) (and actually non-significantly lower in the JGIM article) for both trauma and elective surgery at teaching hospitals in July. The oft-cited piece in favor of a July Effect is this [Annals of Surgery paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1959349/?tool=pubmed) which states that there is a seasonal variation in surgical morbidity, with [\(peaks in July and January.\)](http://imgur.com/sxFUp)This was hugely controversial when it was presented in 2007, and many discussants were not included in the writeup. However, as pointed out in the discussion by Dr. Lillemoe of Johns Hopkins, Indiana, and now Mass General fame, there are multiple peak months on that plot, which happen to coincide with peak vacation times of attending physicians, rather than peak months for new residents.

* other researchers have examined this phenomenon and found that a potential explanation for observed outcome differences is that [handoffs](http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/103/11/895.extract) increase in July (August in the article), due to the aforementioned vacations and new interns, leading to cross-coverage issues (taking care of a patient you are not familiar with for a partner). 

Now assuming for a moment that increasing handoffs/changeovers increases mortality (far more substantiated than the new intern July effect): Starting July 1, new work hour restrictions for interns present a double-edged sword for these issues. 

Interns can no longer be on call. They can only be in the hospital 16 hours at a time, and must have senior housestaff available in the hospital at all times. This is great for the supervision aspect of things. 

However, because they can only work 16 hours at a time, we now need 2 interns to cover a 30 hour call shift, whereas before this could be achieved with one. This doubles the number of changeovers in most cases, and can actually quadruple them depending on the services covered and the hospital. It reduces the amount of time a given physician gets to know a patient's status, and increases the number of times some bit of information about that patient's status can be lost in transmission.

So, in conclusion, to be safe in the hospital, get to know your surgeon if you're going for a planned operation, ask questions about your care and be a proactive patient if you can, but otherwise, try to ease your mind that while you are in a teaching hospital you will be receiving excellent care that is double checked by multiple layers of physicians (intern, resident, attending) and nurses who are watching our butts.


**tl;dr** Doctors suck and are actually trying to kill you.

I was told to let them know tomorrow what a ""reasonable wage"" would be.

i7nyh,8,2011-06-23,"Ladies, please help me interpret this (Warning: I hope you like reading), it's pretty perplexing.",throawayperson,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/i7nyh/ladies_please_help_me_interpret_this_warning_i/,"I'm sorry I can't make this shorter, ladies, but it would really be great if you could help me out. Before I start - this is out of sheer curiosity, I am not pursuing a relationship with the girl (anymore). I'd love to get some insight on this though, even though I’m aware no two people think exactly alike.

I met a nice girl at an internship of sorts, we are both college students. I was happy to find that she was a very pleasant person. It looked like she enjoyed talking to me, we really clicked. The strange part was that she is much more attractive as a woman than I am as a man IMO (but just like anyone, I can't realistically rate my appearance).
She did mention she had a boyfriend, but I invited her to the cinema despite that since I really enjoyed her company, she was a very fun person.
The next day my internship ended and I was going to the seaside. I sent her a short text saying good luck with the rest of her internship and that I enjoyed the movie. To my surprise, she immediately replied with a text, saying she enjoyed herself too, but as she had a boyfriend, she would like to stay just friends (a bit strange, I didn’t remember making any moves). 
But of course, that was logical, and I thought nothing of it, I wasn't really desperate anyway.

Fast forward two months, I invite her for coffee. I realized afterwards that she was now single (FB is weird isn't it) and proceeded to invite her two more times to the cinema. She wasn't making any suggestions, and as i was swamped with studying I couldn't find the energy to man up and tell her I am growing to like her a lot.

Then suddenly in February she invites me to her birthday. This was completely unexpected. I went clubbing with her and her best friend. Again, nothing from me or her. I decided she wasn't interested in me. As I had nothing to lose though, I invited her a month later for coffee. I told her I've fallen in love with her. She replies by saying that I am more than a friend to her and that my chances with her aren't bad at all, but that she cannot guarantee anything (or something in this manner, you can imagine I was pretty nervous). I said it was OK with, me, I won't be offended if we just stay friends. 

After I got home she sent me a text repeating that my chances with her aren’t bad because she values me as a person - that maybe we should hang out a bit more often and ‘see what happens’.

We meet two days later. I act as usual, as I didn’t want to push it. We drank some drinks, walked through town and talked. The usual. We part before shortly before midnight. I send her two texts, one before I go to sleep, and the next one in the morning, mostly talking about when we should meet next. Yes, the second text contained pretty much the same content. I was curious because she didn’t reply to the first one.

Now for the kicker;
The next day, out of the blue, she sends me a text saying she is actually still feeling love for an ex, even though she knows he was a bad person. She says she feels I am more like a brother to her. I am supposed to be her ideal, and her mind says yes, but her heart belongs to the ex (I am aware of how strange this sounds) - the obligatory it’s not you, it’s me comment was included.. I was a bit disappointed with that, obviously, but said I understand.
I didn’t really contact her for the next two months, I was afraid my response would be too emotional.

This week, I see her at the university and we chat for a while. I can’t deny it was fun to talk to her again, she is an interesting person, but as I crossed an emotional line, I decided not to contact her after that. 

Today, she sends me a text saying it was really fun to talk to me on Monday. She would like us to do it more often (if that’s OK with me).

And now you see why I am confused. Did I do something wrong? Is she trying to get something from me? Was she ever actually attracted to me (there are easier ways to get free drinks than to talk to a guy for three hours, mind you)? I know you probably don’t have enough data, but it would be cool if some of you ladies could at least point me in the right direction, by my actions you can probably see that I'm not very good with this. 

Feel free to ask for more info on anything.

I realize that doesn't sound like much, but the EU Stagiares (interns) have a lot more insight and responsibility here than any other workplace I've been in. I'm also a huge policy dork, so there's a lot I can answer about the EU off the top of my head that doesn't relate to the work on my desk.

If you want an AMA from a ""real"" Eurocrat, I can always bounce questions off my coworkers. Most of them are mid-30s and use a computer just for work and email so they won't be doing it themselves. I can also pull questions I can't answer and get one of the interns in the European Parliament or the European Commission to get me in touch with someone there.

AMA about the EU, Eurozone crisis, the internship, money, policy, money, life in Brussels, internal &amp; international politics, what it's like to be the only real english speaker in a directorate that conducts business in the language, money, my favourite movies, etc. Did I mention money?

I won't answer questions about stuff that's not entirely public domain (budgets or policies we're still drawing up, for example), but that's very little of what happens here anyways.

EDIT: Don't be afraid to get political. I wanted to do this because half of reddit seems to have a huge hate-on for the EU and the non-European bunch thinks it's just a glorified chess club for bureaucrats.

EDIT 2: I've got a meeting, so I have to step out. I'll continue when I'm done running the world.

EDIT 3: I can't really complain about the nightlife in Brussels. I'm back, but its been a long week and I need to sleep sooner or later.

I've been out of a job for quite some time. Laid off in 2008. I've been in school for this whole time pursing marketing and recently came across a rather awesome opportunity to intern for a major visual-tech company. 

I landed an interview, aced it, followed with an email and a phone call...the feedback I was given was that my interview went ""very very well"" and my presentation was ""excellent."" I was told that, ""You are the number one candidate."" Mind you all this for an $8 dollar an hour Mon-Fri, 8 hour a day internship. So, all this is great news to know that I was the first to be interviewed for this position and that the interview went well. Thursday I find out that they are calling my professional references, so to me, this is another good sign. Things are moving forward. 

Friday comes and on this day, I was told that they would have finalized who they want for the position. Of course things are looking good for me or so I thought. I get a phone call towards the end of Friday from the company, I excitingly pick up the phone only to hear, ""Unfortunately, we have decided to go with someone else because they have internship experience and they've done it twice before.""

What in the hell is ""internship experience?"" Isn't the whole point behind an internship to gain experience, so why hire someone who has done it twice before, why doesn't this person not have a full time job by now? 

Super bummed about it. I really needed this. Is there something else going on here? I don't understand...

Am I right in thinking this is a little odd? Anyone else go through something similar? 

EDIT: I'm not trying to be some complainer talking about how I didn't land this job, but more so the implications of how strange it is. I understand that there are tons of people out there right now in the market looking for a job and that such a thing I went through happens everyday to said people, but in this case I really did just feel it was strange. 

EDIT: Forgot to mention that this was a 2-3 Month internship. There was no absolute promise of going full time/salary after the internship period, however it was mentioned to me that they didn't want whoever is hired to simply just disappear and that they would attempt to find a position within the company that one could full-fill.

A little bit of background: I recently finished my third year of chemical engineering, I have a 3.32 GPA, roughly 1 year and a half of research in nuclear energy processes, about to have my name mentioned on a 2nd publication (2nd author on the 1st pub), and am currently working at an internship this summer.

So I'm at a bit of a dilemma. I'm not sure if I should apply for schools this fall or head directly into the industry.

At the same time, I'm thankful for the internship because I'm seeing how industry is like. However, all of the employees I've spoken to have recommended getting at least a M.S to have stronger job security.

Here's the deal:

* Goal: Create a database of all case records (client list, about 2,000 records) by adding invoice data to each record.

* Current data: (1) MS Excel file of all clients, with basic contact and budget code data. (2) Physical file folders for each client, containing the invoices that need to be added to the electronic client records.

* My boss wants a database for all of the records that can be accessed, viewed, analyzed, and updated either (1) via the web (128 bit SSL encryption, password-protected); or, (2) via a shared network drive. I have no idea why we would need it accessible via the web, but he wants proposals for both options.

* I have a team of 5 summer interns who will have the job of updating all the records in the database. They are minimally skilled and minimally-trained, so the database will need to be extremely idiot-proof, so they cannot enter errant values in the record fields they update. There are about 75-100 individual fields that to be added to each record (or less, depending on how many invoices are associated with each record).

* I will have the job of using the updated record data to generate reports and to generate individual case data sheets for auditors.

The web-based database and web-form sites seem good in terms of ease of use and security, but none seem to allow a user to import existing data and then use web forms to update the imported records. 

The options I have come up with so far are: (1) create an MS Access database that the interns can access and update via the shared network drive; (2) Create a set of online web forms (e.g., Wufoo.com) for the interns to plug in the new data, then export it to an Excel sheet to use to update the existing spreadsheet; (3) Contract someone to build a custom web client that can be used by the interns to update the records.

I have a deadline of only a few days to figure out the best solution, and only a week or so to get it up and running. What do you think is the best way to go? Are there better solutions?"

I am young and inexperienced for the most part, but they were impressed enough with the single site I've been updating for months since I got into web design/dev that they decided to hire me on as an intern as more of a learning experience.

While that site looks relatively nice and modern after a big redesign two months ago, I have a bit of trouble coding websites that don't look ""like Windows '95"". I've been practicing a bit so I can get used to the fundamentals of creating a modern site from scratch in one shot, but it's pretty tough.

What sort of advice can you give me that will aid me in this? Or could you recommend a book in particular? I want to design sites that impress them and clients - that opens up the door for being hired as a paid worker. I have no problem with working hard, but I just need to get the hang of producing modern looking, ""pretty"" sites.

Thanks! "

Here's a list of _all_ postings. Some of these hirings are still available.  Please submit anything you know of.

Redditor Advantage: I think that some of these companies just throw resumes in a pile and pick at random. If you're an employee at the company, you could quite possibly help out redditors by 'referring' them as friends.  This isn't nepotism, companies do referrals all the time, and often give current employees bonuses for hired referrals.  I think many consider other redditors their friends, so this is A-OK.  Besides, don't other forums do this?

EDIT: Dave816am has [a good point](http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/i9vbf/this_week_in_jobs_for_june_26_2011/c222guz), don't refer people you don't know. Maybe talk to the person a little.

Reddit, I'm desperate to clean [the bathroom](http://imgur.com/a/i2wgV). I'm living in this house for the summer, and it's goddam gross. The house was built in 1973, and I don't think anything's been re-done since. 

The current owner lives there year-round and 3 of us interns are living with him this summer. Granted, we're leaving in about a month or so, but I can't stand going to that bathroom any longer.

One of the roommates and I already tried cleaning the floor with some solution and a mop, but that barely worked. There's like piss stains along the edge of the floor with hair and it's GODDAM IMPOSSIBLE to remove.

I heard vinegar was a good solution?!?!? I don't even know what type of flooring it is, maybe laminated flooring? 

I don't even know where the black stripes are from...

Please help. There's sticky spots, piss stains, possibly 30+ year old hair on the floor...

I met him at a Reddit meetup and he was really into me. I was extremely excited that after so long, someone actually likes me back so I began to date him. Everything was lovely and felt like a dream come true. He is funny, intelligent but not so clever at times. He would introduce me to books, movies, tv series and so on. My interest on him grew more and more.

After the next few months, I've started to feel like I'm having a crush on him. This sounds very strange. It's the same old feeling I had all these years when I failed at getting a response from guys I like and I was afraid to call him, to talk to him all day because I want to be the perfect girlfriend. That problem was fixed after my best friend urged me to express my feelings. He said it's fine, don't worry and I am amazing as I am. 

Between we started dating and now, different events happened that made me worse than I felt before.  It started with a phone call. He told me he hasn't talked to a good friend for a while so he's going to do that. The person called first and I noticed the particular ringtone for the friend. It's a friend, just let him talk, I mean, I'll do that if it's an old friend I haven't talked to a long time. After hours, he came back with a pissed off face. I didn't want to bother him or cause him trouble so I didn't say anything, but he finally told me that he was talking to his ex and she already has a new boyfriend. He can't believe that she moved on so soon. Inside I felt extremely hurt, even though I wouldn't understand how a person feels about their ex, but the feeling that he is doing the exact thing he's angry about and disregarding me is really hurtful. I didn't do anything about that time.

My curiosity got the best of me after that and was bored one day to go on his facebook profile to understand bits and pieces of his past. I understand it's a stalker-ish thing to do, so I did not tell him about this. I got the name of the ex that he was talking about earlier and I also got the reason why they broke up. She is still in college and lives a couple of states away from he is so it was a hassle to get to her. One day he drove to visit her but because of terrible weather he has gotten himself into an accident thus, ending the relationship because of the distance. 

After that I tried to put it behind my head and continue my days. My love for him grew bigger and bigger and I wouldn't even have such feelings on other men. He has his flaws but he is well-rounded and is a kind of person that I would love to be with for a very very long time. I have classes during weekdays and everyday, I'm always looking forward to Friday the most because that's the day I visit him and stay with him for the weekend. I love the lazy days we spend lying on the couch relaxing and I also love the days when we go out and do fun activities or walk around the park. 

There were a couple of times we went to meetups at the bar and I get drunk. I would tell him how much I love him and I would sometimes accidentally tell him that in my mother tongue. He would always tell me, he ""likes"" me, he likes me a lot. It kind of bothered me at times. He would explain that he says ""love"" only when he means it and the only woman he ever loved was someone he dated for 3 years. When he explains it like that it saddened me and I would rather he not say anything at all. Sometimes if I were very drunk, I would cry when he says that and he would quiet me down by saying he loves me too. 

These were the build-ups for me, but what triggered me were two events. They might sounds minor and silly to consider as a big deal, but it's always on my mind. The first when we were shopping for furniture and he was calling me from afar but he called me by his ex's name. At that time, he didn't know that I know who his ex was yet. The second time was when I was on the meetup group page and I was just skimming through to see which ones I should go. I noticed in the newsfeed that there was a familiar name. It was her. In her introduction, she says that she will visit where we are during the summer for her internship. This alerted me so much I became worried and cried often. My best friend urged me again to confront my boyfriend if I wanted to solve this problem. After being timid and nervous for days, I finally did when we went to a bar again. 

I chose that day because I noticed if I get tipsy enough, I would be able to speak my mind and not be afraid. We went to get pizza as an intermission during the meetup and I finally told him. I told him all my worries and the two things that triggered me. The downside to my courage juice is that it also makes me cry easier. I felt scared again when I started tearing up while telling him because my dad told me that women shouldn't cry and crying would show her weaknesses and how vulnerable she is. He was very surprised how I know his ex's name. He then started telling me he can't help it and how much he still loves her. He says that if he needed to choose between her and me, he would choose both, how they promised they will be together 3 years later when she graduates if they're both single. I can't remember what happened next because I was crying too hard. 

It was fine for another few months until summer, I am now on my summer vacation and I got an internship. My best friend/roommate is leaving the country until August so I'll be all alone. I thought staying with my boyfriend would be nice because it would be more convenient for me to go to my internship office and no more loneliness. Fast forward to recent weeks, he went out twice for dinner with a ""friend"" the second time, the night before his ex called him thus I suspect it was probably dinner with her. I didn't say anything until one weekend when he was writing his retirement plans documents and under the benefactor or something (sorry, I don't really understand it) he fills in his ex's name and stuff. I became depressed all over again. He talked on the phone with her for a very long time until I went into the room with finished laundries. He noticed I was crying and I told him why. He kept on apologizing, how much he doesn't deserve me, how terrible he was and how pathetic he is that he can't cut off ties with his ex. I didn't say much. He says he was overwhelmed when I moved in for summer and so on. I understand my problem. I asked him if his ex, who has a boyfriend, feels the same way about him, he says he doesn't know.

The next few days was awkward. We went to another bar meetup and I got a bit tipsy again. I told him I was hungry and didn't eat all day, so we both left to get food. Along the way, he brought up our problem again. He starts to admit, he said, he can't see me being with him in the future married with kids. I started bawling on the streets. I asked him if he could see that with his ex. He says he can. I was very angry because seeing such things in the future just means he's dwelling in the past. He's unfairly comparing me, that he dated for 6 months to a person whom he dated for 3 years. It really hurts me a lot.  I cried so hard I couldn't stand straight. I told him I've lost all appetite and might vomit so we went back to his place. He complains that he wants to be married, have kids, and so on, but the problem is I've never discussed with him about my view on these! How would he know I'm not a children person?! How would he know I don't want to get married some day?! I calmed down a bit and he comforts me by telling me how amazing I am, what a good life I have and all the nonsense I hate hearing that doesn't solve our problem. He then told me another of our problem is that we have nothing in common. For 6 months, nothing in common? What an excuse, such bullshit.

In the end, after all the advice I got from my dad and my best friend, I still wanted to be with him. I asked him if he would give me a shot to let me change his mind and his ""future"" that he sees. He didn't refuse it but he became even more distant and cold to me each day. I am too stubborn and blinded by love that I am not going to break up with him. Sorry this was so long, but I thought writing in my blog where no one reads wouldn't help me and redditors would give me some good advice, or just inspiring comments to boost my confidence. (Sorry in advance if wording or grammar is strange, English is my second language)

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend still can't get his ex out of his head. Can't see me with him in the future married to him with kids. He is an ass and I'm an idiot that is too stubborn and love him too much to break up with him. "

I'm probably going to make a couple of dinners for them. I also may get them some gifts. They have 3 kids; two boys (10 and 13) and a girl (15). The youngest is really into handiwork/building shit and into sports. The 13 year old is also into sports, and big into the boy scouts. The eldest likes to sing, and read. I was thinking a watch for the dad, and an alox swiss army knife for the 13 year old. not sure about the others yet. 

What else can I do to show my appreciation for how nice they've been to me?

i9pm6,10,2011-06-26,Where do I go from here?,linksyswrt54g,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i9pm6/where_do_i_go_from_here/,"I'm 24, she's 22.  We've been dating for almost three years now.  We started dating when we were both in college, I'd been having a dry spell and I met her through some friends.  We hit it off.  She is beautiful, charming, intelligent, and funny.  

We continued to date after I graduated and moved about an hour away to get a job.  She did a semester abroad and we ""broke things off"" despite Skyping almost every day, and I went to visit her.  This seemed to rekindle things, as I was in love with this girl.  She came back from Europe and we continued to date, with lots of travel and a few rough patches.

She graduated the following spring, and moved about 4 hours away from me for an internship, having no luck finding a job.  The stress of her commute and financial situation took its toll on us, and I couldn't take it any more.  Every phone conversation started with, ""Oh my God.. this day is terrible.. you wouldn't believe what happened to me..""  I tried to be compassionate and helpful, but I really ran out of steam.  I told her that I couldn't handle my stress and her stress anymore, and that I didn't want to be together anymore. We didn't speak to eachother for a few months.

She got a better paying internship and was able to move closer to it, eliminating her commute.  We got to talking over the holidays and I apologized and we wound up going on a trip together.  Everything was great, and it was like nothing had happened.  She was in the process of getting a new apartment and internship and seemed like everything was pointing in the right direction.  Conversations were cheerful and bright, and the future looked good again.

She finally got an interview for a full time job, but this time on the other side of the country.  She's now a 5 hour flight from me.  She's disenchanted with the job, her apartment, her lack of friends, and her lack of anything to ""do"" in the evenings (she's never really been one to have any hobbies).  Our phone calls have returned to her rattling off a list of things that are going terrible in her life (no friends, overweight, hate my job, etc).

I'm across the country, and this is bogging me down.  Am I a jerk?  I try to help her out by being constructive and trying to help her find things to do.  She enjoys swimming, so I suggested that (no way!  too much money for suit/goggles/gym membership), okay what about a bike club (do you know how expensive bikes are?!).

I really don't know how to handle this anymore.  I'm flying out to visit her in a week, but she tells me she ""isn't excited to see me"" because she's so down in the dumps.

I know there are a lot of ins and outs with this story, and I'll gladly fill in details where necessary.  I feel like I used to love this girl, but between distance and her inability to cope with things on her own I'm growing increasingly stressed.

TL;DR:  I've dated a girl for a long time and she's now living really far away from me.  She's unhappy about her new job/lack of friends/general low self esteem.  What do I do?  It's dragging down my life and with the situation as it is, I don't intend to move to her, or vice versa."
i9pc3,15,2011-06-26,Help! Chemical Engineer unsure of going into industry or graduate school (x-posted in engineering),uciseal,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/i9pc3/help_chemical_engineer_unsure_of_going_into/,"Hey Reddit,

A little bit of background: I recently finished my third year of chemical engineering, I have a 3.32 GPA, roughly 1 year and a half of research in nuclear energy processes, about to have my name mentioned on a 2nd publication (2nd author on the 1st pub), and am currently working at an internship this summer. I'll be taking the GRE at the end of this summer.

So I'm at a bit of a dilemma. I'm not sure if I should apply for schools this fall or head directly into the industry. The reason why I'm holding back on applying for graduate school is primarily due to my lackluster GPA, yet I still have some hope because of the research that I've been doing. At the same time, I'm thankful for the internship because I'm seeing how industry is like. However, all of the employees I've spoken to have recommended getting at least a M.S to have stronger job security.

Let me know what you think!

edit1/ I'm going to apply to 10-12 schools and go directly for Ph.D. I'll update with the schools after I do preliminary research on what groups interest me."

I graduated with a BA last May, and since then I've been working just to pay the rent. However, in February I decided that I wasn't going to be a 9-to-5 retail drone, and quit my job. I've been living off my savings - which aren't substantial, but enough to keep me housed, clothed and comfortable. 


In April, I got two great opportunities in my field: one as an intern and one as the head of a large creative project. The only problem is, they're both unpaid. I accepted both. But, alas, I need money.


I currently have two job options: 


1. A receptionist at a medium-sized business unrelated to anything I'm interested in, but allowing me to continue doing both my internship and my artistic project. (Pay level, acceptable. Enough to pay the bills, but not save.)


2. A full-time job in a different city working for an NPO that helps arts organizations get funding. (Pay level, quite handsome. Enough to save up for ""real life"" later on.)

I've worked at Best Buy for the past two years as a seasonal/ocassional.  In other words I come in and work over the summers and during my breaks when I'm home, I'm a college student and I go to school over an hour away.  It's been nice for extra spending money and what not.  So this summer I have a great internship where I'm working 40 hours a week, making double what I make at BB, and have way better working conditions.  I've also been working weekends at BB 8 hours on both Saturday and Sunday, it's quite a bit of work but I really like having money so it is worth it to me.  But after today I think I'm fed up.  I sell computers, which I absolutely love, I enjoy finding great deals for people on stuff they actually need.  I'll spend hours with a customer if they are friendly and willing to learn.  Today I didn't sell a single computer which I don't really care I'm not on commission and I sold other things but I missed out on getting 5 different customers the computers that they wanted because of the incompetence of the system at BB.  On top of working with an incompetent system I'm always over worked my shift is always understaffed.  I can count the number of 15 minute breaks I've had while at best buy using 2 fingers.  The reason my shift is always understaffed is because I sell more and help more customers than anyone else.  In other words they count me as two workers.  I also have proof for this because they recently started tracking sales and out of a 12 person department I make up 17% of the revenue.  I've never received a raise, even after asking 2 separate ocassions, because I'm ""seasonal/ocassional and don't qualify for the same raises everyone else does"". 

So I've never quit a job before what should I say?  I have to be in to work in 7 hours and I have my complete and total pick of managers to go talk to.

But they put me in a situation with a lot of pressure without real training.

 So I start there and they put me in charge of a team to do outside jobs. The team consist of me and an intern that knows nothing usefull ( because he just started his course) So I do the jobs the best I can with what knowledge I have but every time there is something wrong I get shit at.

 Today they put me with a new machine that isn't much user friendly and I never used before. So they get one guy on the phone that gives me basic basic information for 15 minutes. I go and try to do my job but realized that the machine is all set wrong. Go back to the office tell em I can't do shit with this they tell me oh wait we will get someone on the phone to explain how it works. Which turns out the guy doesn't know how to fix what I'm asking about.

 I tell em : NO its not by phone thats going to help me out I need a training with someone that knows how to operate 
it for atleast a day but they don't want to do that.
 So I just left and said I can't work under those conditions.

Now my questions is should I go back and say I don't want to be in charge for the outside jobs but I wouldn't mind staying for office jobs while I get a new job? Or should I just screw it and never look back?

TLDR Finished school got a job they put me in charge of a team which consist of me and an intern. No training on new machine so got pissed off and tired of not getting any help or training so I just left

Reddit, how did you decide what you wanted to be when you grow up?",lawschooldropout12,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/iap1h/i_think_im_quitting_law_school_and_i_have_no_idea/,"I'm having a little bit of an existential crisis right now; I graduated college with a degree in Political Science and started law school right away. I had this idea of working in human rights; traveling to different countries and helping victims of human rights abuses while working for the UN or NGOs or something to that effect, and maybe running for some type of political office here in the United States at some point. Obviously, I was (maybe still am) extremely naive. I wound up getting an internship in a political campaign and found out that 90% of it is asking for people's money or endorsement, neither of which I'm particularly fond of nor comfortable with. I also joined the local fire department at around the same time. So I started law school disillusioned with the idea of going to law school and spending a lot of my time at the fire department instead. In addition to this, I also got hired as an EMT in a large metropolitan fire department on the East Coast, which I started a few days after my classes ended (but before my finals). Needless to say, I've finished my first year of law school with spectacularly low grades. 

So now I'm at somewhat of an impasse; law school wasn't that preferable to me from the get-go, but at least it was something that I had going for me. Being an EMT in the 911 system is fun for now, but it's certainly not a career. Getting onto the fire side and becoming a firefighter is something I'm definitely interested, but it's far from guaranteed and I've seen people wait a decade, never get on, and by then it's too late.

So that's basically where I am right now. So I'm wondering how you decided what you wanted to do; was it a conscious decision or did you just kind of fall into it? Are you doing it now, or are you still trying to achieve it? Did you get what you thought you wanted and realized it wasn't for you? Any advice for those willing to offer it would be sincerely and gratefully appreciated.

TL;DR: Stopping law school, starting as an EMT with a major city's fire department, it's not a career, don't know what to do. How did you figure out what you wanted to do for a living?"

I am looking for an entry level Environmental Engineering position that will help me work towards a P.E. certification. I have already taken and passed the F.E. exam.

I recently graduated with distinction in Environmental Systems Engineering and Applied Spanish, with a minor in International Studies. I had a pretty stellar GPA, and wrote my honors thesis on Biodiesel fuels. I studied abroad twice, and read, speak, and write Spanish comfortably.

My technical classes focused on air pollution, atmospheric dispersion, and renewable energies, but I have a solid backing in all the areas of environmental engineering (soils, water treatment, remediation).

I have relevant work experience, two internships in environmental offices for very well known corporations, international business experience, and I have worked abroad as a translator.

I'm currently located in the northeast, but ready and willing to relocate as necessary. Please PM me know if you'd like a look at my resume.

Oh, I'm also an Eagle Scout, ex-competitive skateboarder, woodworker, and a rockin' and blusin' guitarist. I believe in being a well rounded person."

Anyways, I've heard employers rarely check up to make sure work experience is 'legit' (particularly when apps don't require references), and even so, it may be possible to reference a small company that has gone under, or has a website I put up, or I give my friend's phone number, etc etc.

If I commit a solid effort toward being able to 'describe my experience', would I be able to get away with something like this? Obviously no technical experience could be faked, but I'm pretty sure a lot of internships (non-engineering/CS anyways) don't teach you anything you can't learn in a week on the job + google. I realize of course this would overall be called a bad idea, but I'm getting tired of rejection despite feeling qualified for the entry level jobs to which I'm applying.

I interned at a law firm last summer, a paid internship by the way, and learned about all the nitty gritty details of how a firm works.  I spent 8 hours a day 6 days a week filing, entering info into the computer, running the mail room, helping attorneys with random tasks, etc. for an entire summer.  This summer, I signed up for a program my university puts on in which a coordinator set me up at an unpaid internship in Washington, D.C.  The program is pretty expensive, and I signed up believing I'd have this invaluable experience and come out with some solid rec letters and knowledge about what lawyers actually do.  As it turns out, the firm has never had an intern and truly has no idea what to do with me.  I'm leaning absolutely nothing and doing absolutely nothing.  They occassionally give me tasks but from what I can tell those tasks are unnecessary and of no help whatsoever to the employees (e.g. writing down all the files in an office even though the firm already has a list detailing which files are in which office).  It's more like they feel bad and just want to give me something to do so I don't just sit in a corner all day.  I talked to my supervisor who said she'd try to find me some projects to get started on, but it's been three weeks and I've still done/learned nothing.  At this point, I'd even be happy just to file papers.  I'm trying very hard to stay positive, but I've now spent a month sitting at a desk counting the seconds until six o'clock hits.  I ask if anyone in the office needs help with anything pretty often (I try to restrain myself from asking too much because I don't want to be that annoying intern), but everyone keeps telling me they don't have anything for me to do.  I'm at a loss here reddit, and I need your help.

As an undergrad entering my junior year, I'm trying to decide which field of accounting to solidify myself in. Here's my perspective on things: I'm doing an unpaid tax internship at Rolling Stone right now that will end in August. Back before I got the internship, my initial plan was to get one tax internship and one auditing internship, so I can get a feel for both fields and pick which one I liked best. Overall, I am enjoying myself at the tax internship. I'm still getting used to sitting at a desk for 8 hours, but if I knew what I was doing (the company took me as an intern knowing I had no tax experience) and was given more intensive projects, it's certainly something I can see myself getting into. Now I never saw myself getting into tax, because it seems like the partners at the auditing firms, and employees at the Big 4 firms in general, are the ones that get all the recognition and better job advancement opportunities (not to mention a larger paycheck). But lately, a lot of people have been telling me to stay in tax, that working at a Big 4 is like working 2 jobs. And now that I'm looking at my university's eRecruiting website, it would be easy and practical for me to get a paid tax internship in the fall, which would be great, because money is tight right now. So I guess I'd just like some outside perspectives on this...if you could pick either field, which would you pick and why? Do tax accountants have considerable advancement opportunities comparable to those of auditors? Is the hard work that's allegedly associated with starting out at a Big 4 firm worth it? Any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks."

Before that, my current job required me to be at the office with irregular hours, sometimes late into the evening past midnight. My job before that had me stay in the office until 10PM every night. Before that, I was a full-time student holding two jobs and two internships, etc. I don't know if this is typical for some redditors out there, but it's really wearing me down. The biggest reason why I'm starting to really get affected by it is my realization that I've been working since I was 14 and sacrificed a lot in the process. I'm 24 now, and I wonder if I've been letting my youth go by and allowing my social life to completely disintegrate.

By default, I've been drawn to working long hours, and an 80 hour work week is nothing short of normal for me for most jobs I've held. The jobs run a gamut of pretty high intensity political organizing to food service bussing, but I'm starting to get tired of hustling all the time... Financially, it is necessary, but I wonder if I can get by on doing less. Maybe I'm just a masochist by nature.

I place a strong priority on friendships, but I've turned down so many invitations to hang out due to work that my friends have given up. They were the only things that made me feel sane and now I spend what little free time I have with my boyfriend. He's great, but he can only do so much... I've forced myself to work out and take care of my health when I can, giving up my lunch breaks to go to the gym, but I'm so exhausted all the time. I haven't seen my family in months, even though they live an hour away by public transportation. 

Is this generally how your life progresses after you graduate college and become a professional? Should I just submit to the inevitability of solitude? All I want is to have a reasonable amount of predictable free time. I'm so jealous of people who have a weekend routine and read a newspaper and take a leisurely Sunday walk. Do things get better? 

I apologize in advance if I sounded really whiny or completely out of touch with reality. I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice on how to deal with my situation or if I'm just seeing if there is anyone else who can relate, but thanks so much for hearing me out nonetheless. 

**EDIT:** TwoX, you guys are amazing as usual. Thank you so much for the helpful advice and the warm encouragement. I'm definitely going to reevaluate my priorities and strive towards creating a more sustainable work-life balance. I have a job interview coming up in a week. It involves a significant pay increase which will allow me to drop my second job. I've also heard great things about working there. Wish me luck!"

I have no job, no friends, no lasting hobby and I'm mooching off my girlfriend's parents. I feel guilty about that last one. Unbelievably, incredibly guilty.

I sit around all day and just eat food, watch TV and go on reddit. 

I want to get a job to at least show her parents that I'm not a useless sack of shit, but it's the old catch-22: need experience for a job, need jobs for experience. The only job experience I have is working in IT at my university for 7 months.

My goal right now is to intern somewhere, but I have almost zero skills to put on my resume. There is a TED talk about ""if you have to put Microsoft Office on your resume, you've got no marketable skills."" 

Guess what's on my resume? Well, mostly I put that there for two reasons. One, I've been sending it out to crappy menial office jobs and internships, who I imagine aren't expecting the highest quality applicants. And two, because I actually *am* highly skilled in the programs because one of my course requirements was a class on them.  Of course, when everybody else puts ""highly proficient in MS Office"" on their resume as well, it lumps me in with those people who are lying.


But those are office jobs and I'm probably getting my hopes too high. I should be aiming for shitty retail jobs or something, and I am. But I'm not even so much as being called in for an interview for the ones I've applied to.

Hell, one of the jobs I applied to was a fast food place that was looking for a quick hire and they didn't even want an application. They just had me write down my name and number on a piece of paper and said they'd get back to me, and there were only a few names on the paper. I didn't get a call.

And who's to blame them? It's an employer's market -- they have their pick of the litter. Even McDonald's has their choice of anybody they want between a drunk, homeless guy to a Hardvard graduate.

I want a job of some sort but I dunno where the hell to go. Everyone on /r/jobs says the best way to get jobs is through connections. I don't know *anybody* working anywhere even remotely close to my field. Actually, I don't know anybody, period. I know some people working at Target and others working at a grocery store. That's it, literally.

I'm stuck. It's got me a bit depressed because I hate being inactive all the time. It makes me feel completely useless. If I could even get so much as an *interview*, even if I failed, it would boost my morale.

Bleh."

I am a very humble person who is going to school to learn, and am open to a position in any field as long as it will give me experience that will further my education.

For example, in engineering companies the gender ratio is very distorted with men making up the majority of the workforce. I imagine this is because more men *want* to be engineers and hence go to university to study engineering. This means that there are more men to choose from and therefore, the quality of the top tier graduates will be significantly higher than the quality of the top tier female graduates. This is not to say that women are not good at engineering or not as skilled so please don't take offence.

As companies will logically employ the best people, the majority of the engineering company should be male, and rightly so. But in order to appear non-sexist (which it already is not), it discriminates against men in order to attempt to equalize the gender ratio. Presented with an equally skilled male and female graduate, I think that engineering companies would prefer to hire the female graduate. I have no actual proof of this except anecdotal evidence during my internship at ARUP, where I found seven women in an office of thirty people, two of which were receptionists. Is this fair? Has society gone to too great a length to ensure there is no discrimination within the workforce that we have to discriminate against those who had not been discriminated against before?

**Tl;dr** I think that we just hire people to make the company look better and not actually function better."
ibl8e,0,2011-06-28,Reddit- help me understand what Graduate School program I want to get in to.,ScarletJew72,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ibl8e/reddit_help_me_understand_what_graduate_school/,"**Quick summary:** Graduated with a B.A. in Journalism in 2010 and I can't even land an interview. A 3.0 GPA with one semester's length of an internship obviously isn't as attractive as my competition's resumes. 

I'll admit we didn't go over much grammar in school, just writing styles. Although I can write well, I believe my lack of truly sophisticated grammar presents another disadvantage as compared to my competition. I want to start applying to grad schools to improve my writing style, but I'm confused as to what program is best for me.

I've looked at University of Maryland's programs and here's what I found:

[Creative Writing:](http://www.gradschool.umd.edu/catalog/programs/crwr.htm) Pretty much exactly what I'm looking for, but I don't want to write stories or poems. Just the news and non-fiction.

[English Language and Literature:](http://www.gradschool.umd.edu/catalog/programs/engl.htm) Looks more of a history of literature program than actual writing skills.

[Linguistics:](http://www.gradschool.umd.edu/catalog/programs/ling.htm) Seems to focus on research about communication instead of actually learning about the written language (I see that I would need a Bachelor's or Master's to apply for UMD, but maybe not for another school).

So, which category is better suited for my interests? Are there other programs that I don't realize exists?

**EDIT-** Please don't tell me not to go into this field. Not only is this what I want to do, but I know how to get my foot in the door...I just don't have the credentials to do so at this time."

I'm working an internship at my university for some mechanical engineers (i'm an EE student) and my supervisor has asked me some questions regarding the batteries.  [This](http://www.amazon.com/Odyssey-PC625-Powersports-Battery/dp/B0000BYEXO) is the battery we're working with.  The project is making an unmanned boat, so two fo these go on the boat and it sucks a ton of power out of them.  They've had some for a couple of years and others are brand new.  So I have a few questions:

If two of the batteries, roughly the same age, start around the same voltage, (about 11.8) and one declines to 8 in about an hour using a small motor (taking about 1.8 amps) and the other declines at a much slower rate, is the faster declining one definitely worse?  She seems to think that they hold a certain charge for a certain amount of time and then just go down, whereas I think they fall a bit more linearly than that.  For that reason she thinks that the battery that fell 4 volts in an hour might still be as good as the one that started at the same voltage roughly (within .1 of a volt) the same, and that they just weren't charge close enough together.

2. When charging them, the charger has two settings, a slow charge (2 amp) and a higher (12 amp) setting.  Is it bad to use the higher setting?  I read online that since they're 18 amp hour batteries it's not good to charge them that fast, you're only supposed to charge them at max a third of the total amp hour setting.

3.  She more or less wants me to test how long these batteries should last, rank them worst to best (i think theres about 7), what the setting does.  Do you guys have any good advice on the best way to do this besides just measuring voltage as it discharges over time?

Thanks guys!"

Hello:  
  
My name is Christopher Woodall. You killed my father. Just kidding :D, unless you did. Then prepare to die. I saw that you had a few job openings, but I am unsure where I would fit in. Because of this I have [attached my resume](http://www.christopherwoodall.com/resume/) and will give you a brief run-down about my self.  
  
First I take it you would like to know some of my past work experience. Well, I got into the wrong major in college, Criminal Justice; thought I'd end up as a Game Warden or... well really don't know what I was thinking. I started out as an electronics sales person at AAFES, a retail outlet on military bases. This wasn't taking me exactly where I wanted so I moved to Italy and worked as a house keeper in a hotel. This was nice but the cost of living was just too much thusly moved back to the US. Keep in mind, all the while attending and trying to pay for college. I ended up in Tennessee working as a horticulturist in a small family-owned-and-operated green house until school started back that fall. My last job was as an intern at the local District Attorney's Office working on murder and theft cases; interviewing witnesses, police officers, ect.  
  
There was still something eating at me. My love for computers and technology; one day I hope to be assimilated into the borg. Because of this I decided to teach my self to program. I started with [Python](http://www.christopherwoodall.com/gmail.py), moved to [PHP](http://yourfaceonatshirt.com), then [Javascript](http://www.christopherwoodall.com/map ""Only works in firefox, needs refactoring.""). Still don't know as much as I'd like but I am getting close. I was always interested in computer security so I worked my ass off to get into Google Corporate Hall of Fame for application security; check it out, I'm in there!
  
What I am really asking for is a steady paycheck and a place to grow. Shoot, I'd be happy working as a janitor solving problems on a chalk board if someone would hire me. I am a self starter and motivated to do something with this short time I have. 23 now, take it I'll live to about 60, so I am already a third of the way through life! If you give me a chance it will not be wasted.  
  
Respectfully submitted,

He's managed to at least hide his smoking well but he's definitely slowed down a lot by sheer force of will but he really wants to quit, and he's completely against the e-cigs, he doesn't want to just switch habits. So, ex-smokers, how did you bring yourself to quit?

TL/DR: my dad's been smoking for 50 years, been trying to quit for maybe 10, what are some real ways people have quit?"

UGH. Even if I take the October LSAT, do I have hope with this decrease in my score? Would law schools even care if I mention my health issues? I haven't even figured out exactly what caused them and doctors have been saying different things.

And please, please, please, I know there will be those here who say ""just forget law school, waste of time and money, etc"" but just allow me to decide that for myself in a little while, alright? I just...need some help envisioning what to do for the immediate future. A little distraught and heartbroken here.

More background if it helps: Harvard undergrad, c/o 2010, shitty 3.2 GPA in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, 1 year left of a Master of Environmental Management degree at Duke (decent GPA so far but not that it matters), and currently doing a summer law-based environmental internship in Washington DC dealing with hydraulic fracturing issues (pretty much on-the-job Contracts and Toxics-torts law lessons). 

Unrelated rant: Just got the score today after a long and scary MRI procedure. :'(  Fuck, I can't even make cookies to feel better because of my terrible sublet oven. Couldn't work on my mandolin because I got home after dark (trying to keep the wood dust outdoors). No friends around tonight, and an early morning Dept. of Energy meeting tomorrow when all I feel like doing tonight is staying up until 4AM sobbing while listening to overly emotional movie scores."

ickip,2,2011-06-29,"With 3 months left before my work permit expires, what can I do to get sponsored and stay in the US?!",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ickip/with_3_months_left_before_my_work_permit_expires/,"Hi people of Reddit! This question seems generic but, trust me, its not (I think). Since I anticipate this will be a bit long, here is a courtesy TLDR. If you have the time, please read through!

TLDR: I am a 22 y/o recent college grad foreigner living in California and trying to get a job so I don't get kicked out of the country! I'm under OPT which expires in 3 months. My time is running out... What do i do?!

After lurking for a long time and seeing the truly inspiring things that this community has done, I have decided to post for the first time because I am in desperate need of your help. Since graduating from uni last year, I have been doing anything and everything I can think of to get a job. However, I can't seem to do it. So, what should i do??? (I assure you this is a very serious and time-sensitive question to me. I will explain further because my situation is a bit more complex than normal.)

**My situation:**
I graduated from a Bay Area university in 2010 and majored in finance. I came here from Asia about 5 years ago and could legally stay in the US because of an F1 visa. Now, I am under an OPT permit which expires in September. I have been trying to gain sponsorship (H1-B visa) for a year but I can't seem to do it. 
Ever since I was a kid, it has been my dream to make a life for myself in the US but I am seeing this vision slowly slip away as my time runs out. I feel almost helpless because I don't think many companies would commit to sponsoring me without being familiar with me (internships, referral, etc.). Additionally, I don't have the resources that Americans would typically have like family, money, connections, and friends. To top it off, my major is now in very low demand because of the current economic climate. What makes it even more frustrating is that I am confident that I am a highly desirable candidate for a job (I emphasized in investment management) and yet I may still lose my best chance for a life in the US. I feel forced into a corner where there isn't much else I can do. 

**Other details to consider:**

*I am 22. Currently living in North CA and renting an apt with a friend.

*I have been in a 3 year relationship with a wonderful girl who I love deeply. It would be devastating to me to lose her because the US won't take me. I will not consider marriage though because it is such an important life decision that I don't want to be forced into. Rather, it must be something I want for our sake, not for my job's sake.

*My parents recently migrated to LA (investor visa) but are suffering financially and cannot assist me either monetarily or job-wise. They are the only family I have in the US and can only give me emotional support (which I need very much!) 

*On that note, I have been surviving off of my savings over 5 years (roughly $13-14k in June of 2010, now $5k). I had only $1000 in 2006 and accumulated the rest through hard work at a Cafe, investing my money in the stock market, a well-paying 4-month internship, and creating portfolios for friends (and charging a 1-time fee!). I have been unemployed for 8 of the last 12 months. Even though I seem moderately comfortable, this cash is almost my entire net-worth. In the event that I can't stay here, my lifeline will have to be squeezed thinner wherever I end up next. Therefore, the uncertainty of the future truly scares me. Remember I can't hide under my parents' umbrella bec. they are now here and I may be separated from them in a few months time.

*I am half Asian, half European (hence the name) and possess 3 nationalities with the last being Australian. I am tri-lingual with some basic knowledge of French and German. I know that I have living options in the EU, Asia, and Australia, but you must understand that my goal always has been and still is to live in the US. I love the attitude of the people, the entrepreneurial and encouraging spirit, the vibrant culture, the sheer diversity of all things, and of course, my SO.

**Why I consider myself a superior (or at least above-average) candidate:**

*Internships with 2 fortune-500 companies, trained by a top Swiss bank, internship with an Asian bank in Asia

*Tri-lingual

*Founded my own Non-profit organization in 2007 (not in US)

*GPA of 3.8

*I've worked or volunteered in 4 different countries and think I have moderately diverse international experience.

*I developed my own portfolio optimization model which I use for myself and friends. It is a mathematics and statistics based model with some initial subjective input (like short-term macroeconomic forecasts)

Perhaps it is stupid for me to post this kind of plea here. I don't know. But I don't have much left to pull out of my hat so I think this can't do anything but help my situation. After all, Reddit has continually impressed me with its content and its people. 
I apologize if this post has breached any reddiquette, if it's poorly written, or if its too long. If there is any irrelevant data, I just wanted to be concise so we can get straight to the point. Conversely, please ask if additional info is needed and I will do my best to fulfill. 

So there we go. Please give me your advice, suggestions, or ANYTHING that will let me hold on to my dream a bit longer. I want to get busy. Give me something to do!!

Work life: I feel this may be the root of the problem. My job is not taxing, my boss does not hate me or treat my with disdain, my hours need not be long...but I am unhappy. As a result, sometimes my hours are long. I put off work all the time, preferring to spend time on reddit or other websites. I have gone whole weeks with only doing an hour or so of actual work. As a result, I am constantly stressed that someone will discover this and it will blow up in my face.

I believe the reason I avoid work is because I find my work insulting in that an unpaid intern could do it.

I’m still not sure if the demotion was due to my performance because they eliminated my position, splitting what were my responsibilities between two other people. This happened at the same time that several others were completely laid off from the company).

Home life: I feel I go from wasting time at reddit all day to wasting time on reddit, facebook, and whatever videogame has tickled my fancy at home. TV barely interests me, and my girlfriend and I rarely enjoy the same shows together, mostly because she can’t devote attention to anything interesting because she is working at the same time as watching TV...hence, cops/reality TV. I do love and respect her, but we have not been intimate for about 8 months. Part of the problem is me, but she has also been having problems at work and when she gets depressed, she loses all desire. I’ve stopped trying after getting shot down so many times. But at this point, I don’t mind, honestly. The thought of trying to have sex tires me out.

I do have other hobbies and friends that keep me busy, but even there I get the feeling that I bore people now.

I’m worried I may have adult ADHD or depression or something. I know that I need to switch jobs, but I have become so insecure thanks to the demotion and my current low-responsibility job. I’m almost scared that if I got a job that demanded something from me, I wouldn’t be able to rise to the challenge.

My question: what is the first step? Building my resume? Going to therapy? What?

It's kind of bugging me a lot, but given my situation, there's plenty of reasoning for both sides.

So I'm living in this guy's house, let's name him Joe. I moved in mid May and am staying until August. I contacted him late, but he said he would put me in the last room available in his house. So I'm sleeping on a futon for the entire summer... And the room is basically an office; Joe has his computer there.

So because of the computer, Joe comes into my room to do stuff. How often? I have no clue. It's probably at least twice a week. And this is irritating me, because as someone paying him money to stay in his house, I feel like I should have my own privacy in my room. My stuff is all over the floor because he didn't clean out my closet, so half my floor space is taken up. Granted, his computer is there, but he made the decision to put me in that same room, without any warning to me. 

Would you consider it invading someone's privacy if someone goes into your room without notice? 

**EDIT**: I never signed a contract, as it never seemed necessary. This was kind of setup through our company where he is a full-time and I'm a summer intern. He lives in the house all year long and has interns move in during the summer. So there are 2 with nice big rooms with a closet, and me in a smaller room. My closet is full so I have to leave my room and go to a separate closet. Something that seems important to mention: Joe did tack off $100 from a $500 rent, so I probably won't ask for him to lower it again."

I grew up on the edge of an incredibly small town, in PA.Country girl all my life. My real mother left for another guy, when I was 3, and had my sister. I grew up Daddy's girl/right hand man, I went with him everywhere, i worked side by side with him in the garage, went hunting, fishing, I was an all out little tomboy. Dads parents helped out a lot along with my dads Pap. Gram was and always will be the person I see as a mother figure. And I adored my great grandfather. Though I didn't know him long and have few memories they are some of the sweetest. 

All of this sounds alright so far.

It was also around the age of three I was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White-Syndrome (WPWS). Over the years I had doctors visits, heart monitors, medicine. But It was manageable. The worst part was the sticky things for the monitor. It always tore at my skin and had to try and take them off after getting them wet in the bath. My gram used to put them on these 3 identical dolls that i had to help me. I would pretend to take care of them like she took care of me. (the only ones i've never been scared of) To this day I have Pediophobia which is a fear of dolls.

Dad remarried when I was 5. The always dreaded stepmother. This woman despised me. Intern I came to despise her. She was a spoiled woman who had always had everything handed to her and never had to do a thing for herself. What my dad saw and still sees in her I will never know. I still went with my dad everywhere, I didn't want to be around the nasty woman. But everyone now and then I couldn't go with dad. He had changed jobs in the last few years because the place he had been working at went out of business. So he had work and meetings and places he had to be from time to time. Before I would of always been with Gram but now ""she"" was here. She treated me like scum. Wouldn't let me out of my room. I would sneak out for snacks praying she wouldn't catch me. If she did I got drug back to my room by my hair. She also was in charge of bathing me. I couldn't stand it. She made fun of me. Pushed me around, also mostly by my hair. I also had and still do have natural curly hair which knots easily. She would purposely yang a comb through my hair and yell at me when it broke. I would be so angry but could do nothing. All I could ever do was cry. To this day half the time I become Angry i feel helpless and start to cry. Its like a defense mechanism I haven't been able to shake. 

I tried to tell my dad about this, but whey ""she"" was around him she acted all innocent and all my dad could think was that I was being a bratty kid and he listened to the ""adult"". 

It was't for a few years and a few times that he caught her that he finally learned I had been telling the truth. Though he still seemed to think that I always provoked her. I shouldn't been speaking to her that way or I should of done exactly what I was told. There was always some reason. But I could see that it was tearing my father apart trying to choose between his daughter and his wife. 

Then when I was 8 years old my brother was born. Yes he is technically my half-brother but I will never see him that way. I love him almost like a son. As stated before ""she"" didn't know how to do anything. So at 8yrs old, i'm the one thats up all night feeding him, changing him, burping him and holding him. While dad was there he loved doing it all and did most of the time because he thought he was ""relieving"" ""her"" for a few moments since ""she"" works so hard any other time.

This is my first post, but I'm curious if I can get any answers.  I graduated with my BA last year, and I was wondering, in this economy, what would be your best suggestion to gain experience in HR?  I keep getting the same responses from potential employers, “you just don’t have the experience”  I have done everything I possibly can before I graduated (starting and ran my own organization on my campus called AIESEC, and did an internship abroad).  I thought all of the things would make me more attractive to potential employers.  Any further suggestions?

Most of the foreign students here (Americans, Europeans, etc.) are leaving in a week for their summer vacation and the Chinese students here don't do anything else except study for their finals.  The other American student who came with me is four years older than me and every time she invites me to go out to a bar or club, I have to make an excuse to say no (she called me out on it today, too).  It makes me feel really embarrassed that I'm 20 years old and I just don't like going to bars in general...or nightlife in general. Is it wrong that I don't like this stuff that normal 20 year olds like? I don't think I'm missing out on much because, in all honesty,...I just don't *like* drinking and smoking and being in an atmosphere where it's crowded and smelly.  I like meeting new people, but I'm just so damn shy.  It's been a month already and I'm still super shy and bored at the same time.  I guess I like day time activities more but there's no one here that I can go with.  I've done a lot of touring of the city but there's only so much touring (gardens, parks, etc.) I can do.  I'm also not very good with traveling by myself because I get lost easily...

Back home during the school year, I'm really busy with activities and I don't participate in the bar scene either.  But I have other things to do so it's okay and I don't feel embarrassed about it.  

What I'm asking is, what can I do to avoid the nightlife? Or should I just get over it and go? Is it something I have to get used to as I get older? How can I stop feeling embarrassed about this?"

I consider myself to be an excellent problem solver, and I would like the chance to apply myself in a professional situation.

ibza5,3,2011-06-29,MFA - I need some help.  Nearly lost my mind today while shopping for clothes.,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ibza5/mfa_i_need_some_help_nearly_lost_my_mind_today/,"Preface:  I'm a recent college grad and haven't really done anything for my wardrobe in years beyond tshirts, jeans and sneakers.  I just got a job (start Tuesday) where the dress code is business casual - which probably sounds extremely simple for most of you - but for me, it's becoming a nightmare really quickly.  Don't get me wrong, I've had internships and co-ops where business casual was the code, but being a broke college student, I could get by with the same pair of khakis and a few button ups and polo's.  Now, I have some money and am starting my professional career, and want to get it off on the right foot.  I've been lurking MFA for a few months now, picking up what I can and thought I picked up a lot...  Until I actually went shopping today.  I thought it was going to be a cinch, but turned out to be a very difficult endeavor.


Anyway, I'm looking for a more professional look while still keeping the business casual thing going on.  I want to appear like a young professional who looks respectable and should be taken seriously - not a college student, recent college grad, or a guy who buys his clothes at (insert trendy store here).  Monday - Thursday I'm thinking about wearing some black or dark grey slacks and nice button down shirts that could also double as shirts for a suit if necessary.  Summertime I'll just roll up the sleeves, fall and winter I'll get some nice sweaters to wear over.  As the checks start coming in, I'll add more to the wardrobe as I see fit.  With a budget of around $500 - $600 for those, I think I've got that covered.


What I bought so far just to give you an idea of what I'm going for (pictures look horrible compared to how they look in real life):

Standard Ralph Lauren casual khaki pants (can't find picture, they're not the ironed type)


I plan on going shopping Thursday at J. Crew, Banana Republic, and Nordstrom's for the bulk of my shirts and pants.


My breakdown happened when I tried to find some shoes.  I went to DSW (probably a big nono here, but I had to start somewhere).  I was honestly so lost that I had no idea what to look for.  I want a pair of black and a pair of brown shoes, but had absolutely no idea what would fit with the look I'm going for.  For the brown shoes, I'm looking for a lighter one, as it's still summer.  As I'll be wearing slacks with the occasional khakis/chino's, are the following shoes I was considering overkill/underkill/dreadful?

Ideas?  Thoughts?  Recommendations?  Criticism?  I'll take it all.

TL;DR - I'm an engineer with little fashion sense and need help with picking the right shoes for a business casual setting, where I am going for more the professional look than casual.  I'll also take advice on shirts, pants, and belts if you want to toss it out there."

ibwsm,1,2011-06-28,How do I get a freaking job?!,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ibwsm/how_do_i_get_a_freaking_job/,"Hi people of Reddit! This question seems generic but, trust me, its not (I think). Since I anticipate this will be a bit long, here is a courtesy TLDR. If you have the time, please read through!

TLDR: I am a 22 y/o recent college grad foreigner living in California and trying to get a job so I don't get kicked out of the country! I'm under OPT which expires in 3 months. My time is running out... What do i do?!

After lurking for a long time and seeing the truly inspiring things that this community has done, I have decided to post for the first time because I am in desperate need of your help. Since graduating from uni last year, I have been doing anything and everything I can think of to get a job. However, I can't seem to do it. So, what should i do??? (I assure you this is a very serious and time-sensitive question to me. I will explain further because my situation is a bit more complex than normal.)

**My situation:**
I graduated from a Bay Area university in 2010 and majored in finance. I came here from Asia about 5 years ago and could legally stay in the US because of an F1 visa. Now, I am under an OPT permit which expires in September. I have been trying to gain sponsorship (H1-B visa) for a year but I can't seem to do it. 
Ever since I was a kid, it has been my dream to make a life for myself in the US but I am seeing this vision slowly slip away as my time runs out. I feel almost helpless because I don't think many companies would commit to sponsoring me without being familiar with me (internships, referral, etc.). Additionally, I don't have the resources that Americans would typically have like family, money, connections, and friends. To top it off, my major is now in very low demand because of the current economic climate. What makes it even more frustrating is that I am confident that I am a highly desirable candidate for a job (I emphasized in investment management) and yet I may still lose my best chance for a life in the US. I feel forced into a corner where there isn't much else I can do. 

**Other details to consider:**

*I am 22. Currently living in North CA and renting an apt with a friend.

*I have been in a 3 year relationship with a wonderful girl who I love deeply. It would be devastating to me to lose her because the US won't take me. I will not consider marriage though because it is such an important life decision that I don't want to be forced into. Rather, it must be something I want for our sake, not for my job's sake.

*My parents recently migrated to LA (investor visa) but are suffering financially and cannot assist me either monetarily or job-wise. They are the only family I have in the US and can only give me emotional support (which I need very much!) 

*On that note, I have been surviving off of my savings over 5 years (roughly $13-14k in June of 2010, now $5k). I had only $1000 in 2006 and accumulated the rest through hard work at a Cafe, investing my money in the stock market, a well-paying 4-month internship, and creating portfolios for friends (and charging a 1-time fee!). I have been unemployed for 8 of the last 12 months. Even though I seem moderately comfortable, this cash is almost my entire net-worth. In the event that I can't stay here, my lifeline will have to be squeezed thinner wherever I end up next. Therefore, the uncertainty of the future truly scares me. Remember I can't hide under my parents' umbrella bec. they are now here and I may be separated from them in a few months time.

*I am half Asian, half European (hence the name) and possess 3 nationalities with the last being Australian. I am tri-lingual with some basic knowledge of French and German. I know that I have living options in the EU, Asia, and Australia, but you must understand that my goal always has been and still is to live in the US. I love the attitude of the people, the entrepreneurial and encouraging spirit, the vibrant culture, the sheer diversity of all things, and of course, my SO.

**Why I consider myself a superior (or at least above-average) candidate:**

*Internships with 2 fortune-500 companies, trained by a top Swiss bank, internship with an Asian bank in Asia

*Tri-lingual

*Founded my own Non-profit organization in 2007 (not in US)

*GPA of 3.8

*I've worked or volunteered in 4 different countries and think I have moderately diverse international experience.

*I developed my own portfolio optimization model which I use for myself and friends. It is a mathematics and statistics based model with some initial subjective input (like short-term macroeconomic forecasts)

Perhaps it is stupid for me to post this kind of plea here. I don't know. But I don't have much left to pull out of my hat so I think this can't do anything but help my situation. After all, Reddit has continually impressed me with its content and its people. 
I apologize if this post has breached any reddiquette, if it's poorly written, or if its too long. If there is any irrelevant data, I just wanted to be concise so we can get straight to the point. Conversely, please ask if additional info is needed and I will do my best to fulfill. 

So there we go. Please give me your advice, suggestions, or ANYTHING that will let me hold on to my dream a bit longer. I want to get busy. Give me something to do!!

I do have to admit that I have a CS degree, err actually a CIS degree (less math but less theory too).

That said, I ""struggled"" with programing in college ( at the time I was nearing 30 and had no experience programming as a teen ), but managed to get mostly a B average with some effort ( my GPA was a 3.0 in the end, non-programming classes were good to me).

I've been doing Web Development with PHP for about a year now. I did an internship for 3 years, but it was part time, and mostly learning.  I still struggle mightily!  Stupid ""duh"" moments are a dime a dozen and happen every single freaking day.  I feel it takes me twice as long as it should to code something up, and while my boss praises my ""genius"" I know it is just because he doesn't know programming.  

I feel so drained at the end of the day that I can barely program another couple hours (I ENJOY programming and have a lot of personal projects as well as trying to learn other languages). I end up coming home an drinking - thank college for that habit, which certainly doesn't contribute to me getting anything done.

How can I make my brain better?  Should self teach myself some of the maths (Calc-I was the highest I went), or read up on the theory?  Or is just plugging away and pulling my hair out going to teach me more?  It doesn't feel like I've gotten any better over the last year (maybe slightly).  

I'm actually starting to get a bit depressed with this... problem - and I'm an upbeat guy.

Maybe somebody has a solution, similar experiences,  or can tell me how stupid I really am.  Everybody I know in person thinks I'm pretty smart (at least slightly above average - I'm no genius, but after this last year (and last few months at work, to be honest), I feel absolutely stupid.  

Should I find another career?  I LOVE programming, though not necessarily my current job.

Keeping and reducing the HST to 11% or 10% appears to be sound public policy. As an economics major, I can appreciate the comparative simplicity of the HST and the need for the province to increase their tax revenue to meet an aging and increasing population.

However, I feel very strongly that the BC Liberals need to be held accountable for their backroom dealing and the disgusting manner in which they forced through the HST. I don't want them to feel like this was AT ALL acceptable and expect that they can do this in unpopular legislation in the future.

I'm sure someone will say, ""Don't let your feelings about the Liberals distract from good public policy, there are other ways to hold them accountable."" I really doubt this. What would I do, write them an angry letter for some intern to toss in the recycling bin? Hold a rally that no one will pay attention to because the HST debate is ""over""? It seems like the only message the Liberals might actually listen to would be a majority vote to abolish the HST... but I think the HST is actually good policy in itself.

Any thoughts? Do you know how you'll be voting on the HST ballot?"
idmem,3,2011-06-30,Suiting Up...,gengerald,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/idmem/suiting_up/,"I will be interning in Washing DC in about a months and I have finally gotten the attire requirements for my program, a suit or a sportcoat and slacks everyday. Like many I have a limited budget and will be starting with the basics, as my existing blazer is aweful. Future plans after this 3 month internship will be further interning at law firms and law school. I don't expect a great suit, I merely need a few to get me through the next couple years with minimal wear.

My initial choice was to get two or three Indochino suits (navy, charcoal, black) and then slacks to mix with the navy and charcoal blazers. Yesterday I headed to a JoS. A. Bank store and found that I can get 3 suits (navy, charcoal 3 piece, and black) with a gold/etc. microcheck blazer for ~$1000. 

After much reading there seems to be a trend of these being decent entry suits for the sale price you can get them at. Cut wise the 38R's fit, however I am a bit slimmer and had hoped to go with tailored fits. The salesperson suggested bringing in the sides a bit instead of the tailored fit to let the jacket be more comfortable when moving around, etc.

I will post a picture of the three suits (not too useful) and links to them, but they are 2 signature suits, 1 signature microcheck blazer, and a three piece 'Joseph' suit in charcoal.

Does anyone have any of these suits or an opinion on the tailored fit. Personally, the difference between regular and tailor isn't as physically noticeable as I would have thought.

TL;DR - Need basic suits for internship, don't have much info on JoS. A. Bank, and wondering about tailored fit vs. just bringing in torso section."

One of the clients I work for has an intern that I like. She's not a 10 by any means, more like a 7.25. I speak to her very briefly when I help her with her IT issues and most of that pertains to work and what we're trying to accomplish. I've probably spent a good 7 - 10 minutes total getting to know her as our schedules are wildly different. My last days of working at this client are fast approaching and I feel if I don't act soon, I may never run in to her again. 

The question:
How do I get the balls to talk to her? How do I bridge the cap from being ""the IT guy at work"" to ""the guy that stuffs her?"" What are some tips or techniques that I can employ? I'm a fairly(VERY) negative person with a shitty outlook on the world. I'm not a good looking guy. I'm probably average in every respect. If this post doesn't belong here, let me know and i'll go elsewhere. Thanks."

Here are some details:

* We currently have a set of MS Excel spreadsheets with data covering about 2,000 clients (Name, address, phone, demographic &amp; application info) and about 7,000 invoices (Number, date, amount, budget category, etc.). All of this existing data needs to be pre-loaded into the database.

* We have a list of the additional data that our interns &amp; field auditors will be adding to each client record (a few yes/no fields and a status update field to know when the client's file is closed out) and each invoice record (itemized products, work tasks, and prices, along with a field for field auditors to indicate whether &amp; why each invoice item passed or failed for quality and/or quantity).

* We need someone to set up the database and the forms for updating the records, set up the website and logins for about 15-20 people, provide some short training via conference call or virtual meeting when everything is set up. We will need an automated way to create reports on the data by category, by contractor, and other fields. We will probably need very minor support for the site (back up, technical problems, etc.) while the project is going on.

* The project will be finished within a year (probably less), then we'll need the entire database and all associated files to be archived and delived to us for long-term storage.

We have a scope of work set up for the project and we are finalizing the full list of new data fields that we want our interns to add to each record and each invoice. 

We have a modest but healthy project budget and we want to get going with this project as soon as possible. Please PM me with your proposal for an appropriate solution and your qualifications (&amp; examples of past work), or for any additional details that I may have forgot to provide here. "

I currently work there as middle management for sales. I got an internship because of him a few years back, (I got the internship because of nepotism, I'll admit it, but I got the job because I'm qualified) I have been employed for a year now, and was just promoted 3 months back. I was told by him that the board is pursuing prospects to buy out the company (not sure if he is permitted to tell me this). Also the CEO and CFO stipulated in the potential buyout, that only certain individuals (TBD by them) would keep their jobs, others would be granted severance packages, and even some would have to be laid off. 
So in the past few weeks our officers have taken 12-15 off-site meeting with potential buyers. Everyone at work has no idea why these meetings are occurring, but they know something is up. They are aware of my relation to the one of the board members and keep on asking me what is going on, even one of my bosses. I obviously have not told anyone anything, only that 'It's not like they tell me anything either'. 
In reality, we are almost certainly being bought out and I don't know what will be happening to most of the workers. Many of our employees are beginning to become worried, they think we are going out of business or being downsized. I am not sure how to get their minds off of it. Especially since their productivity in the upcoming months will be a determining factor for keeping their jobs. They are all fairly certain that I know something, probably because I am not a good liar.  I am in my late 20s and have only been in management for a little while, and this is my first real dilemma. It’s even worse since I know information that many of my bosses don't even know. I am confident that my position will be kept, since I am now management and the relay man for nearly all of our larger accounts. However, I need them to stop asking me about it, but make it so that they still get the message that they should be working more diligently so they don't stick out for the wrong reasons.
So Reddit...any suggestions?
TL;DR: I know my company is going to be bought out, everyone at work suspects something, but not they're not sure what, but I need them to stop worrying so that they work hard to ensure they keep their jobs. It sucks, I know."

Well, year comes and goes, they have me stick around but I never got asked to go full-time and things sort of fall apart at the company.  I decided that it was time to move on.  After months of never hearing back from a job, I apply to another two and suddenly get interviews for both of them.


Both jobs seem great and they seem to want me, but they both require me to move away.  Here is the predicament.  At the same time, my two part-time jobs NOW want me full-time.

I got a position as an intern then was offered a full time position following my graduation and turned it down. That offer was during the initial hiring freeze Inbev put in place so it was a very rare circumstance. 

I worked in 2008 and was there before InBev rumors started, during the rumors, and then immediately following the purchase as well. I decided not to work in their environment and got a job elsewhere. I specifically was a Systems Engineer working in the Engineering group at one of the breweries. We supported the packaging, brewing, and administrative parts of the brewery which included the PLCs that ran a good portion of the process.

As part of my introduction they had us work in different sections for 2 days at a time (I think that was the length) and cycled us around so I saw brewing, packaging, etc from all the angles.

I also worked with the plastic bottle line, which at the time we were the only brewery with it. So anyone that has drank from a plastic Budweiser bottle got it from the the bottle line at my brewery.

The 'Ultimate Factories' documentary does a pretty good job as well showing how some of the stuff works if you are interested.

To answer the first question I am expecting - ""Did you get free beer?"" The answer is I got so much free beer that I literally was giving away boxes (4 x 6packs) every other week. Some of the fun things - 

Get a physical done? Show the Environmental, Health &amp; Safety (EHS) guys and get a free beer ticket (ticket = 1 case)

Donate blood? Get a free beer ticket

Someone submits a 'Bud-Gram' (a 'thank you' card) for you? Get a free beer ticket

I am feeling so down and unmotivated lately when it comes to looking for work. I am within less than 2 months of graduating from a great university (just have to finish my thesis), and looking for an entry level position with an advertising agency as an account planner or an account executive. I spent 8 months networking and hobnobbing with an ad agency that told me numerous times I was a ""sure hire."" They told me yesterday that things have changed and that they thought I was great, but there was no longer a job.

I get it, things change. Clients leave, and they don't need to hire more account people. But...seriously? I have so little agency experience that most agencies don't take a second look at me after reading my resume. The intense networking I've done in my small city has paid off...in friends, and not much else. I have done an internship at the biggest and most successful agency here, but now I can't even get the connections I made there to respond to me when we plan catch-up or networking lunches. Even more frustrating: these same people are proclaiming lunches and meetings with a lot of former co-workers and interns, whose acquaintances we both share. I've applied to tons of agencies outside of my area as well, spending the time to craft personal messages to the HR departments, and attaching my portfolio. Never get a response. A girl I interned with over the last summer just got a job out of the blue, because her dad knows the agency owner. She doesn't have any relevant account service experience or a relevant degree. I talked to a recruiter in Chicago the other day, who said she doesn't get paid to represent people with less than 2 years experience, but she would give me a go because she loved my portfolio. Now, no response to my emails, no info...nothing.

I'm frustrated, beaten down, and depressed. I'm in a fantastic relationship with a successful IT professional, who is willing to support me should I choose to get an unpaid advertising internship or move if I should get a job elsewhere. But, I can't. I can't get anything anywhere, not even an answer to my emails. I also feel guilty that my own incompetence and un-marketability will lead to him having to work harder to support the both of us. We live together and while my mother sends me money to help out, she is in the middle of a nasty divorce and makes very little money at her secretary job. Currently, I work at my university, and am squirreling away as much money as I can to prepare for the inevitability of my joblessness in two months, when I am not allowed to work there anymore because I've graduated. I'm scared and feel like a failure, especially since I started applying and networking almost a whole year ago. 

I'm smart and confident and my work speaks for itself. So what is wrong? I feel unfulfilled and unhappy in and with myself, and am thinking that I should get a job, any job, to pay the bills...but I have a horrible feeling that I will never get out of it because if the agencies don't want me now, why would they want me with my limited agency experience + a food service job? I need experience, but I don't know that we can afford to live, or move to a bigger city with more jobs, on only one income.

Sorry about the length of this. It sits so heavily on my shoulders and my heart, and I'm tired of it being dismissed by my well meaning mom and boyfriend, who insist that it will ""be ok."" It doesn't feel like it at all. 

Please help me feel better. Tell me about your job experiences after college.

**TL;DR**: I am so depressed and frustrated and sad and worried about my impending joblessness. "

Our country is in a dangerous position. Today, Rep. Paul described the state of our nation in a way that both awakened and terrified me: Although our country contributes only 5% of the total population of our planet, we house 25% of its prisoners. This is not because Americans are especially violent, or lurid, or immoral, but because of the racist policies implemented in our country decades ago that we deceptively refer to as the War on Drugs. I say deceptively because, to date, the ""War on Drugs"" has only served to increase, not abate, national drug use. 

Henry J. Anslinger, engineer of the policies which shaped the War on Drugs, testified before Congress, saying, ""There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others."" If you believe that you are intelligent and informed enough to ignore my argument, you must also be intelligent enough to realize that the claims which founded marijuana prohibition are patently racist and, ergo, morally illegitimate. 

Furthermore, I have read that many of your fellow Republican Congressmen have argued that marijuana has a known substitute, called Marinol, which is a concentrated form of THC. Marijuana, on the other hand, is comprised of a complicated mix of multiple forms of THC and chemicals called cannabinoids, which interact with different receptors based on their structure. Many people have reported that Marinol makes them feel worse than the symptoms it claims to ease, and it is easy to see why after watching this video: http://youtu.be/8J7cZf2tFCQ You can see that any solution composed of pure THC is an improper replacement for the delicate mix of THC and cannabinoids found in marijuana. 

Furthermore, you should also be aware of the numerous social benefits of ending marijuana prohibition. Our police are stretched thin, made to enforce laws which have proven to be neither productive nor just, save for lining the pockets of the municipal court racket and the private prison industry. Legalizing and taxing marijuana would bring desperately needed funds to your constituency, free police forces to pursue real safety hazards and real violent crime, including drug-related violent crime. Let me repeat: legalizing marijuana does not mean legalizing drug-related violent crime. 

Finally, I also wish to address the argument that marijuana is a gateway drug. Marijuana is only considered a gateway drug because it is sold by drug dealers, who, in addition to selling marijuana, also tend to carry other wares: psilocybin mushrooms, powder cocaine, Xanax, ecstasy, et al. Legalizing marijuana would remove from these drug dealers a customer base and regulating marijuana would ensure that the chemicals which have historically been sprayed on marijuana by drug dealers, such as glass and green paint, would not make their way into the market again. If anything is a good example of this fact, of the benefits of regulation, it is the flesh-eating cocaine (sprayed with levamisole) that is currently wandering our country. 

Consider these facts, weigh them carefully in your mind, and decide what is right for the voters (and the Constitution) that you serve. Occasionally I find myself asking, ""Are politicians human beings? Do they worry, the way I do? Do they sense their mortality, the way I do? Do they have trouble falling asleep, the way I do? Are they depressed, hopeful, ambitious, perceptive, fearful - the way I am?""

Well, Congressman, are you? Prove me wrong.

I'm currently a 2nd year going into my 3rd year at a four-year University. I want to start recruiting in my 3rd year so I'm hoping to pick the best internship that would provide me the most relevant or best resume building experience.


I'm currently choosing between a corporate finance analyst internship job where I'll be organizing data collection methodology, assisting creating of valuation models, and statistically testing collected data sample

vs.


Finance intern at a investment / wealth management firm where I'll be assisting them with client investment plans, entering trades into computer, managing stocks, and calling insurance brokers to make sure that the firm isn't doing anything illegal and everything is fine. I'm not sure how involved i'll be in the whole process but the interviewer mentioned that since its a small firm, I'll be exposed and involved in the whole process.

Both internships are at pretty small companies, nothing fortune 500 or anything like that, so i believe i'll be able to do actual work rather than coffee delivery or secretary work. 

Right now I'm debating which one would look better to consultants during recruiting season and which one would teach me more applicable skills in the business world.

thank you all in advanceee &lt;3 "

The problem I have is I don't know which area of study I want. So many aspects interest me.


Do any of you fall under this field, and if so:

* How did you get there?

* What sparked your interest in it?

* Where did you go to school/what classes did you take?

* Did you go to the police department or another office and look for internship type opportunities?

* What should I know about venturing into this field?


I'm in a city college right now, just trying to figure things out. So any advice you can offer will be greatly appreciated!"

I've been recently laid off from work and am currently job searching. While it is a hurdle, I have found ways to occupy my time while searching for a job over the past 2-3 months (community college courses, an internship, networking through ""young professionals"" clubs, babysitting for a nearby family, etc.). Unfortunately my savings are wearing thin (maybe 2 months of expenses left?), and I've become a bit scared/depressed/etc. (This isn't the issue, just setting my emotional level over the past few weeks.)

Anyway, through this occupational upset, I've come to realize that my partner isn't someone I can emotionally depend on. Possibly. My partner doesn't ask me about my day, how I'm feeling, who I met, what I've accomplished. (Even when I had a job there were never questions about my day, how projects were going, goals met, etc.) I do talk about my day, but after a few minutes of no questions or observations, I clam up. I feel like they aren't listening. I've tried to be better, to power through and continue relating my day as if they are interested, but no dice. They will start browsing on their phone or even interrupt with an anecdote from work and then completely takeover the conversation or leave it at that. They aren't interested in what I have to say. This non-interest in me carries over to other aspects of our relationship, such as: not caring if I get off during sex, doors slamming in my face because they forget I'm walking behind them, making dinner only for themselves even when we have plans to eat together, and more. They say they love me, but I feel like their actions show they like the security I offer them, not me as a person and the things I experience.

How do I communicate that I need more from a partner? Even when I explicitly state that I want someone that cares what is going on in my life, that I need someone invested in me not just physically, but emotionally? What else can I say or do to send this message home? Currently I think the issue is that they are used to being an individual and not in a couple, but it's already been over a year. Is it time to cut my losses and be on my way?"

icwdt,3,2011-06-29,Need some advice...,wilsun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/icwdt/need_some_advice/,"I recently graduated with a BS in CS from a good top/second tier university (some digging in my profile/history will no doubt reveal it). I interned last summer as a software engineer and am now participating in an information systems rotational program in a defense company (again, some research will easily reveal its identity).

Problem: I effing hated the internship, and am already dreading going into work a week after starting at my first full-time job. This may have something to do with the fact that I was not given much to do in my internship and my current manager has been too busy to assign me tasks and I have no admin rights on my workstation so I can't do anything fun with it. Or maybe I just realized I hate industry.

Now, I have choices. I can certainly stay on this job, but I'm scared that spending years in an IS rotational program will put me behind the competition in terms of software engineering experience, and software or systems engineering is where I ultimately want to end up. If I leave after just a week, I'm scared that I'll be burning bridges and maybe end up hurting me in the future.

I don't know. Academia, maybe?
