15sfyq,10,2013-01-01,"16 and considering dropping out of highschool for the sake of learning, am I being stupid?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15sfyq/16_and_considering_dropping_out_of_highschool_for/,"So, let me elaborate a little.

I discovered programming when I was 14 and learned C/C++ during a couple of my classes with the help of a few books. Ever since, I have never been so sure of what I want to do for a living. Learning how to program almost inspired me to begin to learn about the full story, about how computers operate. I always knew that I wanted to do something tech related (I guess that's what spending tons of time on the computer does to you), but now I was sure.

Unfortunately, I still feel as though I cannot do anything close to what I hoped for.

Let me say that I pretty much have a hatred for school, not because of what it aims to do, but how it does it. I could go on a rant, but i'll just try to get to the point. I cannot learn anywhere close to the amount of stuff I want to learn about computers mostly due to highschool, and i'm afraid the same will apply to college. So now I have these thoughts floating around in my head, ""why should I bother with highschool when I can teach just myself?"" I really wish it were that simple. 

With that said, I have a couple of questions:
Is it realistic to expect being able to land a job in the CS field as a highschool dropout, assuming that the person has the required knowledge for the job?
If so, what are the kinds of things you would need on your resume to have an employer consider you in the first place?
Would it be possible to find an internship as a hs dropout?
Am I being stupid?

Any additional advice/words of insight would be greatly appreciated. Really. After all, I am only 16. I don't know anything. All I know is what I am interested in.

Thanks."

I am currently a freshman, and I am currently looking at Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science as prospective majors. Since it's the long winter break at the moment, I decided to look up possible summer internships. The google search results overwhelmed me, and I was not able to find any websites that looked credible enough to me. I know there are people here who have been through this internship mania before, so I took it to this subreddit to seek an answer. 

Alright, I'll stop giving background info. **So, what is the best way to look for an internship?** Are there any particular websites that you guys would recommend? Is there a university-based search engine that I could use to look up these opportunities? (with 'search engine', I meant something like the powerful Summon for credible library content)

All of your help is appreciated! Thank you. :)


EDIT: I am looking at CS as a major at this moment, but by the end of the second semester I will not have completed any specific CS classes (except for the introductory one, 131/132). So basically, I won't have any specific experience in the field of Computer Science. On the other end, I will have completed two Mech E. courses - (EMAE 160 &amp; EMAE 250). I'm guessing this will affect my chances of getting an internship with a CS-based company."

I've been studying Japanese since the summer of 2011. I've been taking courses at university, and they're quite intensive compared to some. We blow through many grammar concepts in only a week. We also learn anywhere between 30 and 50 vocab words and 13 kanji per week. In my time off, I want to get ahead in these courses so I can skip some classes in the curriculum, which will make it easier to join study abroad opportunities or an overseas internship through my university. I anticipate this will occur over the summer.

This week is my last week of winter break. This means I have just a little bit of time left before class begins, which is my true test of my Japanese abilities. I've been overextending myself at school, and I feel my Japanese studies have taken a hit because of it. As a result, I'm taking fewer classes this quarter so I can focus more on Japanese. I received the course materials in advance, so I can take a look at those.

**今週の目的：**

* Convert last quarter's materials (vocabulary, kanji) into Anki decks for review
* Review next quarter's materials (hopefully all, at minimum two lessons) and translate practice sentences
* Find speaking partners"

I would really appreciate some help and input. ,throwaway123qw,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/15s82z/very_unusualbizarre_legal_situation_regarding/,"Last Friday I went on a cruise. The cruise came back to America through Miami yesterday (Monday) and in order to depart the ship you had to have your ""Sea Card"" swiped. (essentially a room key that is tied to your passport). When my ""Sea Card"" got swiped a small alarm went off. A Customs agent fetched me and brought me to a back room were they questioned me and searched me very thoroughly. 

The primary question they were asking was: Have you ever been in legal trouble before? I have never even gotten a speeding ticket let alone ""legal trouble"". I was able to look at the customs agent's computer and it noted at the bottom in a bright yellow text box  ""Previous Offender - Subject to 100% thorough search"". And then below that it said ""Arrested In June 2012 For Trafficking Hashish Through The Port Of Miami"". I haven't been to Miami prior to this weekend in years and I have never gotten in any legal trouble period. The Customs Agent told me since the system had me as a previous offender I am supposed to be pulled aside every time I go through customs. Since I disputed ever getting into legal trouble he gave me a pamphlet for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and told me to write them and receive the record they have on file for me. The DHS pamphlet also states that their system is shared with the State and Federal record system. I am in the process of getting my records back now.

My clean record is something I take great pride and an such an act of incompetence is astonishing. I already know this is going to be a pain in the ass to get taken care of just like everything is with different Government bureaus but I am pretty confident it will get worked out eventually. 

If this false charge is infact on my federal record then could this possibly explain the reason why I have not been able to find a job, internship, or scholarship in the past year? Would I be eligible for a settlement from the DHS for this colossal mishap?

Has anyone heard of anything like this happening before? I would appreciate any input.

New Year's Eve I'm sat alone in my room in my hostel because my friends are either not in London or not in the country. As far as I knew I was due to start work at 8am the next day anyway (ironically I didn't actually have to start til 12). Big deal, NYE is overrated, I think. Optimistic about the new year, I head off to work this morning feeling fresh. I leave work with a note saying ""I hereby give you one week's notice to terminate your temporary contract"". I was a Christmas temp in retail, but 3/4 employees were due to be kept on. I was the unlucky one. I've been offered an interview for a well-paid fashion/media-related job, but still haven't been given a date and won't get one until Thursday at LEAST. If I don't get this interview on time (I'm relying fully on the lady I've been in contact with to not brush me off) I'll have to move home with my batshit crazy mother in a small town. I'm gay, and living in London is perfectly comfortable for me. Moving in with my parents doesn't just mean moving in with my parents, it means no sex and certainly no love.  
This has been the worst year of my life. I was a dancer, but I hurt my back and had to stop in January. I then did an unpaid internship where I felt like a piece of shit amongst school-girl type social hierarchy. With some anixety issues, the fashion world is far from ideal. In a huge amount of debt, I got another internship, this time paid. It was OK, but i spent too much time worrying about the impression I gave to the people who I had nothing in common with. Although I did well, my boss rightly so told me I didn't suit the job because I was too creative (and she wasn't 100% sure if the company could afford to keep me - except they decided to keep an old intern instead, some American girl who popped out of nowhere with her perfect life and perfect fiance), and told me she could get me some work in TV/Film production. Perfect!! I was so excited, and I knew it would be perfect for me. Well, I got a phone call from an assistant diretor who asked me if I'd be interested in something big in a month's time. Not ideal, but I just said yes and looked forward to his call. There wasn't one, even though I text him twice. I got in touch with my now ex-boss who was reassuring me that she hadn't forgotten about me, but what did it matter - I needed a job!! My friends' graduation came around and I was still jobless. Eventually the only person to hire me was a horrible dirty old man who called me ""sexy"" and paid me minimum wage while getting me to turn around so he could look at my bum, and cmplimenting my t-shirt saying I looked ""hot"". My respect for him was at 0 a month later; he eventually sacked me because I ""wasn't listening to him"". Understandable - He sexually harassed me so I avoided leaving my seat and avoided dressing nicely. I politely thanked him and left. Another jobless month or two, and I end up as a Christmas temp at my current job which is due to end next week. I met a really cool guy who worked in music production and needed something as a transition into another job. He's funny, cute smile, we're both a little bit geeky and love music. Perfect guy. Oh? What's that, universe? I can't be happy? OH. HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND. My first ever straight crush couldn't come at a worse time. Oh and my friend recently moved 2 hours away to live with her parents and my other much closer friend is moving back with his parents too. I found out when I saw a status asking if anyone wanted his room. -__- I'm going to kill my fucking self. No friends, no job. If this woman withdraws her interview offer I'm going to kill my fucking self. I reeeally want and NEEEED this job, but I can't shake the feeling that she's going to withdraw her offer after I pester her out of desperation. I just need some validation. Vent done."

There should be (or is there?) a sub directly related to solving female friendship problems. I don't know. But anyway.

So I've been friends with this girl for about three years, and in the time that I've known her, she's become steadily more awful to be around. She has one of the most self-defeating personalities I've ever encountered, and constantly sabotages herself and her future, then complains about it to me. She's 22 and has never had sex, a boyfriend, or even been kissed, which she also complains about constantly to me. (She's not bad-looking, either - at most, she's chubby, which she *also* complains about all the time, but when I've offered to make her my running buddy, she got upset and said - direct quote - ""Who says I *need* to improve myself? Besides, I never even ran in gym class, I'd fail at it if I tried now."" See what I mean by self-defeating?) She's floundering in her career and blames it on the fact that she went to a no-name school instead of one of the top institutions for her field, but instead of just putting herself out there and trying to get internships, part-time/freelance gigs, etc., she works a retail job she hates and complains about how the privileged kids at the ""good"" schools are taking all of ""her"" opportunities. She wants to do comedy professionally, but she won't sign up for improv or sketch writing classes. She only really cares about a TV show and its stars, which is seriously depressing and boring to talk about. If we're hanging out and I try to bring up something that's been weighing on my mind - guy troubles, for instance - she twists it around into how at least I *have* a guy to have trouble with, but she's forever alone, and now she's going to talk for ten minutes about that. Even when I go out of my way to include her in group activities with other people she doesn't know very well, she gets clingy and then sullen, and keeps me from being able to enjoy hanging out with my *other* friends.

Also, she freely admits she has depression and anxiety attacks, but she won't go to a therapist because she had a bad experience with therapy one time, and she won't try to get medication because... she just won't. I don't know why.

Needless to say, this has put quite a strain on our relationship. It seems like a lot of the time, I'm hanging out with her because I feel *obligated* to - because I know she'll throw a fit if she sees on social media or whatever that a couple of her mutual friends and I went to the movies together without inviting her, or because she texts me moaning about how no one has invited her out for New Year's Eve. (Guess how I spent last night?) I really liked her as a person when I first met her, and we do share a few interests, so she's a good activity partner and person to see movies with, etc. But sometimes, hanging out with her just makes me depressed and upset, and I don't know how to handle that. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around her to avoid upsetting/offending her, and it's not worth it to me, because she doesn't offer much in return - she rarely invites *me* to hang out or does much to show that she appreciates me, but acts as though she's entitled to my friendship.

I know that the adult answer here is to just be direct and tell her, tactfully but truthfully, about what I'm feeling. But the thing is, I've tried that before, and she absolutely cannot take criticism of any kind. A few months ago I tried politely suggesting that she read some recipe blogs and learn how to cook (she was complaining about wasting money on $10 sandwiches at work every day) and it ended with her telling me that I was making her feel like a failure and threatening suicide. So yeah, clearly that's off the table.

I honestly just need some sort of advice here. Has anyone ever been in a friendship like this? Is there any way I can gracefully get out of it without it being obvious that I'm abandoning *her*? Now that I've written it all out, I see how clearly toxic this whole situation is - but I'm one of only a few friends she has and I definitely feel obligated to stick it out just for her sake. I don't know. I'd really appreciate any advice you ladies have for me.

**TL;DR: I need help gracefully extricating myself from a friendship wherein I can't talk truthfully or directly with the other person.**"

15rpeq,2,2013-01-01,Question about majoring in something film related.,[deleted],Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/15rpeq/question_about_majoring_in_something_film_related/,"As the Spring semester of my sophomore years nears, I'm getting more and more worried about finally declaring a major. I asked my counselor about doing something film related as that is one of my greatest interest. The closest thing that my school (Georgia Southern University) offers is a Multimedia Communications major (with a digital film making emphasis). I could also minor in Film Studies, which I assume is more of a history of film than a how-to, but they don't offer that as a major.

Of course, I know that if I choose to major in film making I will not be directing major Hollywood blockbusters anytime soon as I'm sure there are thousands of kids that major in something related and there are only a handful of famous film makers out there. Fortunately, I do live close to Atlanta, an upcoming city in film, so I am hopeful about landing some sort of internship.

 My question is, what type of backup jobs are there for people with such majors? What else could I do with an education in Multimedia Communications while trying to make it big in the meantime? Would it be possible for me to work for a TV station or perhaps as some sort of online journalist (like for Noisey or Pitchfork or any of those companies that do interviews of musicians and report at different music festivals or anything else like that)? With the knowledge I receive would it be possible for me to make something like a TV pilot with friends and pursue that (I know that's a pipe dream, but occasionally shows like Workaholics and It's Always Sunny hit it big lol)? Could I work in music videos? 

Sorry for vagueness. I don't know a whole lot about the field yet (but that's the point of taking classes in it right?), but I am very passionate about movies and have fantacized about working in them for a very long time... especially when I worked at a movie theater and constantly thought about how I could think of better ideas for movies than half the ones that sold out lol but even before that when I used to make little movies with my friends as a kid... now I'm finally considering pursuing that dream in a somewhat practical manner. 

**TL;DR: Thinking about majoring in film, but I'm sceptical. What are some perspective back-up jobs for film majors?**"

I have an interview for my dream internship in February.
I've been on one date my whole life, and that was a year ago.  I mustered up the balls to ask a cutie in my Econ class out at the end of the semester, and she said yes.  We'll see each other when we get back.
My GPA is shit but I always hated school until recently.  There's still time.

I feel like if I don't step up now, it'll be a huge setback.  

I will learn as much as I can about the Android platform.  I will get that job.  It might work out with the girl and it might not, but if not it won't be because I was a nervous fuck with a self-conscious tone of voice.  This won't happen with future girls, either. 

I will maintain a more active social life.  I will come on Reddit less (sorry guys).  I will only facebook someone when I plan on talking to them.  I will not let my past limit my present interactions.  I will build something cool.  
I may weird people out, but it will stop being because I'm feeling awkward or insecure.  I may have to work on this.  

I will feel comfortable whether or not I lose my virginity.  I will stop having those moments where I feel like a shittier person because no one wants to bang me.  How about the fact that I haven't been in a relationship?  That shows more about my ability to communicate.

I will actively monitor my list of shit to do.  I will eat healthy as FUCK.  I will become a better musician.

I will get some A's, and maybe sleep sometimes.

I will stop comparing myself to others.  I'm not them, and I'll never be closer to them than a shittier knockoff.

I can't do all of this if I keep fapping for an hour a day.  Here's to 2013.  Good luck, everyone else :)"
15riu7,3,2013-01-01,[21/f] How to tell friend [18/m] to grow up without being mean?,pikapikapikaCHUU,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/15riu7/21f_how_to_tell_friend_18m_to_grow_up_without/,"During my summer job at a summer camp, I became friends with a volunteer [18/m]. My boyfriend [21/m] was away for the summer months on an internship halfway around the world. This volunteer (we shall name him Jason) and I became really close friends really fast, and we found ourselves sending texts to each other very often. He would come early or stay late when his shift was different than mine just so he could hang out with me. 

He is a very shy and introverted person who feels very uncomfortable in a crowd. Of our group of staff, I was the only one he was comfortable approaching and talking to. Jason started telling me about his past relationships (or lack thereof) and about his insecurities. As he had just graduated from high school, he was very nervous about going to college and starting a new life. Since I was entering my fourth year of university, you could say that I was much more experienced than him, and therefore, I frequently tried to give him advice. He has since then thought of me as a close friend who listens to him and from whom he can seek advice. He complains to me all the time about not having made many friends in high school and regretting it. He feels that he only has female friends and has no “bros” and he constantly frets over it. I tell him that he’s starting a new life in college, so just learn from his mistakes and not to worry too much, that he’ll find many more like-minded individuals in college to make friends with. 

As close as we were however, even during the summer, he was constantly worried about my SO coming back. He has never been in any past relationships before and he feels that he can't be friends with girls who are in relationships. For some reason, he feels like girls who are in relationships can't be good friends while being in a relationship. I tried my best to convince him that it is possible to do both: to be a good friend and a gf at the same time. I once asked him, ""You know I have a bf, and we're still friends now. Why can't we be friends once my bf is back?"" His reply to me was that it didn't feel like my bf was there, and he was worried that my bf would take up all of my time.

At the end of the summer, he admitted to me that he liked me, and said, “I love you as a sister, but I would date you if you didn’t have a bf.” He has since then said “I love you” to me once in a while, but I never responded to it, since he knew that I didn’t like him that way.

A couple weeks ago, it was my birthday, and I planned to go out with some close friends for dinner, and I asked if he’d be interested in joining us. He was cautious at first, but said sure, even though I told him that he doesn’t have to if he felt uncomfortable. He assured me that he would go and promised that he would make an effort to get to know my friends and talk to him. However, the night of the dinner, he remained unsociable throughout the night even though I placed him next to someone he has met before a couple of times. He answered any questions that my friends asked with a simple yes or no, and snuck off to the washroom half a dozen of times. At the end of the night, he didn’t even bother saying bye and just walked off towards the bus. 

I have not talked to him since then, since I can’t stop myself from feeling disappointed and upset that he didn’t even bother to make an effort to be sociable. I wasn’t asking him to be best friends with them or anything, I just expected more of him. He has tried to contact me every day since then (facebook messages, msn, texts, phone calls…), but I have yet to answer. It’s been over a week and last night, I received a message from him saying that he was giving up, yet he called me twice that night. I have no idea what I should do… he is so socially awkward and I feel like I’ve just been too reassuring and babying him. He needs someone to tell him to grow up and suck it up, but I don’t want to be mean. What should I do?

TL;DR: Made a friend 3 years younger to me who says he loves me despite knowing I have a bf. He is socially awkward and whiney and I am tired of babying him. How to break it to him that he needs to grow up without hurting him too much?

15rgls,0,2013-01-01,Need help weighing options ,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/15rgls/need_help_weighing_options/,"I'm a 21 year old student who is a heavy semester and a summer internship away from graduating with a BA and on a scholarship. I am intellectually stunted - I've been severely addicted to video games (particularly World of Warcraft in high school), pornography (still addicted), and as a result of my intense attachment to things that provide immense dopamine surges I have become severely depressed and lost a large portion of my ability to focus and learn. I've seen/been seeing a psychologist for these issues and have not really made any achievements. In fact it has made me a bit more pessimistic about resolving anything in my life. I have immense difficulty making decisions and friends because I feel so inadequate and lack direction.

Now from a ""rational"" standpoint, I know it makes sense to finish off the year and just withstand my depression and live in my fucked up head for another year until I get my degree and move or travel somewhere. I'm scared though, I don't know if I can handle experiencing the stress I put myself through for another semester. My biggest fear is wasting time.

I've recently been looking into WWOOF'ing (volunteering on a farm in exchange for food/board), because not only do I have an opportunity to get away from things that inhibit my focus and ""growth"", but I'll be forced to work hard and learn through experience rather than books/lectures (which are such an unnatural and ineffective way to learn). The primary downside is I have a tendency to dwell on guilt, and if in the future I look back and see me foregoing my ""education"" at this point in order to stay sane then I'll have a near impossible ability to forgive myself. Also, I'll have missed out on $8k which I would have been given through the school.

I know only I can end up making the decision, and I think a large part of my fear of continuing school is pressure from family, but similarly I know it is most important to do what I think is best for me. Can anybody who has been in a similar situation provide me with any advice? Thank you, happy new year.


**TL;DR**: The next 6 months of school don't entail me learning anything, just receiving money to get a degree and then an internship that may help me find a job. I am also very sick of school and have inhibiting addictions that I can't overcome in my current environment. Do I go work on a farm while I recoup, or do I tough out school and build my addictions and insanity and wait to overcome those obstacles later?"

December 30, 2012


I just woke up and thought I should write this down before I forget. I haven’t been sleeping that much lately, which is why I am just now waking up. The paranoia and fear is just getting worse as the case goes on. I had this really weird dream. I was in a field. Just a field like you would normally think of when you think about fields. Trees everywhere with shrubs at their bases. There were some deer off in the distance and I could hear birds chirping. The sun was shining. As I stood there thinking about how this would be a good place to come and think. I started thinking about my childhood. I used to come to a field just like this and play with my dogs. They loved to play fetch in the grass. When it was really tall they loved to sneak up on me or leap over the grass like gazelles. 


I thought it was a dream about that. But as soon as the sun vanished and the clouds covered the air, I knew this was no dream – but a nightmare – and not one that was about my dog filled childhood. 


When the clouds covered the sky, the plants all died. The trees lost their leaves, the grass turned brown, the flowers wilted where they stood. The deer dropped dead and the birds fell from the sky. There was a smell in the air that I can’t even begin to describe; it was so disgusting. Beyond disgusting. Like rotten flesh and rotten eggs and rotten milk all combined together. I watched as all the deer dropped to the ground and I ran to them thinking there could be a way for me to help. But when I got there, there was nothing I could do. Their flesh was already rotting and parasites had already come to eat the meat off their bones. 


Suddenly, I heard a loud, low groaning sound. It was coming from all around me. It sounded like it was coming from the trees. I couldn’t escape it by running. It just got louder and louder the longer I was in that field. I saw some concrete stairs going into the ground. I watched myself run. It kept switching from first person view to third person. It was really disorienting. I kept going towards the stairs and then hurried down them. At the bottom of the stairs there was a beat up wooden door. Something told me I shouldn’t open the door, no matter how badly I wanted to escape that groaning sound. That I should force myself to wake up and just keep going on with my life, without opening that door. But of course, like in all nightmares and typical Hollywood teen screams, your gut is ignored.

 
I opened the door. It creaked and it felt like it was going to fall off its hinges. There were scratches all over the back side of the door. Like someone had been trying to escape. It was cold as I entered the hallway the door lead to. Ice cold. I shivered. I didn’t know if I was shivering from fear or from the cold. Either one was entirely plausible. I closed the door behind me and the groaning stopped instantly.


 It was pitch black dark, but I walked down the hall anyways. I tried to move quickly, but my feet felt like they were made of lead. It felt like each step took five minutes. It was driving me crazy. I put my hands on the walls to guide me. I felt inscriptions on the wall, but I couldn’t tell what they said. I patted my pockets to see if my cell phone was there. It was, so I pulled it out of my pocket and when I went to open it to shine light on the wall, it shocked me and I dropped it. I winced and shook my hand to get the pain to stop. I went to pick it up off the ground, but it turned to dust as my hand touched it. The dust was unusually warm and more ashy than grainy. I stumbled forward, keeping my hands on the walls to guide me. I felt more inscriptions, but I wouldn’t find out till later what they were. I felt a corner and slid my hands onto the cold wall in front of me. As I felt it, trying to find an escape, I felt a handle. I put my hand on it, tried to push or pull the door open. It wouldn’t budge. So I tried sliding it open. And that worked. It slid open with a loud bang. 


I walked into the room and slid the door closed behind me. The lighting was like a doctor’s office. The kind of light that washes out your skin and makes it look blue. I always hated that light. The room looked like the morgue in the hospitals. In the middle of the room there was a metal table, shiny and eerily clean. Like it had never been used. Along the walls there were drawers you put dead bodies in. The room smelled strongly of sulfur.  Next to the table there was a little cart with various surgery tools on it. I walked towards it carefully. Every step I took was deafening. I got to the table and picked up the first tool I saw, a Stryker saw. My dad was a coroner so he would always talk about that stuff over dinner, which I really didn’t appreciate. The only time I put up with it was when I was doing an internship for him when I was trying to decide what part of the police world I wanted to join. 


I started thinking about how I had to watch him use various saws to cut ribs open to get to the heart. I remembered the blood everywhere and dropped the saw on the ground, forgetting I was holding it. It hit the leg of the cart and all the tools fell onto the ground. The metal clanked against the tiles on the ground. The sound was just as deafening as my footsteps had been. When the sound stopped, I started to look around the rest of the room. It was back in third person. I watched myself wander around the room. My other self looked into the file drawers that weren’t full of bodies. He pulled out some papers and looked at them. All the files were in a different language, but neither me nor the other me could tell which language it was. I watched myself find a single paper in English, talking about the Lake Bodom murders. I remember Googling the case a couple years ago out of curiosity because one of my favorite bands was named after them. No one ever found out who committed them. Maybe Stitch was behind those attacks too... Then suddenly I was back in first person. As soon as I oriented myself, I started hearing banging and moaning. I looked around the room and saw the body drawers shaking. I heard people pleading to be let out, moaning and groaning, begging. I started panicking and ran to the corner. I sat on the ground and covered my ears and closed my eyes, hoping against all hope that the sound would stop. And it did. It wasn’t a good quiet though. It was a scary quiet. Eerie. The quiet went on for what felt like forever until the loud groaning sound from the field started again. I walked to the sliding door trying to find a way to escape it again. I opened the door but couldn’t see anything. My eyes were still adjusting to the darkness in the hall. Once they did, I saw Stitch standing at the end of the hallway. You could only see one of his arms. He took a step forward and then I could see him holding his chains behind his back. 


“Are you trying to hide?” Stitch said. 


“Where am I?” I asked. 


“We are inside your memories,” he replied. 


“Why?”


“I want to ruin your best memories. I feed off fear and anger. I killed the animals and turned the sky gray. Now look behind you and feel more fear,” Stitch said. All of a sudden there was the stench of rotten flesh and blood in the air. I turned around slowly. As I turned around I slipped and hit my head on one of the counters. I put my hand on my head to ease the pain and closed my eyes. When I opened them, I looked at my hands and they were covered in blood. I looked around the rest of the room and the floor was flooded with blood. Papers covered the floor. I looked at the body drawers and saw all of them were open. The dead bodies inside them were sitting up on their metal beds, smiling, with dead eyes and pale skin. One had a gunshot wound on his head with crusted blood around the edges. Another had his throat slit. Another was severely burned; his skin was blackened. Their smiles were still and frozen. Like mannequins. I turned back to look at Stitch again. His arm was still bent back. 


“Meet my latest victim. Courtesy of you.” He grabbed his chains with both of his hands. He jerked someone roughly. As the mystery person went flying through the air, Stitch jerks him back by the neck even more roughly than before. It yelped and cried in pain. He landed right in front of Stitch. There was a chain around his neck. It could’ve come off, but there were spikes driven into his neck, keeping them in place. The holes in his neck kept oozing blood. His legs were broken off at the knee. His femur was sticking out. The skin and muscle were all torn, still bleeding. From his bottom lip to half way down his neck, the skin was gone. The muscle was disturbingly red, bloody… it made me want to puke. It seemed like every pore in his body was blood oozing out of it. He was so beat up. Some of his teeth were missing. His hair was torn out in chunks. His arms and chest had gruesome scratches all over them. His eye lids were missing. His eyes were dried and shriveled. There were chunks of his face missing, along with the rest of his body. 


“You know who I am,” Stitch’s victim said. 


“No I don’t,” I said quietly, scared. 


“Yes you do. You watched me get taken away.”


“RepetitiveRoutine,” he said. Then it hit me. I recognized his short dark brown hair with its slight curl. I felt a fit of tears coming and held them back. Suddenly, RepetitiveRoutine came loose and started bounding towards me. He ran on his fists, like an ape. While he ran, he screamed blood curdling screams. Terrified, I stumbled back and ran as fast as I could to the corner of the morgue-like room. I slammed the door and as soon as the sound rang through my ears I woke up. Or at least I thought I did. 


“You need to wake up, Ryan. It’s time to have breakfast,” a voice said. I found myself in my childhood bedroom, cuddled up in my Scooby Doo sheets. I rolled over and saw my mom watching me. Before I could answer her, Stitch came up behind her. He loomed over her. He was wearing a blue button up shirt with slacks. He put his hand on her shoulder. She put hers over his. 
“Hey, honey. I’m just trying to wake up Ryan,” she said. 


“Wake up, son,” Stitch said. Stitch was playing the part of my dad. But my mom couldn’t even tell that my dad wasn’t there. She couldn’t tell what was coming for her. Naked again, Stitch tore her skin off in one piece and danced with it, laughing. I was left frozen in terror. And even with her skin missing, my mom stood there smiling. After a little bit of dancing, he tore her skin in half. The back of her landed on the floor and he held up the front in front of him. He put his eyes where hers should be, wore her like a mask. 


“Good morning, baby,” he said, mocking my mother’s voice. He stuck his tongue through her lips and wiggled it around at me like a child, and started laughing again, even louder. All the while, my mother was standing there, all meat, just looking at me. Stitch dropped the rest of her skin on the ground and grabbed her veins from her ankles and wrists. He wrapped them together and swung her around, her feet touching her hands. As he swung her around, her blood splattered all over the room. It flew onto my face and I nearly threw up. I tried to get up off my bed and run away, but before I could reach the door, Stitch pushed me against the window. A piece of broken glass cut my back, leaving a huge scratch. I woke up for real then, drenched in sweat. 


I went to the bathroom before I started writing this. There’s a scratch on my back… I’m going to go to the hospital now and get this checked out. 
I just thought of this… My dad’s still alive. Why was Stitch pretending to be him in my dream if he’s still here? Maybe I should go stay with him for a while… 


I know you guys have been wondering about Anna too. I still haven't heard from her. It's been a while now, a week and a half... I'm starting to get worried. She won't answer her phone, her emails. There isn't even anyone there when I go knock on her door. This is getting distressing. What should I do?

",[deleted],singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/15usi7/summer_internship_in_singapore_would_yall_be_able/,"I'm an undergrad student in the U.S. and I got an internship for this upcoming summer in Singapore. I'm really excited about it, but I have a few concerns/questions regarding a budget. 

1) What should I expect to spend a week on food? I know this varies from person to person, but I can be somewhat frugal if I have to and buy my own groceries and eat in. Obviously I would like to eat out (cheaply) sometimes to experience the foor of Singapore, but someone told me to expect to spend around $150 u.s. a week on food and that sounds entirely too high to me.

2) How much a week should I expect to spend on transportation costs?  I would be working downtown, but I'm not entirely sure where I'm living yet. I know I'm living in a ""student residence"" or some type of student dormitory near downtown, but I'm not sure exactly where that is....I know that's probably not a sufficient amount of information to give me an estimate but a rough transportation cost for nearby areas would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks a lot!"

Basically, I have an inside track in obtaining another internship there again.

While that is wonderful, I'm still looking for other opportunities because my internship at Company X didn't quite align with what I wanted to do for the future (however, it is still a wonderful Company to work for, and would look good on my resume).  That being said, I'm applying for another internship at Company Y, and it asked me to list references.  I'll be able to provided references from Company X (unfortunately, they would be my only good ones, and I wouldn't really have any other references to choose from), but I'm worried because if I get rejected from Company Y, would that hurt my chances with Company X?  I get the sense that it would be awkward if I ask the references to help me get another internship at Company Y, even if I plan on applying at Company X again.

Hopefully this is clear, and thanks for any help!

15ujf6,5,2013-01-02,2013 - galaxyrocker - Irish and a debate with myself,galaxyrocker,Team_Other,https://www.reddit.com/r/Team_Other/comments/15ujf6/2013_galaxyrocker_irish_and_a_debate_with_myself/,"Hi y'all. I'm galaxyrocker, from small town USA. I've been learning Irish for about a year now, with a month of immersion in the Gaeltacht. Sadly, that was followed by a semester in Dublin, where I actually **lost** a lot of my Irish. So right now I'm standing somewhere between A2/B1 level. I hope to get my Irish back up to speed this year, and progress to the C1 level, and hopefully experience another immersion program over the summer, and maybe intern in an Irish language setting. I most likely won't be able to post next week, and the week after looks unlikely too, due to travelling, but I'll be studying.

My plan for Irish, at first, is to just review my textbooks from school, and go over all the notes I took during the summer. I'll do this until I return to school and classes get started back up. Once there, I'm going to do all I can to speak with a native speaker every day and work on my speaking, as that's easily the worst part of my abilities. I also plan on reading *Harry Potter agus an Órchloch* as well as taking a translations course to boost my reading skills.

I want to learn another language this year as well, as my Irish is getting to the point I just need more and more immersion. Quechua was my first choice, but due to a scheduling conflict, I could take Beginning Quechua this semester then wait until next Spring for Intermediate, or I can wait and take them back to back starting the Fall semester of 2013; that looks like the most likely option, though I *really* want to take it now, to see if I enjoy the language. (Read between the lines: somebody talk me into it, dammit!)

If I don't take Quechua this semester, I'm going to try either Scots Gaelic or another Native American language. I have a lot of resources for Scots Gaelic already, and the similarities to Irish will make it super easy (Certain dialects are still mutually intelligible). If I go the NA route, I'll be looking at Navajo, Ojibwe, Cherokee, or Quechua on my own (perhaps meeting with the teacher to practice this semester). The problem with that is resources. 

If I do one of those, my goal there is to be conversationally fluent by the end of the year, more if I can achieve it. I know this'll be hard with the Native American languages, as there's very few places to get free practice for them, but I'm going to try.

TL;DR

Languages: Irish and Scots Gaelic/Native American (maybe)
Goals: C1/C2 and Conversational Fluency


Since I most likely won't be able to post this coming Sunday or the Sunday after, due to travelling, I'm just going to say that I'll be reviewing everything I've done for Irish, and possibly looking into the pronunciation/grammar of whatever other language I chose.

Good luck to everyone!"

15ugm7,13,2013-01-02,"My most degrading fantasy part 2 [Mdom, bd, huml]",GarterGirl,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/15ugm7/my_most_degrading_fantasy_part_2_mdom_bd_huml/,"Minutes past as I stared up at the raised platform where the man in the cowboy hat was pounding against the girl's ass, gripping her sides and grunting over her.

What about this girl, I thought. Did she need my help? If so, was I in any position to help? I took a few steps closer to get a better look at her.

She turned to face me, her head rocking with her body as she straddled a large, padded beam. Her feet and hands were held down by thick leather straps, and another one ran over her back, leaving her immobilized. She said nothing, and her expression was blank. If anything, she seemed mildly annoyed by my presence.

I mouthed the words, ""Are you okay?"" to her.

""The bitches don't speak,"" the man said as he continued thrusting in her.

""Is she -- is she drugged?"" I asked.

""I don't put drugs in my livestock.""

""I'm sorry? Your livestock?""

""You heard me.""

The man slapped the girl's ass and tugged again at her hair. She closed her eyes as her head tilted back and gave a satisfied grin. With her head raised, I could see her breasts hanging down, and I was suddenly struck by how beautiful she was. I've always been partial to girls. Had a few flings in college, and even a girlfriend for a brief time. So it wasn't a total surprise that I would respond to her, but in this context I found myself...well, confused, to say the least.

""You call her livestock? But she's a person. A human being.""

""Not here,"" the man said, slowing his rhythm down to address me. ""In here she's just a dumb animal. Her purpose is to take cock and get filled up with cum. That's what all my livestock are for.""

""All?"" I turned my head, suddenly noticing all the girls looking out over the gates of their stalls. There were at least a dozen of them.

""Oh my God,"" I said. ""What have you done to these girls?""

""I told you, they're not girls. They're livestock. And I haven't done anything to them that they didn't want done.""

I looked at their faces, vacant and pliant, seeing nothing to contradict what he was saying.

""That's not possible,"" I said. ""You've kidnapped them. You're some kind of sick fucking sadistic monster!""

The man chuckled. ""I'm not going to tell you I'm normal. But I'm no sadist. I treat my livestock as well as they deserve to be treated, and they all very much appreciate my affections. I don't know what it is, exactly. I just have a way with them. Now shut your damn mouth for a minute. This bitch is gonna cum for me.""

The man tugged at her hair with both hands, raising her head as far as the strap on her back would let it go. He leaned back, ramming himself deeper into her cunt and yielding moans from her that clearly indicated the height of an orgasm. I was silenced by her beauty, and for the first time I registered in my mind something that felt like...envy.

""That's a good pony,"" the man said. ""Keep on it. Squeeze that cunt around me. Here it comes."" He grunted, then froze, and spasmed. The girl's ass smacked rapidly against him as he unloaded himself in her. When he was finished, he released her hair and let her flop back down on the mount, seemingly unconscious.

He pulled his cock out, still somewhat hard and dripping with his fluid and hers, then walked over to a bench right next to the mount. To my surprise, another girl emerged from behind the bench, naked and on her hands and knees. Apparently she'd been there the whole time. She rose up as the man approached her and took his cock in her hand, then began licking it clean.

He turned to me as the girl took him all the way inside her mouth. ""Still think they're here against their will?""

I was speechless. Not knowing what to say, I blurted the first question that came to mind.

""Where did all these girls come from?""

""Oh, I've got a connection that delivers them to me. It's a law firm back in the city. I give them a lot of business, so they take in candidates I select, tell them they're 'interns' or some bullshit, then send them out to me on fool errands.""

My eyes bulged. I gasped audibly. And I swear to god my nipples sprung up right there on the spot. In amongst all the fear and anger and disgust, I don't think I'd ever been more turned on."

",PlayForMeeps,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/15ueu4/on_the_fast_track_to_rock_bottom_super_long_sorry/,"This is going to be long. I don't know that I even need advice, but I'm close to rock bottom and I think I just need to put things into words. Feel free to skip to after the break if you don't want every little detail. 

I've always been told I was ""smart""- I was in the gifted program in elementary, loved reading, had exceptionally high test scores, good grades, etc. Not that any of this means anything- I think intelligence is a lot more than that, but all the standard indicators of being intelligent came easily to me. Now I'm in my second year of college and really struggling. 

First semester I did okay- an A- in chemistry, a B in my (honors) religion class, and a C+ in calc I. I was really proud of my calc grade- I was basically failing that class for the first half but worked really hard and did well on the last test and the final (I have a really good calc prof- I owe a lot of that and my passion for math to her). I wasn't doing well in my introductory bio class so I pass/failed it (my university allows you to do that for a number of classes) so it didn't affect my GPA.

I took two classes over interim and got A's in both of them, which was good. However, I also lost my job (at the time I was working as a part time receptionist) due to layoffs/cutbacks. This was also when I went in and got diagnosed with ADHD- I started meds and felt a little more confident/capable, despite the financial stress of not having a job. Second semester I went off the deep end a lot. My relationship with my boyfriend was falling apart (we were ultimately together for 2 years) and I was drinking a lot to avoid dealing with my problems.  I came out with an A, two B's, a B+ and a C.  I withdrew from calc  II halfway through the semester because I wasn't doing well in it- my teacher wasn't involved and I was too caught up in my problems and functional alcoholism. 

Over the summer I worked full-time doing research and took two classes. This was the best and worst idea- the classes were online but pretty intense (each a month long). I didn't sleep much and I think it came at the cost of my performance at work, but I got an A and a B. This brought my GPA to a 3.16- which isn't bad at all. At the same time I started running and trained for a half marathon on my own. At the end of this summer was the best I've ever felt- I was in shape, had knocked out six credits, and successfully completed a research internship under a nazi advisor without going absolutely insane. 

---------------------------------------

This semester I decided to really going to buckle down. I pared down my schedule to the absolute minimum classes that I need to be considered full time and stay on track with my major. I started a new job as a pharmacy tech which I loved, and worked about 20 hours a week (between 4 jobs). I was finally making enough money to save a little and keep my head above water (I receive very little aid from my parents outside of tuition), really working at school, and barely partying. I got a C in Calc II, a C+ in organic chemistry II, and a D in physics. *What. The. Fuck.* This brought my GPA to a 2.78. I have to average a 3.58 GPA this semester (17cr.) in order to keep my financial aid. Needless to say, I'm stressed out- I'm in really deep shit if I lose financial aid. 

I want to pull it together, but I don't know how. I'm trying to keep a positive attitude- I understand there's nothing I can be doing *right now* to change. I picked up as many hours as I could over break so I could afford to work a little less during the semester (closer to 12 hours total). BUT here's the kicker- I went in to work today and was fired. Their reason was, essentially, that I wasn't learning fast enough. Apparently I'm ""great with customers"" and my boss ""really likes me as a person"" but I'm just too error-prone. I'm devastated- I loved the job and the people I worked with. I wasn't exactly the best tech of all time, but I didn't think I was *that bad*. I didn't see it coming at all. Now I've basically been sitting at home for two hours in shock, crying and attempting to figure out where my life went wrong. I'm still in denial I think- not angry, just *sad*. I'm looking for jobs right now, but I really just want my old job back. I really don't know what to do. I feel like I'm terrible at everything I love doing (my major, jobs, etc.). I've always thought I'd go to grad school but have really been interested in the MD-PhD route lately- obviously I can't do that with a 2.78 GPA (or probably even a 3.0 or 3.5 for that matter). I don't feel like there's any way for this many things to be going so poorly in my life if I'm not the problem- but I don't know what else I'm supposed to be doing. It's getting harder and harder to keep a positive attitude. I feel like I've disappointed my parents and teachers (who all had really high expectations for me because of how well I did in high school). It's also frustrating that most people in my major at my school are able to pull 3.5+ without breaking a sweat. What's my next move supposed to be? I guess I'm here because I don't feel like I can make the right decision for myself anymore. 

TLDR: 

* Apparently suck at school- the more I try the worse I do. At risk of losing financial aid and having to drop out or transfer. 
* Lost a job I loved, now worrying about how I'm going to pay bills and eat.

Subject: Women and Politics

Message: Women need to stay out of politics! Barefoot and pregnant is the way to go instead of getting in the way of a man’s job. Come on now! Politics have been a man’s place since the beginning of our country and traditional standards should still apply. 

Think of all the great things accomplished before women could vote. Our nation expanded west with very little help from the women. Most of the women stayed back in the East until the real work was done before they came out to Texas or California. As soon as they received the vote-Boom-nine years later we go into the great depression. Without any time to get back on our feet, we have World War Two. Women start working more outside the home and there is a loss to our family based nation. 

Look at what has happened in the past years of our nation when a woman has gotten her hands into politics. Eleanor Roosevelt, a good woman, but she took control when her husband was sick. She stepped out of her place and literally was running things in this country with out a vote. She should have been the wife Roosevelt needed and helped with the nursing tasks. Interns (Monica) wanting to get a head, find themselves giving special privileges to Clinton caused a scandal just a few years back. With this set back on Bill’s career, which was able to jump right into the lot for Presidency, but the wife, Hillary. Let’s not forget Marilyn Monroe and JFK. Think of the other women who got their fingers into the political realm somehow or another. 

Please don’t take this the wrong way, but the Sarah Palin campaign was a hoot. The people love a good story don’t they? Until the saintly mother has a demon child who turns up underage and pregnant. Poor Sarah is neglecting her duties as a wife and mother. She should have been taking care of those children. If she had known where her daughter was more often, the girl wouldn’t have gotten a chance to get pregnant. How could we even think that a woman, who is emotional and disgruntle at least one week or more a month, could ever run our country logically? 

Girl fights are not what they are cracked up to be. Women are too passionate about their own feelings to think it through to be in Congress or the Senate. Since so many of them are required to be judges at home between who broke the vase or not, they might do well in a courtroom, but feelings will get in the way when compassion has to take a back seat to war on terrorism or capitol punishment.

Prior to this, I was a business and mathematics double major. I'm only a semester behind on my Comp Eng. major because of the math classes and programming class that I have taken. I would like to apply for summer internships right now, but my resume is looking very bare considering that I have no engineering clubs/work experience to put on it. I have been a member of 3 organizations, but they're all business related and I'm afraid that this will confuse a potential employer. I also am not confident in my ability to answer technical interview questions seeing that I have not taken very many classes related to my major.

Do you think it's worth applying for internships now, or would it be better to wait a semester and get some classes out of the way and join an engineering organization? I would really like to get an internship this summer, but I'm not sure if it's possible. I'm afraid that if I don't find an internship this summer, I'll have a lot of trouble getting an internship as a junior and ultimately have trouble getting a job. I'll be all caught up after I take a class or two over the summer, so would it just be better to wait until then to apply?"

I feel like I've missed out on a big part of my life by going off to college with a girlfriend and not getting any time on my own, isolated from everyone I used to know, to just develop as myself in a new environment. My weekends are all automatically filled with spending time with her, and it's often stressful on me to have to find something that we'd both enjoy. Then again, this may be me blaming her and finding an excuse for introversion at college.

I also will hopefully be getting an internship next summer across the country. She says she's happy that I got an interview and wants me to get the internship, but then she just nags about how we're going to see each other over the summer, what is she supposed to do while I'm in California with my job, etc. 

In general I know she's much more involved in this relationship than I am. She talks about how she wants to marry me, plans for what to do after we get married, and so on, and talking about those topics makes me uncomfortable. Yet, I feel like I'm being unfair to her because I don't share those feelings right now, and I don't want to hurt her by telling her she can't discuss it with me. I feel like these feelings are my fault for not putting enough effort into the relationship.

So I thought about breaking up with her, and convinced myself to do it. Then we sat down and talked, and I told her what was happening with the job/relationship, and she didn't say much. She feels guilty, like she's done something wrong, and I don't want her to feel bad. This stuff bothers me, but I don't want it to hurt her, and I prefer that she get stuff out there in the open instead of bottling it up.

She treats me so well, and she is so honest with me that I feel bad having these thoughts about breaking up with her. I know I have it well, and I'm very lucky to have her, but I just don't feel the relationship anymore. But then we have talks like the one I just described, and I realize how lucky I am with her, and I start to feel for her again. At this point it feels like I should stay with her, but I also have a part of my mind that says otherwise, and I don't know what to do.

tl;dr: Spent a long time with this girlfriend, shared a lot, but feel trapped and like I'm missing out, but then when I bring stuff up with her, I feel a rekindling, and don't know if I should keep at this or let it go finally"

To keep things liquid, or save before grad school",knee_on_a,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15twkz/internship_money_retirement_savings_to_keep/,"Hi everyone! So, I'm a 20 year old Junior in college (engineering) in the US and I've been having summer internships since halfway through high school where I've earned around 5-7k for the summer. I've had to pay my parents 5k each year for college tuition out of that.

So in total, at the end of this next summer, I will have around 14k or so total (roughly, but I think this is a very good estimate as I'm pretty predictable with my spending patterns). For once, I won't have to give 5k of that to my parents for tuition (scholarships yay!), so I have something to work with.

This 14k will go to covering my Senior year school and living expenses (probably 4-5k for all of Senior year). Then I will have another summer's earnings (+8k or so) before grad school (I hope to do a 1yr MS). When I get to grad school, I want to have money for a (dependable but cheap) used car. And I'll have to start paying for gas and rent and all those fun adult things...

I guess the key issue is this: I feel like I have/will have a lot of money laying around. Is there enough extra to put some into a Roth IRA or something like that to start saving for retirement? Or should I keep everything liquid in anticipation of big expenses (first car, etc) in the next two years or so. Basically should I be doing something other than just keeping everything in a savings account?"

I'm over-involved in my college extracurriculars (currently in three, all with leadership roles), hold three jobs, have a semi-remote, minimally demanding internship, and am a full-time student.

I don't have time to hang out with my friends anymore, and that's a problem. I'm a social person, but I don't have a life outside of all of my work--and that's a problem. My grades are also starting to drop--problem. My sleep schedule is an utter mess--problem.

I know that I need to quit some things. Not everything, but at least some things. It's just that everything I do seems to interesting, productive, and in itself, a fantastic opportunity. I fear that if I quit something, I'll regret it deeply. I'll lose out on an opportunity to be a part of a successful company, or I'll sour a previously fantastic relationship (my departure means more work for others, for instance, or they'll feel like I'm abandoning them), or botch my chances of getting into grad school. 

But ... I want to go back to having a life. To enjoying the fantastic friendships with friends whom I so frequently have to turn down because I have so much work to do.

I'm everywhere on campus, but if I keep this up, I fear I'll my friendships. I want to return to a happy medium between work and play, but as of right now, my fear of regretting it (or screwing up in doing so) is much stronger.

Life, I think, is more about the relationships you build than it is the titles you hold and the competitions you win. But my choices are clearly not a reflection of my priorities.

Let me be clear: I'm not depressed, or anxious, or OCD, really anything like that. I'm told that I am a happy, friendly, and energetic person--and for the most part, that's how I feel. But I fear that if I continue to be overworked, my energy won't last much longer."

The lights come on and I hear a door open. The girls raise their heads to look out over their stalls as our captor steps in. He's a large man, dressed all in denim and wearing a cowboy hat. He keeps his head tipped down so we can't see his face.

He walks past stall after stall and I can sense each girl's heart racing as he moves on, leaving them be. He reaches my stall and I hear the hay floor crunch under his boot as he comes to a stop. He opens my gate and steps in, barely acknowledging me on my hands and knees before him. He clears his throat and spits. Without looking down, he unlocks my chain from the wall and gives it a yank, choking me and forcing me to crawl toward him.

The man in the cowboy hat leads me out into the center of the stable, past a stack of hay bales and into a clearing where all the other girls can see me. I crawl in time with his steps, keeping my head bowed as he leads me toward the leather mount he's built in the center of the stable. I know that today is my day. I am his livestock and I've finally been chosen for breeding.

***

How long have I been here? I can't even remember. Days, maybe weeks. I was an intern at a law firm. We needed signatures from one of our biggest clients and he couldn't be reached, so I drew the short straw and had to drive out to his ranch to get them in person. When I arrived, no one answered the doorbell, but the lights were on, there was a car in the driveway, and I'd driven an hour to get here, so I walked around back.

I found this stable, and I could hear music blasting inside, so I opened the door and peeked in. I found a dark, empty hallway. The music was much louder and it was coming from just around the corner. It sounded like 80's rock. Van Halen or something.

""Hello?! Is someone in there?...I'm from the law firm! I just have some documents that need to be signed!""

No response.

I thought about leaving, then I thought again about the miserable, hour long drive it took to get out here, so I stepped into the stable and let the door swing closed behind me.

The music became deafening as I walked down the hall. Reaching the end, I leaned into the corner and poked my head around to see where it was coming from. And that's when I first saw the man in the cowboy hat, his pants around his knees with his bare ass exposed. His belt buckle was jingling with each thrust as he pushed himself into some girl he had strapped on his leather mount. You'd think I would have run instantly, but I didn't. I was too shocked. Instead I just stared. I watched him pull at the girl's hair, then grab her hips and rock them in time with his thrusting. I heard him grunting, first quietly and then loudly as the girl's bottom smacked harder and harder against his belly. I had no idea if I was witnessing a rape or just a very kinky couple, but whatever was going on, it was clear the man was about to cum in her. Of course, part of me wanted desperately to leave, but I couldn't. For some reason, I had to stay until the man finished inside the girl. I had to watch her get filled...

And then, without warning, the pounding drums and cheesy, wailing guitars ground to a halt. And just as the song ended, wouldn't you know it, the pile of documents I had stuffed under my arm spilled out in front of me. For a moment, the only sounds in the room were grunting and smacking, and then it was me screaming at the pile of paper on the floor.

Both the man and woman froze. The girl turned to look at me, but the man kept facing forward. I dashed for the door and tried to slam it open. When that failed, I twisted and tugged at the knob. But it was useless. I saw the lock above the knob and realized the door couldn't be opened from the inside without a key.

""Shit shit shit!"" I screamed, pulling and pushing and pounding my fist on the door in faint hope that someone would get me out of this awful situation. Around the corner, I could hear the man's belt buckle jingling as he slowly pulled his pants up and zipped them. I turned to see him walking calmly toward me, his face cast in shadow.

""You interrupted me,"" he said.

""I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say, I --""

""I don't give a shit what you have to say. You have trespassed on my property and you are an intruder.""

""I was sent here by my office. I just need to collect some --""

""Why don't you shut the fuck up. You're not collecting anything until I'm done fucking."" The man turned and started walking away, as if that had settled things.

I was left alone at the door, totally disregarded. I realized that in seconds, he'd have his pants down again, and if I was going to get out of this situation, I'd better say something fast. I followed him back toward his mount, stopping to collect my papers.

""Excuse me, sir,"" I said. ""I don't want to disturb you any longer. If you could just open the door, I'll be on my way and we'll get the signatures from you some other time.""

""Nope,"" he replied. ""You're not going anywhere. Go cower in the corner if you want, or stay here and watch me. But I'm full of cum and these bitches need to be bred, so that's gonna get done."" And with that, he dropped his pants and exposed his penis to me, then turned and slid it back into the girl.""

And there I was again, standing there watching, this time in plain view. I could have done as he suggested, I suppose, and cowered by the door waiting for him to finish. But in the moment, that seemed really stupid. Almost immature. He was acting totally unphased, and it made me feel ridiculous for freaking out.

So I stood there. And I watched..."

I really want to do something productive this summer, but to be quite honest I'm not sure where to start looking especially because I've never done a legit internship/researched anything before. I'm a Physics major (okay, I haven't taken Physics 7a yet so this might change but I highly doubt it, I took Physics honors and AP in high school and studied my Physics textbook and it's definitely stuff I can handle and thoroughly enjoy) potentially interested in going to law in the distant future... My grades weren't that spectacular this semester (above a 3.0 at least though) because of some family-related issues I was dealing with so there's probably not a chance that I can get a sparkling recommendation or anything.

Is there any way I can land a good internship or, better yet, [starter] research position as a rising sophomore (with okay grades and no experience) in the summer, or should I just bite the bullet and just go back home and get a job in retail or fast food or whatever for Summer 2013? Where should I look and who should I talk to?

Of course, I'm going to make an appointment to go see L&amp;S/Department of Physics advising and chat with the advisors when we all get back and I'm definitely going to consult them about this matter, but I just thought I'd ask on here first since there's so many helpful comments I've read on here already.

Sorry if I sound ignorant or overly hopeful in my post, I just really want to put myself out there during this upcoming summer and do something that will make me feel productive and useful.
I guess it doesn't have to fall into the categories of internships or research positions if it will contribute to my college career.

Throughout high school, I hardly did anything besides play WoW.  College, though, really changed things for me.  I began exercising, competed in ballroom dance, made wonderful friends, and met the most amazing woman in the whole world.  After almost 3 years, she broke up with me a week ago and I've been even more of a mess ever since.  My anxiety was out of control before, however, and I don't blame her for needing to distance herself from me.  Anyway, back to my story.

i mentioned before that I've always been an anxious person, but never has it been as bad as it has this past year.  It started last year around this time when I had my first panic attack.  I laid down to sleep and I was unusually aware of my heartbeat.  I also developed this strange sensation in my left arm and chest.  I couldn't get the idea that I was having a heart attack out of my head.  After a visit to the ER and an Ativan, I was sent home with the full understanding that my symptoms were caused by anxiety.  

But knowing that it was anxiety didn't help me.  I would go on to have panic attacks almost every night after that for the remainder of the Spring semester of Junior year.  My grades fell, my friendships dwindled, my relationship with my girlfriend strained.  I couldn't get to class since I would be up until 5am having a panic attack and then sleep until 3pm.  I would wake up and be anxious and just sit at my computer trying to distract myself.  I visited the ER countless times because each time I was CONVINCED that I was having a heart attack.

Junior year finally ended and I managed (somehow) to get an internship for the summer.  And for almost the entirety of my internship, my anxiety was nonexistent.  I flew across the country and worked in a state I had never been to with people I had never met before doing scientific research at a fairly high level and I WASN'T ANXIOUS!  I didn't have a single panic attack until one of the days prior to the day my deliverables were due when I woke with an irregular heartbeat due to the stress I had been under (at the time, I thought I was dying, of course).  But it was amazing, I had virtually no anxiety the entire time I was there.  

The summer ends and I realized that I have a gluten intolerance.  For years I've had incredibly bad gas and heartburn, but I never connected the dots until one night when I had Turkey Tetrazzini and had gas so painful and heartburn so fierce that I couldn't spend time with the people I was with.  Anyway, I went gluten-free and my gas/heartburn went away overnight.  

And then I had the best 6 weeks of my entire life.  It was the start of my Senior year and I hit it hard.  My classes were going better than ever, I was exercising 3-4 times a week, I was gaining muscle mass and feeling good about my body, my relationship with my girlfriend was amazing, and I was eating very well and gluten-free.  I felt so great about everything.  

I had the worst night of my life after those 6 awesome weeks.  Seemingly out of the blue, I started to feel incredibly nauseous.  The more I thought about it, the worse it got and after 5 hours of horrible bowel movements and incredible nausea, I went to the ER and they told me I was fine.  But my mind wouldn't stop.  What if I have cancer?  What if I have something serious that needs to be discovered ASAP?  I googled a hundred diseases and thought I had stomach cancer one day and thyroid cancer the next.  Also, I noticed that I had ""Jock itch"" and instead of realizing that it was harmless, I began to have trickles of anxious thoughts.  What if it's testicular cancer?  What if it's testicular torsion?  What's wrong with me?   The thoughts wouldn't stop.

This was when the anxiety began.  This constant feeling in my head and stomach that has ruined my life over these past few months.  Sometimes, my stomach even feels like it's on fire.  I haven't been hungry in months, I've lost 24 pounds (172 -&gt; 148 in three months, I'm 6' 1""), I had to withdraw from the semester and now I'm worried that I won't be able to return for the spring, my girlfriend dumped me a week ago, and I still can't seem to stop this anxious feeling.  I know it's anxiety but it won't stop.  

1.5 months ago, my doctor put me on Lexapro to help the anxiety.  It worked for the first few weeks or so, but the anxiety returned.  I continued to take the Lexapro until about two weeks ago when I stopped cold turkey.  I don't want to take medication unless it's the only solution anyway, and it wasn't helping.  I'm trying supplements that are supposed to help the thyroid and digestion because I'm desperate.  I'm seeing a psychologist and working with my doctors to figure this all out, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better yet.

I just can't keep living like this.  I'm terrified because I keep losing weight and I haven't been hungry for months, but I do try to eat quite a bit.  Can anyone help?  Has anyone been through this?  I've been ""cracking"" my neck for years, can that cause anxiety problems?  I can't seem to stop crying and I'm so scared.  I really need help.

TL;DR: Please read it because I could really use some help."

However, I don't have much concrete information regarding how doable this is.  I'm at a pretty good University, with a 3.3 GPA, and my questions to you are:

1. What sort of qualifications do grad schools want for engineering applicants (i.e. research, internships, grades, GREs, etc.).

2. I've heard it's very hard to get financial support (work study, aid, etc.) for an engineering student, as its such a popular choice.

3. How hard would it be to get a relevant internship?  I'm putting together applications, and have a small amount of research experience, but I'm really nervous for this, especially since I'm pretty late and my undergrad major is not engineering.  Ideally I'd like to get paid, and explore some of my interests and try to pin down a specific area I'd like to study.

I am currently doing a year long internship at a telecom company in Canada that specializes in mobile phones. I am the Scrum Master for 2 development teams and also work with the department manager in maintaining the high level goal success rate of the department. I make the test cases for regression testing  and perform some manual regression tests myself. I also get to sit in the brain storming sessions with the Product Owner (Project Manager) and the various BAs and try and find solutions for the business requirements. I design/re-design existing GUI based on the current changes, make user-stories and write the acceptance criteria and make GUI mock-ups for the developers. Also I do the documentation such as release notes and maintaining the kan-ban board on tools such as Rally and Jira. 

I hopefully should have passed the CAPM before my work term is done and will be graduating with a bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems early next year. I also have a Computer Science degree too. 

What kind of jobs should I look at? I'm pretty sure I won't get a role as a Project Manager with just a year of intern experience. I really don't want to start at a developers position. I really don't enjoy coding so much, I like dynamic roles where I am part of the bigger picture. I hope to hear your suggestions. Thanks"

I'm wondering which would give more more help in searching for a position, starting ""early"", or waiting until I finish my final semester and likely having a 3.0+ GPA by then. 

How much of a difference is that cutoff going to make for landing interviews? 

Related to that, say I did apply to some companies I'm looking forward to working for now. If I do not even land an interview (perhaps due to the above cutoff) is it possible to reapply after that additional semester, or should I consider that opportunity gone?

There are a couple of classes that I'm taking that deal with material that I may be able to use in interviews but at this point the vast majority of the classes dealing with my fields of interest has been taken.

Edit 1: Just to clarify, this is for a search for a full time position as I am graduating this year. Also I have had an internship for 4 years at a small local company. It is 4 years of work experience and it has taught me some interesting skills (PCB layout) but that doesn't directly deal with the fields I'm most interesting in applying for (FPGA or Embedded System Design).

At this moment I'm halfway through my junior year of a BS degree in Computer Information Systems, a little behind on courses because I was originally a Communication major (relevant!). I'll graduate on time, all requirements completed, but with very little interest in systems administration, networking, computer security or programming.

I worked for about a year and a half in NOC/HD within IT and I'm doing an internship in automated software testing at the moment. I've made attempts to teach myself programming concepts that haven't been touched on in classes but I just don't enjoy programming and don't see it as a possible career outlook for me right now.

Concern:

As of right now I'm looking into opportunities in the field that differ from what I've tried and researched already, and how I could best prepare myself for employment in that sector. I really, really enjoy writing and would definitely be interested in an opportunity to write full-time in a technical environment. I'm also familiar with the roles of BA/PM and I was just looking to see if anyone might have some additional insight.

As a side note, I wouldn't be opposed to scripting or light programming as a result of the position -- I just don't want to be doing so for the majority of my day.

My choices for careers are as follows: manicurist, a job which makes a measly 16k per year if IIRC but sounds fun; veterinary technician, a field which I was previously on fire with passion for, but which a confusing episode observing/volunteering at a vet clinic which ended in sudden rejection has left me too heartbroken to try; and speech therapist, a field which I know very little about and which my parents are strongly encouraging me to enter.

Can Reddit help a guy get his money back?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15spy8/my_housemate_wont_return_my_375_security_deposit/,"So here's some background information.

I'm a 20 year old film student from Australia and as a part of my course i decided to complete an internship in Los Angeles, CA. I saved up lots of money and finally flew out for three months in early October. 

Accommodation wise, i chose to find a place that was fully furnished (something with a bed provided since i couldnt exactly bring my own from australia). So i browsed Airbnb.com for months before and finally found a shared house with its own private bed near my place of internship. It was a short bus ride away and it was $900 a month, the cheapest place i could find! So i met up with the guy and he was a nice guy, a bit paranoid, but he agreed and we went ahead with the airbnb transaction. The night i got there, he told me he needed the security deposit..and he was eager to get it or else i couldn't get the keys. So we took a trip to the bank, and i withdrew the $375 needed for the 3 month lease. I gave it to him, and he put it in an envelope. 

Now comes the main part... 

This guy, his name is Akil Thompson, wasn't the best housemate. He was constantly knocking on my door asking for things, he would also go through my room to get to his extra storage. He was very flambouyant and would sing loudly every night, even at 11pm. And his wifi would cut out constantly...It was very hard living with him especially since he never stipulated in his airbnb post that he would be doing these things. Infact, he said he's a quiet respectable person. Whatever, i just pushed through these annoying living conditions and minded my own business. 

So just before Christmas i told him that my 3 months is coming to an end and that i'd be returning to Australia in the first week of January. I told him that i'm going to clean my room and put everything back to how it was. Throughout my stay, i never broke, damaged or stole anything! I was completely respectful and he knew i was! He constantly said i was a nice, easy going housemate. So the day came and i showed him my room and told him everything is back to how he first had it. 
I even cleaned the floor and washed all his towels and bed sheets!

Then... he told me he didnt have my security deposit. The odd part is that the first night i gave him the money in cash, right? Well apparently the room i was staying in actually belongs to a girl who is currently in japan.. so he sent all the money to her, because technically i was staying in her room. 

Now i didn't care where the money was, but i needed that money before i left. He agreed to it..and so did I. 

So the day i leave i tell him, Hey Akil.. i'm off to new york before i leave for Australia and I NEED that money now. 

He kept saying he didnt have the money and that the japanese girl wont get back to him. 

I told him..that's not my problem. I gave you my money.. and since there is no damage, I need my money back..or else that's considered stealing.

So he said he'd give it the day i get to new york..and i've been here for 4 days and he is ignoring all my calls and emails. 

I have a feeling he wont give me the money and it'll be too late.

15x1l4,2,2013-01-03,Worthless Education System?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15x1l4/worthless_education_system/,"I am an undergraduate university student about to graduate with a finance degree and I just don't see the value of my education. Don't get me wrong, I am very knowledgeable about my subject area, I get decent grades, I work hard, I try to network actively outside of school, and I even have previous internship experience. 

However, when I apply for positions in my field I do not even get a call back for an interview. Even in situations where I have networked and have some connection to the hiring manager; there is always someone ""with more experience"" or someone they know even better that they pick for the job. 

I want and am willing to start at the bottom to get my foot in the door, but the door is locked. I pursued an undergraduate education to get the key but it turns out in these economic times I need to pursue an MBA AND obtain some sort of finance designation to even ""get my foot in the door"".

This results in more time and money spent on education on top of the thousands of dollars I already owe in debt. The worst part is, by the time I get these credentials I fear they might not even be enough. 

You might say ""get some experience instead of degrees"" but that's the problem, I CAN'T get any experience, I've been working hard trying, even going as far as to walking into businesses dropping off my resume and talking to the owners.

I am not one of those people who believes that I am entitled to anything, but with the risk of going bankrupt before I even get my first full-time job, I want to feel that I at least ""bought"" something."

The first three or so were pretty great, he lived about 20 minutes away, so we'd see each other about 3-4 times a week, go to shows, go to art galleries, go to parties, etc. He was occasionally moody or cold and has suffered from depression in the past, having been in inpatient treatment when he was 17, and dropping out of college when he was 19 as a result.

Suddenly, in early December, our relationship started going to shit. I was taking a ton of Vivance and Adderral, which make me super anxious, trying to balance a full-time course-load's worth of finals at a challenging university with working four nights a week at a restaurant, managing my college's radio station, and working at two internships. I was stressed, I was needy, I was at his house every night and needed constant reassurance. At this time, he became cold, would never initiate sex, would elect to sit on the computer and play dumb-ass games instead of interacting with me when I was there, and was often rude to me. One day, after he rolled off of me during sex without finishing, I asked him if he wanted to break up. And he said, ""Yes, I think, for a while now, you have liked me a lot more than I like you and I've been waiting to feel something."" He was cold and perhaps even smug during the breakup, and when I asked him why he was so goddamn apathetic, he responded that he feels that way about most things. He gave me my shit back without ceremony, sent me on my way, and we hadn't talked since this point. I asked if he wanted to see if he felt different within a week and just take a break and he said ""no, because it will just prolong the inevitable. It's not like we were going to get married. We had a good run."" etc., etc.

Two days ago, he texted me ""I miss you and I'm sorry."" Basically told me that he felt that way ""because of his own inability to care that the time.

Something out of left-field because he has always been cold and poor at demonstrating sentiment, ""I can't stop thinking about you.""

Phone conversation went poorly generally, as it was like pulling teeth. I'm visiting family so we can't have a face-to-face interaction until Monday.

Should I even indulge this behavior? I feel like a sucker. I was the one broken up with, I feel like he's exploiting the fact that I blatantly still have feelings and is fickle.

I'm a long time lurker, first time poster. I'd like to become an actuary but I'm not sure what would be the best way to enter the field for someone in my circumstances.

Education background: BS in Math (3.4 GPA) and, as of 7 months ago, a MS in Applied Statistics (3.7 GPA)

Work background: I've had two internships that were unrelated to the actuarial field. I was a research intern for the assessment and accountability department for a major city's public school system, and I was a research &amp; data analyst intern for a green nonprofit. I've also spent a full year as an employee at the same green nonprofit.

Exam background: I passed exam P a few months back and I'll be re-taking the FM in February. Considering my degree, the P was super-duper easy, so I underestimated the FM the first time I took it and didn't allocate enough time for studying. Lesson learned.

Browsing through Indeed and Monster for my current state and my home state, there are few entry-level openings. I have savings and very little debt, so I'd be willing and able to take an internship, as long as it helped me land a permanent job. However, most/all of the listings I see for internships are for this coming summer and I'd rather not wait that long. From what I've read on here, emailing directly about internships can be successful.

Given my circumstances, how should I be looking to enter the actuary job market? Since I'd prefer an entry-level job but would settle for an internship, how should I communicate that to potential employers? Is it a good idea to communicate that I'd be interested in anything available?

Thanks in advance!"

I feel very overwhelmed!!!,em114,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/15wouw/please_help_i_really_need_advice_on_the_path_i_am/,"Okay so this may be a very unorganized summary of my situation because I am just going to try to list some of the things I am confused about. I am sorry in advance! 

-I am currently an sophomore undergraduate from USA

-I transferred after my freshman year because I hated my school. I had a 3.85 GPA when I left my first university but my GPA didn't transfer to my new school. I didn't do that good this semester and ended with a 3.45 GPA. So now, I don't have my first year of easier intro classes and general education classes to boost my cumulative GPA. Will medical schools use only the GPA from my current school or will they also consider my freshman GPA also?

-So far I have taken: Intro to Biology, General Chemistry 1&amp;2, Zoology, Calculus 1, Organic Chem 1, Cellular Biology, Ecology and Evolution and some general education requirements. I will be taking in this next semester: Honors Organic Chem 2, Microbiology, Genetics, Psychology and Statistics

-I have quickly read through the rice pre-med guide a few times and have seen that the recommend taking the MCAT the summer after sophomore year. However, I have not taken any physics yet nor did I take any during high school. I do not feel like I am prepared to take it this upcoming summer so I was planning on trying to do a summer internship or volunteer work instead. However, I also do not feel like I will be able to pull off taking the MCAT during my junior year because I think I will get overwhelmed if I have to balance school work and studying for the test. Can I take the MCAT the summer after junior year? Will this put me behind in any way?

-I have not done any research yet and I do not really understand how to get involved in it. I've asked some professors and they've all said they don't mentor undergraduates or want them in their lab. Who should I ask?

-I am going to begin working as a scribe in an ER this semester and I volunteer at a free clinic. I am going to try to shadow doctors this summer. I joined the premed and biology club at my school. Are these all good choices? Is there anything else I should be doing?

-I've heard from people that calling medical schools you are interested in is beneficial because they will start a file on you and when they are reviewing your application it shows you've shown interest in the past. Is this true? If so, what do you ask? Basic admission questions seems detrimental to me because you could easily find all of that information online. I feel like it would show that you are not very resourceful.

I am sure I have more questions that I am just not thinking of right now but I would REALLLLY appreciate all of the advice you can give me. I don't have anyone close to me who has gone through this process so I don't really know who else to ask other that you guys. Thank you in advance and I wish you all the best of luck with your journey also!!"

While on the shows website I saw they had a free preview. 

Overall, I thought the show was pretty...annoying. I get why these shop owners were chosen-they're kinda like  grown up Honey Boo Boo's. They aren't shown doing any real measurements and it's not explained to any of the customers why their current bras don't fit. Obviously these women run a successful lingerie business, so they can't be nearly as dumb as they're portrayed. 

One of my biggest problems with the show was their intern. She's a petite big boobed girl that is supposed to be the ""bimbo"" of the show. She was helping a customer with a similar body type and made a comment along the lines of, ""i just love helping women like you, its like dressing up a barbie doll! I believe everyone has the right to wear lingerie but sometimes its just like ewww gross!!."" 

Pretty insensitive if you ask me. I have a feeling that the show is going to be more for men who wanna see hot chicks try on sexy lingerie and people who wanna laugh at the store owners ridiculousness. 

But...it was only the first episode...maybe it'll get better.

It usually comes back to the basic argument ""we were lied to and brought up to believe that simply attending college would secure us a job"", but is that really so?

While i do believe we were brought up with this concept, it feels as if too many people feel they are entitled to a career upon graduating college, without any real work.

I am a bit bias since i happen to have aligned myself with people who worked hard to get good grades and looked for employment well before graduation.  But i would like to know what people think.

I personally believe that college really is a ticket to a better future, but its not a given, you must work for it. This means you need to straighten up your act and focus.

* Pick a major that will actually get you employed
* Make sure you actually pay attention and get good grades
* Network and look for employment before graduation, internships are a awesome

And i think any major is viable, but some definately have a higher chance of getting you a nice check: Engineering, Finance, Accounting and so on.

So what do you think Reddit? Do people just feel entitled to a career because they went to school? even those who barely make grades and pick majors for which they cant even answer ""What do you want to do when you graduate?""

I am currently a junior in Chemical Engineering, and I've begun to look for my first real engineering internship. I wrote this resume and I've tried to make it look better than it is, but honestly, I don't feel like I've done anything other than school and basic research. 

What do you guys think? And I know it looks bad, that's what happens when I put a pdf in imgur apparently. It looks much better on my pdf.

15w4f3,3,2013-01-03,We feel the same way but he wants to give up before even trying,[deleted],wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/15w4f3/we_feel_the_same_way_but_he_wants_to_give_up/,"we only met 2 months ago but feel the same way about each other. the problem is that he doesn't believe it could work but I do. we live on different continents, and neither of us want to do a long distance relationship.  we already said we would take things slow and just chill before anything gets too serious, as we had been heavily flirting for the first month or so.

I'm a third culture kid. my dad's a diplomat so I've lived in many different countries and even the country where I live now where I'm going to college is only temporary and after I'm done with my studies I will go away and don't know where to yet. I have no 'home' because my own 'hometown' is almost as foreign to me as any other country. So essentially, moving countries is not really a 'big deal' to me, in fact, I need to go SOMEWHERE after I finish college.

As part of my studies I have to do either an exchange semester or internship for 5 months. I already got a placement but I'm unhappy with it, and have been thinking of doing an internship as well. The thing is, and I didn't wanna tell him this to freak him out, but I could try (and would probably succeed) to get an internship in his home country. Which would give us the possibility of being together. 

So we kind of had 'the talk' right now because he has been acting very distant and unresponsive, so he finally told me that he's having serious doubts. I told him he's just giving up, I mean it's obvious we both care about each other the same way and thikn of what could be etc. but he said he doesn't want to do LDR just like that and I said me neither, we could just be friends.

So he almost gave up on me but I managed to save it. My idea is that for now we'll just be friends because even talking about making a commitment seems to be too risky. But at the same time, if this is something real, we can just be friends, no pressure, while simultaneously both harboring feelings for the other. 

Now I would like to hear you guys' thoughts on that. Has anyone else done it this way and do you think it's a good idea? Should I try to get an internship in his home country (also, important note is that I have thought about living in that country long before I knew about him, so it wouldn't be JUST for him). Do you think we will still feel this way about each other if we are only internet friends?"

Last time around, when I was looking for design work, I was faced with a tough economy and few opportunities to even get my foot in the door. This time around, I'm not anticipating anything better, so I want to see how best to approach this search. In my mind, network is key, but I'm new to social media, and I'd like to hear from other professionals about getting into the field.  
  
Here's the lowdown on me, but I'd say this would be a great thread for general advice for all career levels, not just entry level. I've got a BFA in New Media Design, I'm finishing up a MS in Information Management and a CAS in Social Media. I've got a bit of experience, including an internship at Likeable Media, I managed a very small but successful awareness campaign for a class project, and I've been doing some strategy and community management work for the IT group at my university. I'd hope that makes me a decent candidate, but I don't know how much faith I should put into a decent resume these days.  
  
What I'm looking for is probably a community management position, as that's what I gather is the typical starting point in this field. I'd love to work up to strategy, in a few years of course. I have a few companies in mind already, looking mainly at NYC, but one of the difficulties I've found is that it's not always so easy to see who's behind your favorite social campaigns. I may be missing some big players because the brand gets the recognition moreso than the agency.  
  
So, what can a guy like me do to break into social media professionally? Like I said, I tend to put my network, and I've got some connections already, but what are some surefire ways to get noticed in this field? I really love to brew coffee, and I've got a kit that fits in a carry-on suitcase (i.e. travel friendly), would that be an interesting way to snag a meeting with somebody, or is it just too pushy?* A few folks I trust mentioned that it may be a bit too early to apply for a June start date, unlike other fields - is that true?  
  
Anything you've got, I'm sure the community would appreciate. Thanks in advance, folks!  
  
*If it helps, I've given [talks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jg6sbNR5sM) on coffee and community, tied into a project I started about this time last year. So the coffee thing would actually be relevant to social, but I'm not sure if I should play that card or not."
15vzhl,2,2013-01-03,On the verge of breaking NC. Shaking of anger and crying. Why do I still care?,angermanagement_1,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/15vzhl/on_the_verge_of_breaking_nc_shaking_of_anger_and/,"I told myself I was going to be over this in 2013. I'm so incredibly angry and full of pain over what he did/what he's doing and I want to hurt him so badly, why can't I let go?

I [25f] broke up with him [23m] on Nov 8th because I didn't feel supported and felt hurt by his lack of faith in our relationship. He had previously moved to London, and I was in the stage of rounding up my thesis and graduation and finding a job there (not an easy thing to do).

He was my future, we felt so solid, I felt like nothing could break us. I was looking forward to coming to London and getting to a more serious stage with him (moving in together). But the cracks in our relationship had already started showing:

* after moving to London he would seek out friendships with girls only. I knew going in to the relationship that he had a lot of female friends but to see him seeking out new contacts with women made me feel like he was keeping his options open
* after an especially emotional day where I buried my grandmother I couldn't sleep that night and couldn't stop crying. He was with me that night, noticed I was crying, and fell asleep on me. I found it nearly impossible to form any sort of emotional connection with him
* he took me out to his hometown in the summer where I met his family and friends. I noticed he was texting/emailing a lot. Being a bad gf, I read his private FB messages with one of his female London friends. He was taking her out to concerts, initializing conversation every day, sending her sweet thoughtful jokes and stories (exactly how we had started out). Didn't confront him with it but proceeded to feel like shit in front of his friends and family that he was keeping his options open like this.
* I had to fly back to Europe earlier than he. He was still hanging out with his ex-gf a lot in his hometown, one day he lied about meeting up with her and a few friends while it was really meeting up with her to ""finally have a proper talk"". I caught him out on it, he felt like shit for lying to me, I managed to tell him that I was okay with him meeting up with his ex, but that he should be honest about it and that I wanted us to have the kind of relationship where he would speak to me about what he was going through emotionally. Seemed like we hit a breaking point, he emailed me every day saying how confident he was about us, changed his profile pic into one of us two
* he came back to London, removed his FB profile pic of us both together, started his new job which he was quite busy with. Drank himself into a stupor 4 nights a week, went to the gym on 2 others, ignored me as much as possible on the remaining night
* he took a year's lease on his apartment, effectively killing the option of me doing an internship in London in case I couldn't find a job
* he was getting short with me in his answers, didn't enquire about my thesis or job search. When I told him how unhappy I was, he said he just didn't know how long he could go on long distance and if I couldn't find a job in London, well, then he wasn't so sure about how long he wanted us to continue for.
* as a final attempt, I flew last minute to London (came there regularly) to talk things out face to face, see what he was feeling, see if it was still something worth fighting for. I asked him if he thought we would be okay, if he was willing to wait for me to try and make a future for myself in London. He said he loved me and of course he wanted to wait! But couldn't promise me his shitty behaviour of the past few months was going to fade away, because that's just how he felt.

I broke up with him because of his shitty attitude and lack of support and well, all the things mentioned above which made me feel I was better off without him. It was an incredibly sad break up. I remember telling him “I’d rather be alone than feel afraid you’re going to break up with me every single day”. Not feeling the support of your SO during important changes in your life is a shitty thing to feel. I couldn’t stop crying at the airport; normally a place of excitement and lovingness, feeling loved and missing him, now I just felt miserable and empty. I made a note on my phone saying “what good is a world without love?” I didn’t understand his lack of support and his lack of caring. I felt resolved in my decision to end it on my terms because even if I had found my way to London within the next few months, his lack of support would have always stuck with me.

Still, I am incredibly hurt. I heard via a friend, that he asked out the London girl he was msging 7 days after we broke up. 7 days. They are dating now. 

The problem is, is that I am hearing through one of his close friend (that I became friends with as well), is that he broke it off because **I wanted to stay in my hometown and get working experience before coming over to London. He is making it out as if I'm the one who didn't put in the effort to make things work. His friends are now complimenting him for being such a romantic, cheering him on for keeping the relationship going for as long as he did, and he is telling them how difficult it is for him being in the dating scene again because he's not good at casual dating.** Obviously, I need to cut off contact with this mutual friend, but for some reason my brain things it's the only way to find answers for the hurt and anger that I am feeling.

He pulled out of a 2,5 year relationship just because he couldn't wait another 6 months to let me find my way and start a career. He started dating option #2 **SEVEN** days after we ended things! How can he see himself as a romantic????!!! HOW? How is he getting away with this?

When he first came to London, he was very lonely, and was very confused about leaving his hometown and wanting to go back. I was there for him, asked him how he was feeling every single day, and completely supported him in his wishes to go back to his home country as I saw how unhappy it made him. I have always told him we would work out, whether it was in Europe or somewhere else, we would find a way to be together. It just feels like once he got his job, and found people to drink/socialize with, he wasn't interested in me anymore. It sucks to be put aside this way.

I hate myself because I felt so strong after I dumped him. I knew this wasn't the type of guy I wanted and I wanted to feel a stronger connection to somebody. This feeling is gone. I unfriended him from FB but feel the urge to still check his page through mutual friends FB. Peeked on the FB of a friend while she was away and saw his photos. With the new girl. His friends, whom I met over the summer, telling him how excited they are about his new love and good for him that he is having such a good time in London.

And me, I'm just shaking with anger and crying because I loved him so much and felt he was the real deal for such a long time and told all my family and friends about moving to London.

I want to hurt him. I want to send him an email saying what a jackass he is, how much he has hurt me with everything, how he's only fooling himself with his ""i'm such a romantic"" shit. 

WHY DO I STILL CARE?
Throwaway because I’m too embarrassed I’m still not able to deal with this shit. But I’m really active in the r/BreakUps community and always know what to say in other people’s situations, just not mine.
If anyone has anything helpful to say or experiences to share, please let me know.

I'm a Computer Science student, and recently I've landed a job for the summer at a pretty great Company, a company that is known for bringing hard working interns back each summer until they graduate and commonly providing them with full time jobs.  However, I've also been given the opportunity to work at a well known International Giant in the Computer Science industry, a company I'll refer to as IG.  The travel opportunities and pay are much much greater for me if I take the job at IG, however, as a downside, I will lose my good standing with my current employer for the summer and possibly lose the chance to work at that company altogether (many companies are judged by how many offers potential employees accept, so refusing a job offer would make them look bad and deter them from offering a job to me in the future expecting that I would again turn it down and go to another company) but IG is not necessarily known for bringing interns back for future summer positions.  What would be a wise course of action in this situation? Stick with my current company (which is no doubt fantastic in its own right) and keep job security, or take the job at IG for better pay, travel opportunities and the overall experience but sacrifice the reassurance of having a job at graduation?

Note: For good (and hopefully obvious) reason, I have not mentioned the names of the Companies"

I am all sorts of excited to graduate in May with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from a state school known for it's engineering department.


**My elevator pitch**


I am currently in the thick of a job search, and I am looking for ideas as well as specific positions to apply for. I am really interested in an industry where designers, visionaries, and engineers all work closely together to realize a product that is user-centric and ideally fun!

This product might take the form of a website, an application, or even a physical object. In my opinion, the most wonderful part of Computer Engineering is allowing a way for the physical world and the digital world to communicate.  I would like to be involved in a product that strives to provide a novel, positive, and exciting experience to people.


**What I'm good at**


* Strong in Java (android) and C++
* Coursework in embedded design (ARM, Arduino)
* Love to work with Processing/ OpenFrameworks making artistic tech projects
* Comfortable on Windows/ Linux (and mac is probably cool too.)
* One summer internship as a Software Dev (C++)
* Two apps on the Android market (freelance)
* Working on a portfolio website to teach myself html/ css/ javascript

**Where I want to work**


* Seattle/ Portland area
* San Francisco
* New York
* Europe (my dream)
* Denver (IF it's the right job)

**What else I like**


* Music, literature, philosophy
* Traveling
* Skiing, hiking, rock climbing
* Good coffee and food


I think that covers it... Hopefully this isn't too meta, but I am really hoping some good ideas come out of this.  I am still very much in flux about what I want to do with my life, so this is a chance to mold a young and excited mind! 

OK, anyway, message me if you have any ideas/ tips/ job openings I might be interested in. I can provide more details as needed.

Thanks r/forhire, here goes nothing..."

Well a few interviews later I get an offer this morning, they're giving me until tomorrow morning to make a decision. I don't know what to do because I've technically committed to summer work at my current employer, and backing out now may end up hurting my currently good reputation at this non-profit, however this internship provides better experience and better pay. I wish to continue working at this non-profit during the school year, while trying to branch out during the summers. Another thing weighing on my mind is that this internship is in a city that is away from my social circle, family, and girlfriend, and I'd essentially be alone for the entire summer, whereas my current job is closer to the town my college is in where I will have friends and my girlfriend studying during at least part of the summer. I'm really torn, and I have little time to think about it, I have to let them know early tomorrow morning if I'm going to take it or not. Any advice or suggestions?

Since software opportunities came up, and my past experiences match software better, I decided to pursue software opportunities.

As it turns out, I have an attribute mismatch with software industry demands, despite of my efforts to force-feed my personality to fit them. Long story short, I've worked myself out of software professionally. I felt lost on whether I would need retraining/additional training in a certain area before I am qualified enough to obtain a job offer with an EIT opportunity. Also, I heard of a statistic saying that if the graduate didn't start the first EIT job soon after, the chances of getting one are slim.

Programming for 4 months. Really loving it and sticking with it. Could definitely do it for a career. Don't have any decent projects done yet.

Managed a student group website and social media, gave presentations, and had some leadership and decision making opportunities.

I butter things up in the resume and cover letter obviously but that's the meat of it. Until recently, I've had almost steady employment, just jumping from medical jobs to media jobs. Not only can I not find a position in my degree field, I can't even land basic office-type jobs. 

I really want to switch to programming, but I would like something in between now and then, because I'd guess it'd take another 6 months to 2 years to be a really solid candidate for that kind of work. I've talked to all of the local TV and radio stations and they aren't looking for anyone with only internship experience for production/editing/master-control.

I'm also generally unhappy with everything else in life. Lack of friends, relationships, things to do. I don't think I'm depressed yet, but I'm getting there after 7 months without a good job offer. I try not to appear or sound depressed, but it's amazing how much career satisfaction affects satisfaction in other areas. I'm not special, but I'm not an idiot either -- and believe me, I've met some real idiots who make great salaries.

Not yet sure what I want to do",[deleted],GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/15vasp/best_ways_to_be_proactive_in_looking_for_job_not/,"I would appreciate any help from redditors on figuring out how I should be proactive in looking for a job, and which careers I should most actively pursue.

I graduated several weeks ago from the UCSB with a 3.7 GPA (rounded up) and an Economics and History double major. I've had 2 internships for companies related to the financial services industry (one where I worked for a small startup, the other assisting a financial advisor) but haven't lined up a job before graduating.

My resume looks good. I've been in several quality student organizations and have had decent internship experience. Interviewers tend to compliment me on my resume and I am confident in face-to-face situations with potential employers. 

However, I by no means know yet what I want to do with my life, and really just want to put my foot in the door of the professional world with a solid first job (whatever the field). I'd also really like to live in the LA area, but beggars can't be choosers, so I could settle for SF or elsewhere if necessary.

I can do quantitative analysis, but I'm much stronger verbally. Thus, I've been submitting my cover letters primarily to LA-based firms (who advertise on my university's career-recruiting website, Gaucholink) for positions that require both qualitative/quantitative analysis, but tend to emphasize writing skills.

However, aside from the last career fair that I went to (where I  scored my last internship) my current employment-seeking methods seem relatively impotent.  Before my university's next career fair in late January, I'd like to ""get my name out there"" to as many companies as possible, in a way where my efforts will have the highest possible payoff (it's disconcerting to spend the time and effort writing cover letters you are almost certain will be futile). 


**TL;DNR**: I have some marketable skills/experience but want to market them more effectively. I am uncertain of what jobs I should look for.

How should I approach companies in a proactive way? Is there anyone at the company I should email or call? 

And in today's tough job market, which types of companies should I apply to?"

-Where did you recent hires or grizzled veterans do your internships? What did you do?

 -How did you find them?

* Went to school from 2005-2009 for Construction Management.

* Summers of 2007 &amp; 2008 I landed an internship with a great contractor doing ""Project Engineer"" work (mostly RFI's, submittals, change orders, estimating, etc.), and another internship involving building usage on campus.

* 2009 came, I graduated and the commercial contractor didn't have any space to hire, and had downsized a lot. Anyone else I interviewed with or applied to told me I was SOL. I ended up getting a great paying job in a factory making healthcare products, allowing me to live on my own and start paying off my loans. The company got bought out and was closing down.

* 2011 I spent 4 months cycling across europe and iceland, then returned to a position as a Quality Assurance Analyst temp for an ad company for about 6 months.

* 2012 to the Present, I've been working at a Law Firm as a legal assistant dealing with personal injury, med mal and a couple of construction malpractice cases, more involving liability though (Salaried Full Time).

I've applied around constantly for a chance to get back into the CM field but I really haven't had much luck, mostly as I haven't had much experience in it. I've networked around and had my resume pushed to contractors, architects, engineering firms etc. I might just be unsuccessful finding the right people. Here's what I've considered so far in an attempt to increase my chances:

* Get a CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management Certificate)
* Consider Construction Law as my background loosely involves both Law and Construction (Bonding, Surety etc.)
* See if a general contractor would be willing to let me temp?
* I've been using a general format resume and am drafting a skill-based resume at the moment.
* Go into project management, starting off with some kind of project coordinator position (which seem pretty common on a simple indeed.com search)

Any other advice would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: Thank you for the upvotes! I'll post my standard resume and skill based resume tonight in the chance that anyone's willing to provide feedback :-)."

Almost NOTHING could be had.  When finding out most of our frustrated Engineers started bringing in their wanted extra gear from home (and were encouraged by their management to do so), we finally got some extra room in the IT budget to allow each department their own little piggybank within IT.

Extra monitors, extra RAM, larger hard drives, special order PCs, Macbooks, etc, could now be had if that particular department wanted to use what was in their ""bank"".  We even managed to carve out a bit of the extra money for an IT ""toy"" fund.  Much less grumbling from cube-land and from the helpdesk.

However, we have had a couple unintended consequences, departments forget that the money still comes from IT and stuff they buy with it is ""ours"" and goes back into our inventory when a user leaves the company.  It also gives users the impression that limitations on gear were due to a technological limitation rather than a budgetary one.

Example 1: One of our departments loves buying extra monitors for interns that are only with us for a semester, then they get pissed off when I go return their 2nd monitor and 16GB of RAM workstation to my spare equipment rack... no wait, they get pissed when I tell them they need a new request for the new intern and spend the money again.  Moral of the story: don't buy this shit for temporary employees.

Example 2: Line manager puts in request for his new hire's equipment. Asks for a laptop with 2 monitors.  Nobody gets 2 monitors to start with (only 2 exceptions which don't apply here).  I inform him of this fact and he replies that ""I thought the policy changed since the newer model laptops support multiple external displays.""  Yes, because monitors grow on a tree I tend to behind the building and totally don't cost $200/ea.

Oh well, if I had wheels I'd be a wagon.

tl;dr lusers fail to understand that hardware costs money.  What money they do have for hardware shouldn't be spent on temporary employees.

**Edit:** Sorry guys, I'm not a corporate accountant and it's hard for me to explain how all this works.  I probably also should have tossed in a ""You Don't do the budget, Gary, I do!""  It's just a typical workday frustration for me since I have to be mindful of our client-tower spend (as usually I'm the first one on the chopping block if things go south.)"

Anyway, on one of the floors, a user pressed on the call help desk in the teleconference room. The guy I learn from, and help here and there picks up the phone, and sees its the fifth floor teleconference room. Some mumbo-jumbo talk with the caller, and I hear ""Try pressing and holding the power button. Then let go, and push the button."" To no avail, the user continues asking my pal to have him come upstairs. My pal responds ""I'll be right there."" As we take one flight up, he mentions that the caller said something about a computer not wanting to start up, and that he mentioned Dell. So I think to myself what could be going wrong here. The conference rooms are setup in a wooden panel. These panels include multiple switches for TVs, shades, screens, etc. (Fancy-shmancy stuff). I've interned here over the summer, and have seen sh*t hit the ceiling when one of these panels decides not to work.


We walk through the door, and my pal walks to the panel. He opens the panel, and presses the power button on the Dell. The TV automatically realizes the computer is being booted up, and shows us the Windows loading screen. The crowd inside the room goes wild! The user speaks turns to us and asks [""Where's the power button?? I kept pressing the big, silver Dell button, but it wouldn't turn on!!""](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Dell_Optiplex_745_standing.JPG)

The most obvious result is that their quality and range of work was significantly lower (this is not being judgmental, just a simple observation) than what I had experienced in school.

For those who also went to an art school, do you get the same reactions? Has the name of a particular school on your resume helped you in finding work at all? How do you think your experience in school has effected you as a designer?

For those who got their degrees from state schools or another institution (or didn't get a degree yet still are working) do people react to this? Do you feel you would have been better suited in an art-specific school rather than a small program in a larger school? Do you think it doesn't matter where you study as long as you half the drive and talent?

This is just out of curiosity for myself, but I think it might benefit those looking to get a degree in the future."

15ynao,12,2013-01-04,Meat and cheese? That's easy. That green leafy stuff? Not so sure. Picky eater needs help.,awwwwkward,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/15ynao/meat_and_cheese_thats_easy_that_green_leafy_stuff/,"Hey guys, Keto noob here!

Backstory: Lost about 40lbs over the course of a year with cardio 4-6x/week (60 minute sessions), simply eating “less,” and drinking *tons* of water. But then 4 months ago, I took on a full-time internship (which has now turned into a full-time job, yay!), and have ended up commuting 2+ hours each way (moving next week so no more commute) meaning I was getting to the gym *maybe* once a week, and went from eating out maybe 3x/week, to 2-3 meals *everyday*. This negative lifestyle change has added ~15lbs back on, and I feel like crap, constantly. 

After about seven months of following r/keto, yesterday I said “fuck it, I'm doing Keto!” Now, the meat and cheese? Piece of cake (figuratively speaking, of course). I'm the kind of of girl who loves eating steak for breakfast anyway.

The issue? Green stuff. I've always been a picky eater, for as long as my parents and I can remember. Over the past 3 years, my tastes have changed *significantly*. 4 years ago I started eating steaks, 2 years ago I started eating burgers, and just a few months ago I've started to enjoy salmon, not to mention eggs! Six months ago, I started eating eggs on a regular basis, first time since I was a kid (I hated the taste before and just something about eggs freaked me out. I'm well over that decade long phase). 

But back to point of this post … I need help. I need a way to help ease some green into my diet. Lettuce is out. It's mostly a texture thing, and I've tried, even when covered in dressing. All in all, I'm new to leafy greens and most veggies, and looking for advice or help on where I should start. Smothering broccoli in cheese? Drowning spinach in a pool of butter?  I've looked into dozens of recipes with cauliflower… using it in muffins, for rice, as mashed potatoes, etc… but does it actually taste like cauliflower? Sorry if this all seems ridiculous, but veggies and greens aren't a thing I'm accustomed to eating, and I really want to make this work and better myself, hence why I'm asking for advice. 

Any help, picker eaters of r/Keto?"

TL:DR
I went from rags to riches because of my passion for IT, and so can you. 

My Background: 
I worked for minimum wage for nearly 16 years. One day I lost everything and was forced to live in my car for several months. This was the catalyst that got me started in my field. I took a long hard look at my situation and decided to do something about it. I enrolled at the local community college.

I was elated about finally earning my degree. I worked full time loading trucks on the night shift while I went to school part time during the day. I did that for 4 years. However, when I graduated there were no jobs. There were no internships, not even unpaid ones. Even the volunteer IT jobs were void. And no business is going to hire someone with 0 experience to administer their network. I was heart broken. 

Then I got a job at a call center making 1$ above minimum wage. It was the most I ever made. I volunteered for extra shifts and stayed focused on my career goals the entire time. At one point I was working 14, 12 hour shifts with one day off in between. When I was on phone calls helping customers I was also reading books on kernel development, C, Python, Cisco, anything I could get my hands on.

Long story short, I worked 3 more IT jobs, was promoted twice at each one and now I make nearly 7 times as much as I did when I worked at that first call center. If I can do it, you can do it. Here is a list of the things I learned along the way. I hope it helps:

You Will Succeed
The number one thing to remember is that you WILL succeed if you work hard enough. You will get discouraged and instead of being depressed about it, do something about it. I worked a lot of crappy tech jobs before I finally got my foot in the door with a real IT position. That took 3 years. 

Be Humble
Don't be a cocky know it all jackass. It's the single most off putting quality in the IT world. I've seen many IT people get let go of because of this. You don't have to be a social butterfly but you have to know how to get your knowledge out there without being an ass about it. And you have to know your stuff. Don't pretend to be an expert on a subject unless you really are. 

Walk Before You Run
If you're lucky enough to get your foot in the door with a help desk position then do THAT job. Don't step on everyone's toes and start making changes outside of your own environment. If you're supposed to take phone calls and walk users through setting up their email then do THAT. Don't start logging onto switches and making changes to the network. You may think it makes you look smart to management but it has the opposite effect. Do YOUR job as best as you can. Go above and beyond in YOUR role and you will get noticed. When the time is right ask your manager about extra responsibilities and ask what you need to do in order to advance to the next stage. If they have no route for you to take then find a job that will offer you a way to succeed in your career. 

Certifications and Degrees
In my opinion, multiple choice tests don't validate your knowledge or skill. They validate that you took the time to study and had the drive to get the certification. The more respected certs are the ones that require hands on labs, i.e. Redhat certs. Cisco is good too because you have to re-certify every 3 years. It keeps you informed.
You'll hear a lot of varying opinions on this. Do you need a degree or certs? Not necessarily. But remember this; the HR/Recruiter makes two stacks of resumes. One stack has candidates with degrees and certs. The other stack goes in the trash. This may not be the case with a smaller company whereas the ""IT manager"" is also the hiring manager. In this case you might get the job but at what cost? You're going to be playing in the pee wee league and learn IT the wrong way. I've worked with a lot of people who left companies after being there for a decade. Almost all of them had the same skill set as a freshman in college. 

Freshy Fresh
Study, study, study. Don't let your skills get stale and outdated. If you have your MCSE cert from 2003, nobody cares. Don't let yourself get siloed or painted into the IT corner. Stay on top of current technologies no matter what field it is. I've learned so much by just talking to people in the IT field. Ask them what kind of set up their company is running. What software works best for them, what the environment is like, etc. Most of the time we'll chat your ear off about our environments and might even take you on a tour of the data center. Learn all you can about clusters, how they work, how they network, and you will have a great start. Stay connected, read lots of books documentation. 

Experiment
Get a bunch of old computers together and network them. Create a NFS, Hadoop cluster, Cassandra DB, MySQL DB, etc. You'll learn a lot by doing and by getting your hands dirty. Set up a lab at home. You don't even need hardware really because you can virtualize just about anything. Make it fun or you'll abandon the project early on. I'd suggest building a file server with multiple drives in a RAID config and making it possible for your other computers to talk to it to get data. Then move up another step and make your file server available to the public via ftp logins and the like. Don't forget to secure it. I guarantee you'll know more about the workings of IT after this project than 25% of people who actually work in IT. 

  

Free Open Source Software
Even if a shop is all Microsoft and enterprise software they will have some amount of FOSS. Get familiar with all the bits for Nagios, Munin, etc. Get your hands on every major FOSS you can and learn it, love it, live it. 

Programming
If you're a programmer you'll need to learn at least 3 low level languages and 3 high level languages. If you aren't a programmer then know at least one programming/scripting language. You could learn power shell but in my opinion you'd be more marketable if you know bash scripting and perl/python. It should be in every admin's toolbox. 

Resources
Other than your peers, books are great resources. The couple of books to get you started are: Unix and Linux Admin by Nemeth/Snyder, and Tubes. Read those books from front to back. I suggest Tubes because it's a well written look into the world of IT. Take breaks from the technical documentation and read Tubes. It will keep you connected to what you're doing and it's just fun to read. 

Final Thoughts
It's a lot to process through, I know. And if you don't have that love of tech you won't get far. You have to love this stuff because you're going to live it when you make it. You'll be on-call constantly. You'll have to bring work home with you. You will sacrifice many hours with your family and personal life to ensure the operation of the business. You will put the needs of a machine above the needs of yourself, friends, and family. Are you ready to make that commitment? If so, there is nothing stopping you from being successful in IT.

How do I up my chances?  ,ronoherofeb,AcademicPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/15yk4d/unsure_of_whether_to_go_masters_or_phd_route_how/,"I'm entering into my spring semester of my junior year at a state university in Connecticut. I'm going to be applying to grad schools soon, but am unsure of whether or not to go the Masters or PhD route, or which programs I would even get into.

Here's a little bit about my background
-20 years old

-junior going into spring semester

-majoring in Psychology with a concentration in the Mental Health Field

-minor in Forensics

-member of Psychology club and Psi Chi

-Have held 2 jobs a semester plus being a full time student (this has affected my GPA)

-3.56 GPA Overall

-3.8 GPA in Psychology

-1 Semester of Research in Social Psychology

-3 Semesters of Research at Yale University in their Parenting Lab (Child Research)

-An internship in a clinical setting (haven't begun yet)

-Didn't take the GRE yet

I'm not sure if I'll get into any Masters or PHD programs with these stats, as I know that they are good, but they aren't STELLAR or anything. 

Here are my goals/what I want to do in the future (I'm still relatively unsure)

-Clinical work: I want to work with clients one on one and do therapy 
-Children: I am specifically interested in child psychology, although I am also interested in adults
-Relationships (Marriage and Family)
-Forensics (Law, Court Systems)
-Possibly POSSIBLY work within the FBI, but this is just a dream

There are many great Masters Programs that I meet the criteria for/may be accepted to BUT as most of these go, they are not funded. I am interested in going for the PhD because I would like to be able to diagnose and work within the courts. In CT, you can be a therapist with a masters, and I would be able to do pretty much everything besides that.

I'm really torn. It comes down to money in the long run. I really don't want to be left with a pile of debt. How can I improve my chances of being accepted into a good program with funding?

15yawf,3,2013-01-04,I'm tired of watching my mother slowly kill herself. ,reed3790,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15yawf/im_tired_of_watching_my_mother_slowly_kill_herself/,"I am currently a graduate student at a big university, and after years of hard work, internships, and pretty much busting my ass I was able to obtain a job offer from one of the big accounting companys in a city some distance from my home town. I wanted to start over, go somewhere new and this was the chance. 

Problem is my mother has been spiraling through depression for the past 10 years, her ex husband (my dad) pretty much emotionally ruined her by losing all his money in the stock market and then passing away last year. Leaving her no choice but to pick up at 55 and find a job and take care of her self. 

She puts in no effort, rotates between cigs in the morning, alcohol mid day, weed and anti depressents at night. I am college during most of this but when I come home from break I see it first hand. She hasn't gotten a job in a year, she barely tries and is just crying and feeling bad for her all the time. Me and my brother are completely self sufficient and do not ask one dollar form her. All she needs is to pay her own way. 

Now I come home and she breaks the news to me we will have to sell our house because she can't afford to pay it. A house with no mortgage, that she can't even keep up the property taxes with, effectively she is guilt triping me to not take the job in the new city and come home and live in her bubble of sadness. Something I don't want to do.  

I cannot live with her, and need to get away from her lack of a passion for life. She has no desires to better her self, better her life, find someone else and now is bringing me down. Just because I am her son does that mean for the rest of my life I will have to support myself, my family? get out of student loan debt and support her? I am just tired of having a mother who has given up on life and wants to drag me down as much as she says she doesn't want to. 

I don't see my mom lasting 10 more years at her rate of constant drug abuse, and I am barely hanging on financially at the moment, I cannot fathom support myself and her. No idea what to do, and I feel like a terrible son if I don't step in front of a bus and sacrifice my future for her. "

EDIT 1: Removed the first story. That's 1000 words removed. Left the story that bothered me the most, made the first story pale in comparison.

The high school I went to was pretty shitty. Everyone only cared about football, which wouldn't be so bad, except that we haven't won any championships for ten years, so whenever people talked about the school football team it's always some dumb shit. I was always depressed during school. Always felt different from everyone. It was a typical high school feeling I guess. Elementary school and middle school was bullshit. I didn't speak English for the first couple years, so I was always weird. Also, I was the only Asian kid in all my classes, and being in the deep south most people are always fucking assholes to anybody different from them. Middle school was fucking bullshit. I remember getting in trouble for dumb reasons, like if two kids randomly decided to kick my ass in gym, and I would tell the teacher, and the teacher, being an arrogant fuckwad, would write both the kids AND me up, even though I was the one getting my ass kicked. Then, at the assistant principal's office, having bad communication skills at the time, I wasn't able to explain myself and got suspended anyway. And of course my dad would not be understanding and would have to rant and shit about how I'm an embarrassment and about how cousin X or cousin Y are doing so much better than me. 

Or about how this blonde asshole at my school would do the worst inhuman shit to me, like spit on me, or to the [Asian eyes](http://riogringa.typepad.com/.a/6a00e008ca9cc6883401156e357632970c-800wi) gesture at me with his group of friends. Call me names like ""Chink motherfucker"" and kick my ass whenever people aren't looking. All because of two reasons. 1.) I was Asian and 2.) I didn't know how to deal with people so the way I reacted to his bullying provided a lot of entertainment, I guess. This wouldn't be so bad, except for one thing: He was very into Asian girls. I don't know why but that still pisses me off to this day. It's so unfair. Pick on the Asian dude, call him names, dehumanize and emasculate him, but go after the Asian girls. That was super bullshit. And the girls were okay with that, too! I'm not getting any further into this because this is something I only like discussing with my counselor but...fuck middle school.

Got a little sidetracked. Back to the incident at my high school. I was pretty suicidal at the time. It got worse, since I didn't know how to express myself. I started to have outbursts in class, doing all sorts of dumb shit that you shouldn't do socially because people would judge you, whatever. It got to the point where I found out that most of the guys and girls were secretly talking shit about me, saying that I should really just kill myself. I also found out that my best friend was also involved in making fun of me. That..kind of changed me a little I guess. I started seriously considering suicide, and doing research and coming up with plans. I didn't know if I would've gone through with it or not, but... I don't know. My friend was doing shit that pissed me off at the time. He was becoming good friends with a guy who had a bunch of his friends on Facebook write shit about me on my wall. One of those popular asshole guys who thinks he's also a geek or whatever the fuck he is. 

After a bad night, I wrote a short bullshit suicide note and sent it to him via pastebin. Idk what I expected, maybe an apology? I know now that it was an asshole thing to talk about suicide to friends, since they don't know what the fuck to do about it, but..back then I was stupid and didn't understand people I guess. Anyway he replied that he got scared and called the police, which was a bit of a surprise. I thought he was joking at first, until the police came at my door. Fuck... parents. I don't know how I'm going to explain what happened... so much shit. Oh well, gotta get it off my chest.

Police... doing what they do. Gotta do their jobs, gotta respond to calls, gotta take me to the hospital, gotta make a report, gotta put it on the record, gotta make my parents cry, gotta go through all my stuff, gotta grab me if I make any sudden moves, gotta do all sorts of necessary but traumatizing shit to me and my family. They brought me to a local hospital. I still can’t remember the name of it. It was 12 in the morning. Gotta get me a blood test, my dad was there, he was disappointed in me for being such a dumb teenager. He had to get up to work in the morning, he hasn’t slept yet. He barely makes any money. The blood test cost him more than he would’ve made in a day. The staff and interns there, all judging me. I gave myself a stupid haircut a couple days ago, one of the dumb things teenagers do. I look ridiculous. I looked weak. They saw a stupid angsty Asian emo boy. They didn’t offer any sort of empathy. I didn’t deserve any. The on call counselor needed to talk to me, to get information. I was already overwhelmed, from having a bad night, from the police, from the hospital, from everything. I said I didn’t want to talk. He said okay and left for a few minutes.

THE FUCKING BASTARD came back a couple minutes later, telling me I was going to be sent to some kind of impatient teenager asylum or something. For people with mental disorders, he said. I didn’t want to deal with any of that stuff. I didn’t know what to do. I was a minor. My parents are immigrants, don’t speak English, don’t understand anything but to be disappointed in me for embarrassing them. I had final exams coming up. I had papers due. I didn’t know what to do. 

Why is he a “fucking bastard?” I’ll tell you why. I said it was a misunderstanding. I said I –didn’t want- to go to a mental asylum because I already have so much stuff to do in my life. I said a lot of things, but he’s already made his decision. “You didn’t want to talk to me,” he said. “You didn’t want to cooperate with me.”  THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. I already went through so much shit that night, if I sounded a little rude for the first 10 fucking seconds of conversation, you do not “punish” me by separating me from my goddamned friends and family, to an institution away from any fucking support I can get. He described it as a place where they would put me on medication until I would “stabilize” then, maybe after a few weeks, release me. That already sounded fucking horrible. I don’t know how, in any world, how that would be a good idea for anybody. 

My mom DID NOT FUCKING UNDERSTAND. She thought they were just sending me to a therapy place. She just said “Does he have to go? Can’t he just go every day after school? (:” A fucking ignorant question, the guy just looked at her and said “No.” and didn’t talk to my parents, because obviously they were not human fucking beings to him, that fucking asshole. I said “I want you to help me. This isn’t helping me. I need to be with my family. I don’t know what to do. Please don’t do this.” Oh well, he said. And left. Fuck him. Fuck him with all my life.

It was now 2 in the morning. My parents still need to get up, to work, to make earn back the money that the night has already cost them. Fucking world. In order not to go, they said, in order for me to not go to a place where (since I had final exams and projects and high school shit due, since I had to finish my last year in high school, since graduation was a month away) it would delay and fuck up my education, I had to wait for more “on call counselors” to come and “examine” me or some shit like that. They were on call and would have taken them hours to come to the hospital. It would’ve taken them a few hours. My parents wanted to stay with me, but I wanted them to leave. I didn’t want them to stay up all night and then go to work. Their job is already hard enough. I was left alone at the hospital. People looking at me. Probably judging me for wasting their time. Probably looking at me like I didn’t belong there, like they could’ve been helping people that actually needed help. I didn’t ask to go to that fucking hospital. I had to. The police brought me there. I had no fucking choice. I was a minor. Fuck anyone who judged me that night.

When the counselors came, I told them everything. I told them about sending that note to my friend, I told them about being depressed, I said I probably wouldn’t have done anything, I said I was just a dumb teenager who made a mistake and tried to be a person but didn’t know how. They listened. Then they decided that the decision to send me to that FUCKING MENTAL HOSPITAL was a good idea. I don’t know how, or why they thought so. Maybe because I did seem a little unstable that night. Well, anyone would be after being kept up all night, after going through a billion fucking things, after dealing with one trauma after another. Anyone would seem a little unstable and a little FUCKING WEIRD. Fuck them. So I had to go. It was already 4 or 5 in the morning. 

The ride would come to pick me up. They had to call the hospital, to tell them that I was coming, a lot of shit that would take more hours. I haven’t slept in forever. I had to stay up longer. There was a bed, but they kept the lights on. They kept the door open, they had to be always watching me. There was no way in hell I was able to fall asleep that night. I stood up to use the bathroom, the on call police officer practically tackled me, asked me where I was going. Finally letting me use the bathroom. I was in a hospital gown. I had to be in it for whatever reason. It had to be open at the end for whatever reason. I had to ride in a goddamned ambulance for whatever reason. I had to be carried on a stretcher for whatever reason.

I don’t understand hospitals. What is the point of all of this? I could walk. I could get a ride. Why did I have to ride an ambulance? Why a fucking gown? Why a fucking urine and blood test? Why charge us all this money? Why force me to do all of these things that was clearly not helping me in any way? 

It was 8am by the time I arrived at the mental hospital with the fucking name. I didn’t know what it was called. THAT PLACE WAS THE WORST. 

I can’t even begin to describe. But I have to. I fucking have to.

I called my dad. He looked up the address and got there. 9AM. He had to be at work at 11. He looked exhausted as hell. I was exhausted as hell. My hair was a mess, I looked like shit. 

This is the thing. This is where LACK OF FUCKING EMPATHY shows from the core of human nature. Lack of fucking empathy, and while I am already exhausted from writing over 3000 words, I will try to explain why. Those people…were white. My dad and I…were exhausted, lower class Asians that looked like utter fucking shit. They did not have any context of what we had to go through that night. They handed us the typical waiting room forms to fill out. The forms had questions that my dad and I didn’t know how to answer. Questions about my mental health. Questions like “Has your child talked about hearing voices at night? Has your child ever lost control of his or her limbs? Have you ever feared your child?” Shit like that. They gave me a fucking APPLE STICKER to wear on my shirt, god damn them! My dad didn’t know how to answer most of the questions, most of them were subjective, scaled questions. My dad didn’t know how to fill out most of the form. And because of that, the lady at the desk treated us like shit. Every time we walked up for help, or to turn in a form, she just gave us a shitty look, like we were shit human beings. The FUCKING lady even started to make comments, in front of us, like “Wow, here we go again.” “Why am I not surprised that you people didn’t complete this form again?” Shit comments like that. To my father. 

Another terrible thing is that my dad wasn’t allowed to leave. I wasn’t allowed to sleep. Until the “head psychologist” examined me. By now it is 10am. My dad has to be in work in an hour. He has SAID THIS TO THE LADY MANY TIMES. The lady just looked at him and told him to wait! Now pay attention, this is where most of the bullshit has accumulated. This is the moment where I decided to fuck life.  After several times of my dad telling them that he NEEDED to leave for work, or else, you know, he’ll lose his house and my family will lose our house, they told him again to wait. My dad asked how long, and the lady said this, “He will be here in about 4 hours.” BULLSHIT. DID YOU NOT LISTEN TO US? ARE WE NOT FUCKING HUMAN BEINGS TO YOU? Talking to my dad condescendingly, trolling us like this, without empathy, after what happened, Just because we look different from you. Just because we don’t speak with the SHIT EATING SOUTHERN ACCENT that you have. FUCK YOU. 

My dad and I left. We weren’t allowed to leave, but we did anyway. My dad raged at them as we left, in broken English. The racist thoughts that must have been in their heads while this has happened, I don’t know.

We left, and I finally got to sleep. My dad had to go to work. I felt numb as fuck. Mentally. I felt dead inside. I knew they would come for me. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t think. I just needed sleep. 

At 4pm my dad is at work, my mom called in sick, and I heard voices outside. I knew it was them. I didn’t know what to do. I went outside, and guess who they sent? Guess who the good people of my city sent to convince my family to let me be institutionalized? 
A Korean social worker. HAHAHA. From what he told my family, what happened was this. The mental hospital called the police, telling them my father couldn’t understand what was going on. They suggested that maybe it was our culture that made us unwilling to accept this treatment. Do you understand now? It’s not because of the COMPLETE BULLSHIT we went through that night as to why we didn’t want to do this, it’s because we were not white!

Anyway, that’s all I have to say about that. In the end my mom had to sign a fucking form saying she was liable if I kill myself. Basically the city saying “Fuck you, do what you want, you fucking chinks.” 

Bullshit. I wrote about this, told my school counselor about this, and still they say, “Your [fucking asshole] friend did the right thing. He’s a good person.” Fuck them. Fuck all of them to hell. They didn’t hear a thing of what I’ve said. He’s the hero, isn’t he?  

This is why I’m mad. Lack of empathy. People just can’t empathize with things that they can’t empathize well with. This is a huge problem. Let me try to explain. Let’s say you’re an average redditor. I am almost like you. You are most likely a liberal, college age, a student. You are also probably white. This isn’t a bad thing, but lets examine what happens with empathy here. What is your reaction when you hear about a shooting made by a white student? It’s a terrible thing, but we’re probably able to empathize well with that student. We’re probably more likely to think about what drove him to this, whether he was bullied, whether he came from a bad family. If we have ever been angry at society (I know I have) we probably would have even empathized well with him, and not hate him as much for what he’s done.

Now lets make the shooter black. Or Korean. NOW WHAT???? This is the problem of human empathy. We just can’t empathize well with types of people that AREN’T US. How well can Reddit empathize with African Americans? With Asian Americans? With feminists? With republicans? With conservatives? Do we dehumanize them, do we joke about them without GIVING A FUCKING SHIT when some of them speak up and say “I’m offended by this.” Because it’s just a joke. Why are they taking the fun away? Why are they being like this? Those are questions asked when empathy fails. That’s the reason for my title. I don’t shit if you’re black and you donate a fuckton of money to a black cause, or if you’re gay and donated a fuckton of money to It Gets Better. I don’t give a shit. It doesn’t make you special that you EMPTAHIZE WELL WITH PEOPLE SIMILAR TO YOU. It’s a good thing, I admit, but it doesn’t make you a good fucking person if you empathize well with people similar to you but fail completely when it comes to people different from you.

I’m tired as hell. I’m going to pass out now. But if anyone made it this far thank you. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention one more thing that pissed me off. A few weeks later, the hospital sent my family the bill for the ambulance ride. It was like $4000 or something. Fuck them. They just wanted our money. This system sucks. Going to bed now. Goodnight

15xyh3,6,2013-01-04,Wonderful Australian law student (my sister) looking for a place to stay in or near the city for her 6 month internship.,panserbean,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/15xyh3/wonderful_australian_law_student_my_sister/,"Hey guys,
My sister is currently in Washington DC but is living in a share house. Apparently everyone there is pretty insane apart from one cool dude who is leaving this Saturday. I was wondering if any of you guys knew of or had a room available, or could advise me where to look. We are Australian but live in Paris, and I'm terrified she'll get hurt by some crazy all the way across the ocean and need to do something! HELP!

THank you so much!!

Edit:
More info on my sister: She is a really healthy eating, hard working law student who speaks fluent French, English, Spanish and German. She's tidy and sociable but needs her own space. Doesn't mind pets unless the pet owner is unclean etc. but that's everyone I assume... ( I have a cat and dog and she has resided with both and loves them). Doesn't smoke really (occasional but never indoors and doesn't need to). Probably one of the most kind hearted and generous people you will ever meet. What's more she has amazing knowledge of French/American/World politics, culture and history and it's awesome to just pick her brains. Sorry I'm going on and on and I know she's my sister and all but she really is an amazing person and has been a joy to live with. Neither of us know was Washington dc but her internship is at the FTC so right in the city and she says she'd like to walk to work if poss... Apparently the transport over there is mad expensive. Speaking of which, she's a poor student so can't afford much over 1000 dollars a month I don't think...."
15xyag,19,2013-01-04,Investing Money I Make From Going to College,justgivingsomeadvice,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/15xyag/investing_money_i_make_from_going_to_college/,"Hey finance-savvy redditors,

I have a question that probably isn't too common on this sub. I'm only 18 (well 19 in less than 3 weeks) and in my first year at college right now. The catch is that I'm going on a full scholarship, where I actually receive money for attending this university. It's supposed to be ~$600/quarter (so about $2K/year), but because my middle class parents are willing to cover expenses like books and other misc. fares that some of the money is supposed to go to, I'm getting closer to $2K/quarter (or $6K/year). I'm not necessarily frugal, but I don't like spending money needlessly, so most of it just goes in my bank account. I had about $2000 before this year, but my first check put me at about $4300. I'm majoring in computer science by the way, in case that's relevant.

So my question is, what should I be doing with this money? My dad wants me to start my Roth IRA or something, which I know is a (safe?) retirement fund. Is that the only thing I should look into? How much should I be investing? I've talked to some of the scholarship's ""society"" and they basically expect that we get internships (paid preferably), so in 2013, I should be making more than the $6000 from my scholarship. (Obviously I don't know what quality internship so I can't put a figure.)

Any guidance would be great."

EDIT 1: Removed the first story. That's 1000 words removed. Left the story that bothered me the most, made the first story pale in comparison.

The high school I went to was pretty shitty. Everyone only cared about football, which wouldn't be so bad, except that we haven't won any championships for ten years, so whenever people talked about the school football team it's always some dumb shit. I was always depressed during school. Always felt different from everyone. It was a typical high school feeling I guess. Elementary school and middle school was bullshit. I didn't speak English for the first couple years, so I was always weird. Also, I was the only Asian kid in all my classes, and being in the deep south most people are always fucking assholes to anybody different from them. Middle school was fucking bullshit. I remember getting in trouble for dumb reasons, like if two kids randomly decided to kick my ass in gym, and I would tell the teacher, and the teacher, being an arrogant fuckwad, would write both the kids AND me up, even though I was the one getting my ass kicked. Then, at the assistant principal's office, having bad communication skills at the time, I wasn't able to explain myself and got suspended anyway. And of course my dad would not be understanding and would have to rant and shit about how I'm an embarrassment and about how cousin X or cousin Y are doing so much better than me. 

Or about how this blonde asshole at my school would do the worst inhuman shit to me, like spit on me, or to the [Asian eyes](http://riogringa.typepad.com/.a/6a00e008ca9cc6883401156e357632970c-800wi) gesture at me with his group of friends. Call me names like ""Chink motherfucker"" and kick my ass whenever people aren't looking. All because of two reasons. 1.) I was Asian and 2.) I didn't know how to deal with people so the way I reacted to his bullying provided a lot of entertainment, I guess. This wouldn't be so bad, except for one thing: He was very into Asian girls. I don't know why but that still pisses me off to this day. It's so unfair. Pick on the Asian dude, call him names, dehumanize and emasculate him, but go after the Asian girls.

A Korean social worker. HAHAHA. From what he told my family, what happened was this. The mental hospital called the police, telling them my father couldn’t understand what was going on. They suggested that maybe it was our culture that made us unwilling to accept this treatment. Do you understand now? It’s not because of the COMPLETE BULLSHIT we went through that night as to why we didn’t want to do this, it’s because we were not white!

Anyway, that’s all I have to say about that. In the end my mom had to sign a fucking form saying she was liable if I kill myself. Basically the city saying “Fuck you, do what you want, you fucking chinks.” 

Bullshit. I wrote about this, told my school counselor about this, and still they say, “Your [fucking asshole] friend did the right thing. He’s a good person.” Fuck them. Fuck all of them to hell. They didn’t hear a thing of what I’ve said. He’s the hero, isn’t he?  
This is why I’m mad. Lack of empathy. People just can’t empathize with things that they can’t empathize well with. This is a huge problem. Let me try to explain. Let’s say you’re an average redditor. I am almost like you. You are most likely a liberal, college age, a student. You are also probably white. This isn’t a bad thing, but lets examine what happens with empathy here. What is your reaction when you hear about a shooting made by a white student? It’s a terrible thing, but we’re probably able to empathize well with that student. We’re probably more likely to think about what drove him to this, whether he was bullied, whether he came from a bad family. If we have ever been angry at society (I know I have) we probably would have even empathized well with him, and not hate him as much for what he’s done.

Now lets make the shooter black. Or Korean. NOW WHAT???? This is the problem of human empathy. We just can’t empathize well with types of people that AREN’T US. How well can Reddit empathize with African Americans? With Asian Americans? With feminists? With republicans? With conservatives? Do we dehumanize them, do we joke about them without GIVING A FUCKING SHIT when some of them speak up and say “I’m offended by this.” Because it’s just a joke. Why are they taking the fun away? Why are they being like this? Those are questions asked when empathy fails. That’s the reason for my title. I don’t shit if you’re black and you donate a fuckton of money to a black cause, or if you’re gay and donated a fuckton of money to It Gets Better. I don’t give a shit. It doesn’t make you special that you EMPTAHIZE WELL WITH PEOPLE SIMILAR TO YOU. It’s a good thing, I admit, but it doesn’t make you a good fucking person if you empathize well with people similar to you but fail completely when it comes to people different from you.

I’m tired as hell. I’m going to pass out now. But if anyone made it this far thank you.

Look, ever since I got to college, I've fallen out of shape and essentially regressed mentally.  I've recently gotten off of pot and excessive drinking, but I don't feel the way I used to.

I miss being me.

Allow me to vent briefly:

I live with a bunch of assholes...  they're my friends and fraternity brothers, but they're usually the reason I can't get enough sleep.  Their weeknight music keeps me up til fucking 3 in the morning.  When I confront them, they act offended because I'm interfering with their partying, claiming it's the ""way of the house"".  And there's no other available housing on campus.

I want to get back to my prime.  In high school, I'd get up on my own accord, at 5 in the god damn morning to go running before school started.  I'd volunteer because it made me happy.  I felt grounded in spirit, and I was content with life.  I was a 4.0 student coming in with 35 credits.

3 years later, I'm a 2.97 student with nothing to brag about but my fraternity membership and a summer internship that was essentially given to me.

But I'm going to bring things back to the way they were 3 years ago.  It's gonna happen again this semester.  I've already made some basic adjustments by deleting my facebook and electing to go inactive in my fraternity.

I have projects too!  I spent the savings I would have spent on dues on a 5 level Rosetta Stone Chinese set, which I plan to use daily.  I'm also working on an iPhone app with some friends from high school.

I have the best girlfriend and family a guy can ask for (I swear I'm not whipped).  I know I'm mentally capable.  I have all the pieces, just with this tricky housing hurdle to jump over.

My main problem is, I like to party, and sometimes I'll allow the short term gratification of that to get in the way of my long term goals.

Please, can someone help me with some advice, some insight, anything?  I'm just a college bum trying to find my way again.  Help me get into shape, help me get a 4.0...  Help high school Rob get back on his feet!

You guys are the best - I've been passively reading this subreddit for months and this is my first post.  If you've been kind enough to read this far, THANK YOU, and please leave a helpful comment or upvote. I promise, if I get through this semester and come out a stronger version of the guy I used to be, I'll write an inspirational follow-up post... hopefully it'll be good.

I'm a junior in high school who is looking into to IT career path. Recently, I've assisted/am assisting our tech guy with installing two computer labs and general computer maintenance around our school. 

I've also talked to him some about next year, dedicating half of my school day to working with him as an unpaid intern. I would be doing what he does, just helping I suppose. I don't believe I would get a credit because of his lack of a teaching license. 

My big question is though, is any of this beneficial to me for a job resume? Or is this just something they'll not care about?

15xub9,11,2013-01-04,"""Give me back my entry key and get out.” The story of how all my dreams died one day.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15xub9/give_me_back_my_entry_key_and_get_out_the_story/,"Something happened to me a while back that I have been wanting to get off my chest for some time now. It’s a bit of a long read, so I’ll understand if you want to quit now. Here goes:

Some background: I’m a 22 year old, African-American female. I’m one of those people who entered college straight out of high school, attended for a year, and dropped out when I couldn't afford it anymore. During that year, I accrued about $10k in student loan debt.

Anyway, fast forward a bit, after I left college I started working at a Mexican restaurant, a Starbucks, and a Noodles &amp; Company simultaneously. They were all minimum wage jobs: $8 an hour at Starbucks, $9 at Noodles, and tips (about 100-300 per week) at the Mexican place. So after bills (rent, phone, gas, student loans, etc) I was living off of like $200 a month. It really wasn't that bad, but I felt like I needed to better myself. I had a shit ton of customer service experience since I had been working since age 15 and I had a year of college under my belt, I felt like I could get into some entry-level position and work my way up.

So after 2 years of working 3 jobs and sending my resume out like mad, I finally got a call that changed everything. A local insurance agency wanted to interview me for a customer service representative position. Apparently one of the women who had been working there for almost 10 years was leaving to spend more time with her child and they needed a replacement.

I went in with low self-esteem and even lower expectations, but lo and behold, the owner of the agency called me and told me I was hired! I immediately put in my two weeks at my other jobs and I was ready to put all that behind me. I never thought I was going to be anything other than a minimum wage-slave with a petty misdemeanor on my record and no real education or skills, but I finally felt like I was moving up in the world.

When I went into my new job the next day, my spirits were through the roof. This was the break I had been waiting for. They wanted to pay me $38,500 annually. That may seem low to some, but it was more money than I’d ever thought I’d be making. My first thought was that I was finally going to be able to afford to eat meat again lol.

Fast forward a bit- After a week, I began to notice some changes in the office. The lady I had been hired to replace actually came back and took her old job (my new job) back. They reassured me that they still needed me because one woman who had been there for 15 years left temporarily because her blood pressure was incredibly high from stress. One man got hired for a week and was fired over the weekend.

Some other things… I noticed that my boss, the owner, made me clean the entire office from top to bottom, take out all the trash, wash the windows, and shred all the paper in the office (we were about 70% paper, 30% online). After work, the other new girl and I joked that I was the highest paid janitor in the world. I thought it was odd that the other new girl didn’t have to do any of the “bitch work” that I had to do like cleaning and filing the mountains of back paper work in the office, but I didn’t care. I was so happy to finally have a break in life.

Fast forward again- 2 weeks later, my boss (who had been so sweet to me when I was hired) was cold and withdrawn. I noticed that someone was rummaging through my desk when I was out to lunch (this was confirmed by the other new girl during our after work chats). During work, I noticed the other women watching me and it seemed like they were waiting for me to mess up so they could go into our bosses office and tell on me. It was so unpleasant. They would tell him something that I did, made up or real, then they would come out with smug smiles on their faces. Then he would call me into his office and tear into me and curse at me and slam his hands on the desk until I cried and ran for the bathroom. At this point- 3 weeks into my employment- I still hadn't been trained to sell insurance (even thought one of my duties was to take every phone call and troubleshoot insurance issues) and I was still doing bitch work that no one else in the office (including the other new girl) had to do. There were 5 other people in the office, including an intern (who would often go to lunch and bring back food for everyone but me and the other new girl). They were all white. The guy I mentioned earlier who was hired for a week and fired over the weekend was mixed Black and Spanish. I tried to ignore all of these things because I had gotten two paychecks already and I wanted more. I had a plan, I was going to finish school and finally become an adult. 

Eventually I started getting called into the boss’s office for ridiculous things: My desk was too bare so it looked like I didn’t want to stay there, the teddy bear holding a heart I put on my desk that I got from when I had heart surgery was immature- but the teddy bears everyone else had on their desks was ok because they were from their children, I wasn't working fast enough, I was working too fast and making too many mistakes, I was being bossy, I wasn't being assertive enough, I was being too friendly by laughing at customers jokes, I was saying the word “yeah” too much.

One day, on the day that I had finished all the back filing, I saw both of the senior employees go into the boss’s office, come out with those smug smiles on their faces, and go into what I referred to as “the whisper corner” because they would whisper and giggle there and we (the new girl and I) always knew it was about one of us. Boss called me into his office at  the end of the day and said, “Anon, I don’t want you to work here anymore. You've been employed here for a full month now and you make too many mistakes. We all dress the same here, talk the same, and act the same here and you just don’t fit in. Give me back my entry key and get out.” I’ll never forget how he stood behind me and watched me clean out my desk, the way he smiled smugly as he watched me sob.

Fast forward- It took me 2 months to get a new job. It was at a restaurant. Unfortunately, without two more minimum wage jobs to back it up, it was not enough. My car broke down (I lived in a suburb with no public transportation whatsoever) and my bills piled up. The managers at the new restaurant noticed that my uniform was often disheveled and they admonished me for not taking the time to clean it every night. I was too proud to admit that I couldn't afford laundry detergent until they paid me and that I was living off of the free training meals they gave me each night. They told me that they didn't think I was fitting in. I saved them the trouble of firing me and I just quit. I briefly considered suicide. I tried a synthetic form of heroin called Suboxone that an ex coworker offered me because he said that was how he coped with it all (a degrading job, being a minimum wage jockey who barely survives). My boyfriend told me that I should stop thinking about killing myself, cut the drug crap out, and move in with my mother. He saved my life. But sometimes I still wonder if things would be better if I had just ended it all then and there.

So I packed up, left my best friend, my boyfriend, my home of 22 years behind, and moved from the East Coast to the Midwest where my mother lives. By the way, I had been (legally) on my own since I was 18, so it felt like I was crawling back to mommy with white flag waving.

Now I live in her spare room. I know I’m a burden to her. She left the East coast and built her own life in the Midwest- everyday I feel like I’m messing that up for her. Everyday, I apply for jobs. Everynight I stay up drinking. I can’t sleep at night unless I drink because when I close my eyes, I see that wealthy, well-dressed man smirking and laughing at me while I empty out my desk of all the hopes and dreams I had.

**Tl;Dr- Lost job, considered suicide, moved to the Midwest, suffering from (undiagnosed) ptsd and depression, life sucks maybe permanently.**

And that’s my story. I guess I really just needed to get that off my chest.

**ETA: I kept in touch with the other new girl from the agency. She said that after I was fired, they split up the ""bitch work"" equally between all of them at first, then piled it all on her so she quit and hit the bottle pretty hard.** Also, some spelling and grammar.

15xrwr,0,2013-01-04,Would like some advice on my next watch purchase [Bulova 63C010 Chrono],mustachianado,Watches,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/15xrwr/would_like_some_advice_on_my_next_watch_purchase/,"I've been looking to purchase a new watch for a while now, but have decided to wait to save for a ~$500 - $1000 watch. (Kind of a self gift for after my internship).

Anyways, after looking at many Citizens, Tissots and the like, I stumbled across this Bulova Accutron:
http://www.amazon.com/Bulova-63C010-Watch-Chronograph-Round/dp/B003S0E8GG

I find it to be quite gorgeous, and right in my price range. I think [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vy4ZrkzWDc) video shows off its looks a little better. However, I've never owned a Bulova, and don't know how well received they are around here.

Does anyone have this or a similar Bulova, or have advice in general when purchasing Bulova's or similar watches? This is quite a bit of money to spend on a watch (for me anyways), so I want to make sure I get one that is definitely worth the price tag. 

Also, if you have any suggestions for other good watches in this price range, please let me know.

I'd definitely appreciate any insight, Thanks!"
15xrv7,3,2013-01-04,I want to fulfill a dream but life may be getting in the way.,peper224,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15xrv7/i_want_to_fulfill_a_dream_but_life_may_be_getting/,"This is not as serious as a large amount of posts on this subreddit but every friend I turn to gives me the same ""I don't know dude..."" answer and its driving me insane. 

I recently found a program that would allow me to intern abroad for two months this upcoming summer. I would be placed in an apartment in London with fellow students and would be placed in a company in my selected field. I have always wanted to visit London and even thought about moving there after I graduated. This seems like a once in a life time opportunity since I'm in my third year of school and by next summer I will be applying for actual jobs. 

However, there are a bunch of things standing in my way. The first is the cost. Its over $8,000 for literally two months of unpaid interning. My family isn't in any bad spots financially but they wouldn't be able to assit me in this if I chose to take advantage. That being said, I would probably have to take a loan out for this amount (which freaks me out because I've managed to avoid school loans for this long by working so much). And since I would be away, I would have to leave my current job and not be able to save for next year's tuition meaning more loans to pick up. 
Money aside, I also need to find a place to live during my final year and my current plan would be to sign into a lease with a few friends during May and hold that lease for a year. If I go I would either have to sign the lease and assit paying rent for somewhere I don't live or leave my friends to cover my part of the rent. I'm afraid if I follow through I wouldn't have a place to live and would have to move home or pay more for housing. 
I would love to be able to have a life long memory and being able to say I worked somewhere I dreamt but the 'cons' of this seem to stack up against me. That being said, what does the Reddit community think? You all are pretty much an unbiased point of view so I would love to hear from you all. Thanks for reading and helping me deal with my first world problem.

Thanks,

&gt;Hey Dr. [department chair],
&gt;
&gt;The reason I am sending you a message is because I currently work for an IT Consultant Firm called [company] in Midtown Manhattan.  We are currently looking for some interns to help us out with a project in mid January. 
&gt;
&gt;The intern would generally work in the Midtown Manhattan area going to several clients in the area maintaining Networks and PC's.  However, the major project we need help with is for an office in Connecticut for one of our major clients (they 're major office is in NYC).  We will be moving several servers, setting up the network, setting up new PC's, pulling Cat5 Cable, and so much more.  We feel that this is a great opportunity for a university student majoring in Information Science.
&gt;
&gt;We will follow the school requirements for the intern or if they simply want to get the experience as well as a recommendation from my boss.  This is a non-paid internship, but we will be paying for all transportation, including transportation to Connecticut and any necessary subway rides when going to different clients.
&gt;
&gt;Do you think you can forward this to university students majoring in Information Science?  Let me know if you need any more information.  Please tell them to email me here at if they are interested.

And 99% of the time it's people from IT consulting firms with Indian names. So, bullshit or legit?   

 I completed an internship last summer at a pharmaceutical company in their information systems department. Their system admin for the company's LMS basically taught me as much as should she could about her job and I learned a lot, got paid 14.50 an hour, had a company iphone, laptop, and my own desk/cubicle. I learned about toad, crystal reports, and databases. The ""internship"" quoted above sounds like unpaid grunt work. Maybe I'm overreacting and this happens at every school, I don't know...


EDIT: I did some digging and it's a recent graduate from the info science program. I'm thinking he is probably doing what his boss told him to do. If it were me in his shoes I would not to forward this bogus position to former students. Name redacted because I feel bad."
15xolx,3,2013-01-04,This is what a mess I am,another30yovirgin,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/15xolx/this_is_what_a_mess_i_am/,"Woman 1: I met her through one of my best friends' girlfriends. We both went to a party together over the summer and then quite a bit later in the fall. She was cute, sweet, and she seemed to remember me even though the second time was a lot later than the first. She seemed to enjoy conversing with me. She sort of lives far away. The thing is, I worry that if I were to make a move, anything that happened with her would get back to my friend, and that would be awkward. Also, my friend knows her pretty well, and not being a disastrous touch freak (as I am), is much more comfortable being physically touchy with her. It always makes me feel a little weird.

Woman 2: This is one of my coworkers. She's cute and we have a lot in common. She has noted a few tastes that I don't share, but still. She seems to like being around me. She seems to insist on sharing my office space, although she could go elsewhere. The last day she was in town before going on holiday, she seemed to want to go to lunch with me. I am worried about asking out a coworker, though, given past experiences.

Woman 3: I met this one at a volunteer activity that we both do. We had seen each other many times, but only met recently when we were having a thank you for the volunteers. She and I talked almost the whole time and then ended up catching the bus together afterwards. I'll see her again in a couple weeks when the project starts going again. She was thinking about switching days, but I may have talked her out of it.

Woman 4: I went to a going away party for a friend a couple weeks ago and chatted with someone one who had tagged along with a mutual friend of the guy who was going away. It turns out that she did the same internship I did a year later. I had more or less forgotten about her, but suddenly she adds me as a connection on LinkedIn. Keep in mind, it has been a couple weeks since I saw her. She's not as cute as some of the others, but definitely worth dating.

Woman 5: I went to school with this one, and she seemed interested in me then. Or at least I thought she might be. She asked if I wanted to go to coffee once (which felt like a social thing, but what do I know?). So then she moved to another country, so I imagined her being out of the picture. Apparently she's back, though, and she wrote to me to try and meet again. She's really cute, but she's from a different culture and I don't really know how to read her.

Woman 6: I was at a New Year's party the other day. There were a lot of guys and not too many women. Of the four women there, 3 of them were there with men. This one was alone. Many of the single men there were good at dancing. This girl picks me to dance, even though I'm not a dancer at all. Then, she insists that we must dance *close*, because that's how it's supposed to be, and it will be easier that way. I'm not sure she's my type, but she was cute.

Woman 7: I met this one at work (a different job) over the summer. I fell for her in a big way. Finally, I managed to get up the courage to ask her out. She said she just wanted to be friends. Then she broke off contact with me. I was pretty heartbroken. I still miss her. I think about her every day, even though when I originally met her, I saw some pretty clear red flags. I brushed them off, because I don't want to get married to the first woman I kiss, and I could see myself breaking up with her.

I'd be happy to date any of these women, and chances are at least one of them wants to date me. Most likely, though, I'll have forgotten about all but #7 by the end of the year. That last one will probably make me sad for the rest of my life."

I never had time to go to any of my school's resume advice things or anything like that. I recently graduated in May but took a night baking job because they had the earliest start day and me and my dad where close to hitting the streets. I quit after 7 months working nights but on good terms. I have good references everywhere I go who will really go to bat for me concerning what a hard worked I am.

I can't work with food anymore - I just can't mentally deal with that shit. I recently got a degree, decent grades, and a diploma both related to law enforcement. A lot of positions I apply for I need to try and stress the social services aspect of my degree.

I'm concerned about the following:

Chronological orders vs. relevance in work history (my co-op placements are my most relevant admin experience)

Formatting errors

For the love of god tell me if I messed up and put identifiable information on this - my field is unforgiving in terms of anonymity

Anything that looks bad, be brutal please

Should I pay for a professional resume?

----

I hope to gain some administration experience or find a job that can give me around 30k with regular working hours and an occasional long-weekend. I want to turn this into a position as a court clerk or government job later on (I'm already applying for these now but more experience would help). I've thought of doing unpaid internships for experience but we can't afford it at the moment.

----------

I apply for a lot of government positions and clerical/receptionist positions at local law firms. I also apply for positions asking for an administrative assistant. I've been at it for a week with no interviews. I worked full-time through the course of my degree but have left several employers off my resume (hospitality can be brutal and some places I quit in under 2 months). 

--------

I'll be very grateful for any really insightful feedback. If you can blow my mind with something I'll give you reddit gold. Basically I'm on the verge of having to go back to working in hospitality because of lack of other options and it turns me into a severely depressed asshole.

I was really excited about the specific program from my university (mathematics and Econ) and the new degree would be econ only.

I was planning on spending this year barley getting by with my family hoping to take a few internships and with a Dec graduation land a job more like I'd want next year. 

I guess what I'm stuck on is ""am I a GS-worker person?""  I've heard so many bad stereotypes about the people that work GS jobs, and think between my school and experience i have a chance to crack some really nice jobs in another 12 months. BUT, having healthcare and a steady paycheck for my family now would be nice. And I kind of like the idea that GS workers have more time to be people outside of work. That they can be coaches and PTA members and cub parents and such instead of just working all the time.

But, I kind of really like working...

[Any chance I could hit a gusher whilst drilling your well-oiled oil well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qbg5q?context=5)|Downvote... haha.
 |On second read i kind of think thats funny. at least you're clever about it instead of insultingly vulgar haha. 
[How do you become an oil rig worker? whats your salary? what are your work hours? do guys hit on you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qbdpr?context=5)|There are a lot of different ways to become an oil rig worker... I studied chemical engineering in college and decided to get to the oil business. This job is the ""grunt work"" type entry level position for a bigger role in the company. BUT you don't need a college degree to get a job on a oil rig... as long as you have an incredible work ethic and are willing to get dirty.
 |Salary is $60k. However you get bonuses for days spent on the rig which over the course of the year will likely be 6 figures.
 |At first, all males just ignore me. As a woman on the rig I'm just this foreigner in their environment that they don't know what to do with. They're afraid I'll be offended if they swear in front of me or that I'll report them for something. After awhile everyone starts to accept that I'm just another person out there trying to do my job and people become a little more friendly... but I've never been put in a situation where I felt like it was more then just friendly banter.
[I would be interested in this! Do you like your job? I am a girl engineer who tends to get boy oriented jobs.. lol. I am always looking for a new adventure, would you suggest this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qfp99?context=5)|Not in North Dakota... worked up there for a little and don't ever want to go back. So cold!!!
[Ps. If you are in North Dakota.. not sure what city.. I know a very attractive guy that works in an oil field. lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qfp99?context=5)|I like my job for the opportunities it provides me. It isn't what I ever thought I'd be doing, and definitely not what I want to do forever. But I like it enough to do it for now. It is a great opportunity :)
[NMIMT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qdr04?context=5)|Don't know what that is. But guessing won't help you because I'm not going to tell you anyways haha. 
[Socorro. I'm guessing with the 505 attached that you're northern NM. that's the best guess i had, though i guess other well-known universities in the area probably offer your program as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qdtzs?context=5)|The 505 is because I really like 505 salsa. Best salsa in the world. And the green chili kills. As in awesome.
[Well anyone guessing a school other than Texas A&amp;M is not making a very informed guess anyway. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qfxyj?context=5)|Not true considering I said lower down I went to school in the east :) muahahahaa. 
[There's a really good brand of salsa that they make in NYC.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qevkk?context=5)|Really good isn't the best :) hahaha. 
[Do you ever fantasize about a ragtag team of your co-workers and Bruce Willis being called up to NASA for a mission to save the world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qbul7?context=5)|Haha I hadn't before but now I will. 
[How often do you party with the roughnecks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qbkdf?context=5)|Honestly? NEVER. The last thing a woman on an oil field needs is any kind of reputation. I try hard to avoid anything that could construed in a negative way. People talk and if you're the only female engineer in the area people will know things about you. So I try stay incredibly professional at work. 
[How often do you get chatted up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qbf6w?context=5)|Not often. If I do, it's usually by a truck driver or someone who isn't permanently on the rig. Most men on the rig just ignore me because my presence is confusing and different. They don't want me to file any report on them so they keep their distance. Then if I'm around for long enough I just become another worker out there. 
[Is the rig not offshore?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qd2pa?context=5)|I work on land rigs. 
[Oh. So you don't live in some kind of dorm with the other workers then? That would be interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qdh99?context=5)|On land rigs, the drilling company provides trailers for the people working out there. Usually there isn't enough room to give a woman their own room, let alone their own trailer (which would make me stand out even more if I took an entire trailer to myself). So I live in the same trailer as the other employees for my company out here working, and maybe a few others. I get my own room for the 12 hours I am off, but in the other 12 hours the room belongs to the others staying in there. I share a bathroom with them also.
[What kind of work do they have you doing with a degree? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qdh99?context=5)|For the kind of work I'm going to refer you to one of the other posts I haven't responded too yet... but i'm going to respond there so it's not so far down the chain :). 
[Holy crap, they have you 'hot bunking' with someone? Do you get your own sheets or what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qiftb?context=5)|I definitely bring my own haha. Also each person has their own bed in that room... just not their own room. So I don't have to change them out or anything.
[What makes said information ""confidential?"" Is that dealing with the work or the engineering behind the rig itself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qbfz7?context=5)|I can tell you who and where we are working, but I can't tell you specific procedures or divulge anything about the data we are garnering for the client. Also anything to do with the technology of the tools or programs I work with is private company information.
[Who is the company and where are you working?  Also, please be sure not to do anything that would get you fired.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qc9pn?context=5)|Thanks for the concern! If we met in person I would give you more specifics but on the internet I'll just say I work for an oilfield services company like Baker Hughes, Halliburton and Schlumberger. Currently drilling in South Texas slightly north of the Mexican border.  
[I am going to high school for that now, just got a 96/110 on my lastest well technology test today.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qco7r?context=5)|Awesome! Congrats for getting a sweet start in life. Biggest advice: save up your money and don't start off making huge purchases :). Just my two cents.
[Going out to the Norwegian sea after summer:\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qco7r?context=5)|I'm not going to lie to you it can be incredibly draining. But for every rough day there's a relaxed day. Some days the 12 hours goes by really fast but nothing is going right so it's really painful. Some days the 12 hours crawls because you're so tired and all you want to do is sleep. But then some days you get to post on reddit all day and you literally have nothing to do :). Some people watch TV shows and movies to pass the time when it's boring. I choose to read mostly.
[So I am just wondering, is there much waiting between stuff to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qco7r?context=5)|And you find your outlet. I drive to town and go to the gym to run after work and that keeps me sane. That's probably not an option offshore necessarily, but there's always something.
[Also, what is it like to work 12 hours each day? I mean, I can get tiered after 8 hours of school, so was just wondering if it's hard or if you adapt to it:\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qco7r?context=5)|This job is a fantastic opportunity. It just takes time to adjust. Good luck!!!
[I assumed you too were offshore since you said ""oil rig"" I though of the offshore ones.  Also, I saw a show not long ago, ""black gold"" bunch of stupid jocks, is it anything like that where you work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qen78?context=5)|Bahhahaaa. That show is ridiculous. I can't handle it. The things you see in the background (equipment etc...) is similar. The people couldn't be different. Everything they do in that show is prohibited and incredibly unsafe. If those people came out here they would get fired in the first second. 
[I work for a big drilling/downhole solutions company in the US as part of IT and often deal with a lot of the oil rig workers that are having issues with computers while on rigs...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qcrep?context=5)|The travelling is not great. I drive myself to the rig and where I work now is about 6 hours from my apartment. 
[How does it feel to basically be on dialup when you are out on a lot of the rigs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qcrep?context=5)|We set up our own internet by pointing a satellite. While it's not great, I am thankful that we have it. The worst thing is when it's raining or a really cloudy day and the speed decreases so much that you can hardly load any pages.
[What is the furthest offshore that you've been on a rig or do you mostly stay in-land?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qcrep?context=5)|I have never been offshore, I have only worked on land rigs.
[You still keep an apartment? Would it not make more sense to get yourself a decent motorhome? If you were doing off-shore work maybe an apartment would be necessary. Maybe. But onshore???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qeuen?context=5)|Hmmm I'm not sure what you mean by company dormatories. I assume you meant while on the job? Those would be provided whether or not I stay there. If you meant that those would be in town, we don't have any of those, therefore not an option.
[You might even be able to get a living ""allowance"" for not using the company dormitories. Combine that with not paying rent, and you could easily afford the payments on a GOOD motorhome. No?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qeuen?context=5)|I work 6 hours from where I live. If I didn't have an apartment I would not have a place to sleep on my days off. I would have to stay in a hotel or on friends couches. Driving a motor home would be terrible, also I like to have a semblance of a ""normal life"" with real furniture, a decent kitchen, and neighbors. In all honesty I live life on the go so much that I want to have a real home to come back too! 
[Would you consider yourself a physically ""strong"" woman? I am female and can't do a pushup (ha\) and when I imagine working on an oil rig I always assumed lots of physical strength is involved. Is that true or is that a misconception? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qcoac?context=5)|I am not strong. I like to consider myself athletic but when it comes to upper body strength I have none. Tried to use my roommates pull up bar the other day and I maybe lifted myself an inch haha.
 |The answer is both yes and no. Certain jobs require physical strength; roughnecking is the most known job on an oil rig and they need to be very fit. I work as an engineer. I do have to do some manual labor and have vastly increased my knowledge of hand tools (good life skill). If I need help I just ask. If you're polite and helpful, no one will think twice about giving you a helping hand in return. 
[I was looking into trying to do this but im not entirely sure where to start, any suggestions?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qc55a?context=5)|Well it depends what job specifically you're looking for. I'm a field engineer (or MWD), but other options include directional driller, rig hand, safety guy, company man, mud engineer, mud logger, solids control etc...
 |If you're planning on starting from square one (ie no engineering or oilfield background) then you'll likely have to start as a roustabout or a mud logger. Basically their job is cleaning the rig, or taking mud samples respectively. But the industry promotes from within so if you work hard you'll move up.
 |The best way to get a job in my opinion... find a friend of a friend of a friend who has an oilfield job. Beg them to get you an interview or for some contact information and rock the interview. If you don't get the job, you have a contact at the company.
 |If you can't find anyone, I would suggest job fairs in Houston or in oilfield areas could be a good option. There's also rigzone.com which I don't know much about but people talk about it.
 |A friend of mine got hired via a head hunter company, just make sure you use a reputable one that won't scam you. 
[What about for someone starting out with a bachelor's but not in the industry?  Mine's in biology specifically.  Would I still be applying for something like mud logger / roustabout?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qgppj?context=5)|There are people who do the same job as me who did not study engineering (economics, political science, history are the ones I know of). However they were hired to stay in this job for longer then I was. Being that you studied science, I believe that they could hire you as a ""Field Engineer"". I believe that someone in my manager's position in a different location studied biochemistry.
[How much do these jobs (these two, specifically\) demand salary wise?  That's something I always hate filling out on application forms... I never know what to put.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qgppj?context=5)|I never know either. I'd just google the average salary for that job and put right around there.
[Also, you said earlier a ""myriad"" of opportunities?  What kind of opportunities would you expect going from field work to an office or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qgppj?context=5)|Field Service Manager, Drilling Engineer, Reservoir Analysis Engineer, Well Placement Engineer, Sales Engineer, Drilling Service Manager, Training Champion, Recruiter, Instructor, R&amp;D, Operations Support etc... It's a huge company.
[Lastly, is what you do dangerous?  I've seen youtube videos where there's tons of lbs of machinery swinging around these guys who are dipping in and out like it's nothing...  wtf ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qgppj?context=5)|The process of drilling a well has a lot of hazards involved. The videos you see on youtube are more then likely worst case scenarios in which people were cutting corners and trying to save money at the cost of safety. Everyone on site has the right to stop the job if they see unsafe behavior, and are protected by their company if they do so. With that being said, there is a lot of heavy machinery and so injuries and deaths do happen unfortunately. With every job you just need to be careful and adhere to the policies that are set in place with safety in mind.
[You said that you studied chemical engineering. So has your degree helped in getting your current position and do you apply anything that you learnt from being a Chem Eng on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qf94h?context=5)|The degree got me my position and I use nothing I learned on the job.
[One last question, what's an normal day for you on the rig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qf94h?context=5)|There is no such thing as a normal day. After everything is set up and the job is started, theres usually a lot of down time that I can do whatever in as long as things are going smoothly. When something breaks, you're causing lost time (and thus lost money) so it's basically a run your ass of situation until you fix it. Lots of ups and downs. Every day I do attend a safety meeting though. 30 minutes long before my shift. 
[Relatively small jack up rig. no snow. well cleared drilling pad. Im guessing west texas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qckrq?context=5)|Hmmm close :) but you'll never know for sure.
 |Haha just kidding. southeast texas just north of the border. 
[Room mate in college who's a mechanical engineer works on land rigs in Midland. Be glad you're not out there, the housing market is horrible over there so he's got a shitty apartment that's way too expensive despite making enough money to get a decent house if he were anywhere else.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qdipk?context=5)|Yea I've heard some about that. Midland is the North Dakota of Texas. Prices are so high. And it's ugly haha. 
[How did you get set up with a job like that?  Also proof suggestion: Pic of the rig and one with a handwritten timestamp (your username and the date\) held in front of your face.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qbguv?context=5)|The company I work for recruited at the job fair at my university. I applied both for a summer internship (did not get one) and then a full time job a year later. I think my persistence is one of the reasons I got hired. I did a first round interview on my college campus followed by a second round at a job site. 
[Do you think gender played any role?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qgfhk?context=5)|I'm sure it played some role. No idea how much. But other females they interviewed (in both rounds) didn't get hired so I must have been better qualified then someone at least :). 
[That's cool. What drew you to this type of job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qbope?context=5)|There were a couple of reasons why I chose the oil industry.  First off, the promotion opportunities within my company are incredible. My job as a field engineer is a 3-5 year commitment and then I have ""proved myself"" to the company and will have a myriad of opportunities in front of me.  Second, it was the most interesting and challenging job offer I received. The lifestyle and difficulties faced by field workers are very different then in a ""normal job"", and women face even more. I wanted to see if I could handle the pressure and time commitment required.  Third, it is a very high paying job and I wanted to start on saving up a lot of money early instead of struggling out of college. 
[I am assuming since there is still a rig on site that you do open hole logging?  If you do cased hole, do you also perforate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7ql27v?context=5)|I'm out here while drilling... so it's actually real time logging. The tool is right above the bit.
 |You're talking about wireline, and I have no experience in that :)
[Do you think you could have gotten the job you are in without a college degree? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qca67?context=5)|It is possible to get the job without a college degree, but it is likely you would need to be ""an experienced hire"".
 |Roustabouts, roughnecks, and mud loggers are the ""workers"" on the rig and mostly don't have a college education or prior knowledge. Do that entry level job for a few years and learn a lot about the oil industry. Work hard and make a good name for yourself. Start from the bottom and work your way up. 
[What is the housing like for you?  In Alberta, there is such high demand for housing that they supply can't meet the demand so there are multiple oil rig employees living in trailers in such poor conditions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qdui7?context=5)|Housing: I share a trailer with the other people sent out by my company, and maybe a few others. I get my own room for the 12 hours of the day that I'm off, and the 12 hours I'm working that room belongs to the others staying in there. We share a bathroom. The cheaper the client the cheaper the housing and it can get pretty bad, but never uninhabitable. Hopefully someone swoops in on that market opportunity up there and improves the living situation for those workers.
[What are the hours like? What do people working on oil rigs do on their time off? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qdce8?context=5)|We work 12 hour shifts while on the job. Right now I work 2 weeks on and 1 week off, but most people in my area do not have a specific rotation schedule. The percentage of days per year on the rig depends on how busy the location is.
 |People do everything on days off! The age and interests range so far it would be wrong to generalize. I guess to stereotype, a lot of people do hunt. I don't hunt though... I do your typical 23 year old female things like go shopping haha. 
[Interesting, how many shifts a week do you work with the rotating schedule?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qf25p?context=5)|So... when you're on the rig you work every day you're there. You live, eat and breathe the job. That's what they pay you for. So there's myself and one other engineer on the job and we run it. I guess to answer... I work 7 shifts a week haha.
 |Days off you don't work at all. 
[I work in the north east and one of my Uncles who lives in Canada was telling me to get into oil instead of banking as there is a better growth potential. I'm currently applying to all major oil companies in Texas, as well as the one my Uncle works at which he referred me to.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qbfrt?context=5)|I am not in a position right now where I get much exposure to the financial side of the oil business. What I do know is that due to the cyclical nature of the industry, if you want to stay employed and want to stay in the industry, you will need to be willing to move anywhere around the globe.
[What is your take on that? Are you familiar with the finance side of the oil business? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qbfrt?context=5)|While I can't pretend to know much about banking, there is a lot of growth potential in the oil industry and there are a lot of opportunities to become self employed down the road if that interests you.
[Is this something you envision yourself doing for your lifetime?  It seems like pretty grueling work that could wear you down..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qckxc?context=5)|ABSOLUTELY NOT. This is the kind of job that sucks you in because it pays incredibly well. so people end up doing it forever because they need to make this much money to pay all their bills. It's good in the short term because I am saving a lot of money, but it would be incredibly challenging for me to start a family while working in the field.
 |One of the reasons I decided to take this job is because it is a great place to start in the oilfield. The training I am receiving could get me a job as a Drilling Engineer or a Company Man or something at an operator if I wanted to leave the field now. But I want to stay with this company because of the internal career opportunities. I should be out of the field in 2-3 years, and I've been doing it for 1.5.
[So you plan to stay in the company but move out of oil rig work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qgh7a?context=5)|That is the plan. And if I leave the company I'll stay with the industry.
[How many of your co-workers are on meth? Serious question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qds6p?context=5)|I'd like to think none. No one from my company; as stated we get drug tested very very often. As do the roughnecks. Other then that no idea though. 
[Thanks, I guess that is just a stereotype. I've watched too many drug related documentaries.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15w2mv/iama_23_year_old_woman_working_on_an_oil_rig_amaa/c7qdty3?context=5)|Or too much breaking bad?
[Very interesting info here and my congratz to you on that. Im thinking about getting a course on industrial machinery mechanics and maybe a couple of welding courses afterwards. Whats your view on the welders there? Good pay?

I'd heard mixed thoughts on applying for full-time jobs before having a diploma in hand but decided to do it anyway.  

The recruiting manager called me before graduation to ask if I was still interested and just now got back to me to set up the interview.

The job description and location sound great to me and I believe the company could offer plenty of room for growth and travel (relatives of mine work there, but in different business segments than I'm applying for).

At the very least this will be great practice for potential future interviews and give me a better understanding of the company.  Best case scenario I get a job offer.

The past few weeks have been full of bad news for me: my grandmother passed away after suffering through a final bout of pneumonia right before Christmas and my girlfriend broke up with me on New Year's day.  Quite the bummers for the holidays.

So to anyone else who is soon to graduate, start applying!  Many companies at least have a policy of holding on to resumes and cover letters for several months at least.  Also keep applying for internships and co-ops if you've got a while to go in school. I have doubt they've helped me get this interview."

Please help!,drowsavon,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/15xfxk/need_advice_on_transferring_please_help/,"Hi, I'm currently a freshman starting second semester at University of the Pacific in Stockton. I'm majoring in mechanical engineering. Pacific isn't very well known for engineering at all, but it's a private school with lots of interaction between faculty and students, which I enjoy.

In UoP's engineering program, you are required to complete a co-op work experience (paid internship) that lasts seven months, during your undergrad. This sets you up for a job right after graduation. They also guarantee you will graduate in four years and they have a five-year blended master's/bachelor's program.

My parents are heavily pressuring me to transfer to a UC or a school with more prestige in engineering by my junior year. UoP is fairly costly and they're worried about my ability to get a job in the future. I don't know if the value of UoP outweighs the price or not. If I go to a UC, I know I won't enjoy the large class sizes and the feeling of being totally on my own. 

tl;dr: Expensive private school with relatively unknown engineering program but quality interaction between faculty/students OR cheaper UC with large class sizes and the ability to graduate under a ""name brand""?"

I think it would be best if people included a few details about themselves, such as with what field they are in, a brief job description and their experience (education level/degree name, years experiences, internships etc. general non-specific information), while removing any personal details of companies, names and locations of course. It would be best if you could give a country, state or area so people can get a feel of any cultural differences that might occur.

I think this would help people see the differences in successful coverletters between fields and how they might vary, as well as what to include and even simple things such as length and detail to go into. It also might shed light on why their own coverletters aren't as good as they first thought. 

I would contribute further, but I am one of those people looking for jobs and haven't written a coverletter that has successfully got me an interview, so unfortunately I am not much help apart from suggesting it to other people. :( "

15xd1n,2,2013-01-03,GF [F25] and I [M25] having second thoughts during long break up.,LongBreakUp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15xd1n/gf_f25_and_i_m25_having_second_thoughts_during/,"My GF and I have been in a relationship for 4 1/2 years.  We met in college and moved together to go to graduate school.  (I am an engineer and she is in med school)  We have lived together for 3 years.

We have had lots of ups and downs.  Towards the start of our relationship she had an out of town internship for 4 months and I lied about looking at porn.  (she at the time didn't want to be with someone who watched porn)  In the long run looking back, I think the lying was a bigger problem than the porn.  We worked through this, we moved in together.  We got pets and lived a busy full life.  However, both being in graduate school we have never really been able to make enough time for each other.  To top it off, I am not the most open of people.  I have trouble sharing.

Anyway, during our time in graduate school we have had a lot of other ups and downs.  We don't share a lot of the same hobbies and are constantly wrapped up in our own school work.  We have tried setting aside time to do date-like things: go out to breakfast, watch movies together, etc.  But it never really lasts.  Most of the time we just fall back into watching TV, walking our dogs, sleeping, and working.  Our sex life waxes and wanes with the rest of our relationship.

It seems like whenever we try and work on things it changes a little, then we fall back into our old problems.  After several years of this we both just started to become sad often.  I was even a bit depressed for a time.  Eventually it got to a breaking point for her.  After I was away for a week at a conference, she sat me down and said that she thinks it is time we end things.  She said that, even though we love each other, we just aren't happy together.  

We spent several weeks discussing these things and I eventually came to face the facts that we really weren't happy.  For long periods of time we just weren't as happy as we should have been. (or at least could have been)  At this point we both started looking for new housing.  Weeks went by--eventually about two months after the initial break up--and I finally found a place to live.  I signed a month-to-month lease and we both set off to spend the holidays with our families.

On the way back from vacation we started talking a lot.  A lot, a lot.  We started really looking at and addressing many of our problems.  We have been realizing that we are having some serious second thoughts about the break up. (unfortunately after I signed this lease...)  We talked with each other, with our friends/family, even wrote stuff down.  She has realized that she thinks this was a mistake and wants to give us another *serious* attempt.  She has specifically pinpointed many things that she wants to do differently. (by herself and as a couple)  She thinks she hasn't appreciated me enough, she wants to improve our sex life and is open to new things, she wants us to mandate time per week that each of us controls (we tried this before and it didn't work), she wants to try to be more involved in my hobbies, and several others.

This all sounds good to me, a lot of it I really like.  However, this also really scares me.  We love each other but have spent a lot of time not exactly happy.  We have had serious sit down talks about our relationship before; we try to pinpoint things that are wrong and fix them.  However, we always have fallen back into our old bad habits.  This time it seems different: her attitude, the things she wants to change, her enthusiasm, seriousness, openness, etc.  This *does* feel different than the previous times we have tried to change.  Nonetheless, I feel like I have one foot out the door.  I love her, but I am scared, terrified even, that we will do what we always do and end up back where we always do: unhappy.

** *tl;dr*--  Long term relationship with lots of ups and downs.  We have tried to fix things before but always fall back to our old problems.  This time feels different, but I am scared.**"

This is just a side project for me and I'm interested in getting some access experience, although I have fooled around with it in the past. The basic goal is to have an inventory database for a set of 2000-some plants. Each plant already has a unique ID given by the person who collected it as well as other data such as name, origin, # of replications, etc.

The issue I'm running into at the moment is that each unique ID represents several identical plants in different locations. That is, Plant #55 might exist in 3 or 4 different locations. The most important thing I want this database to do is call up two kinds of reports: 

* what plants are in greenhouse X or garden bed Y
* where can I find all instances of plant #Z

The simplest way I can think of doing this is to set an automatic master key and have multiple records of the same plant # each with a different location value, but I have a feeling thats a really bad way to go about it.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

I am a long-time reader and was wondering if any of you had advice regarding my current employment situation.


I am 20 have been working in Southern California for ~1.5 years as an Intern for a medium sized software company (~ 300m-700m usd market cap), and have lived here most of my life. I have stayed in college (at a junior college) and will eventually get my degree in CS, although not around the typical 4 year mark. I get paid $20-22 an hour (between that), after a small raise after the 1 year mark. The discussion was initiated by myself, and there is no formal internship to full-time program for my current position/department. I currently live with a parent in a comfortable arrangement and have been saving most of my money. The work is mostly writing lots of BI reports, SQL queries, website updates, and other small projects. My personal programming skills have been mostly self-taught and cover many languages such as C#, Java, Python, PHP, etc. Web Development and Windows/Java Development. Programming has been my life's passion since I started in middle school.


My problem is that I do not enjoy the work very much, which as mentioned, is mostly writing reports (more IT focused, instead of more CS/development focused). My passion is in actual development, such as Java and .NET (C#), versus the IT-related stuff I am currently doing such as making reports, etc.


As I am currently employed on a ""contract"" basis and do not have a full-time job, my question is this: Should I stay with the company for around up to 12 more months, which is when it is highly likely that I will get a full-time job (according what they have told me)? Or start looking elsewhere in the field of work I actually desire? My true passion and skill is in normal programming languages such as Java and C#, versus writing BI (Business Intelligence) reports I have been writing, even though I have become the top report writer at the company. My reasons for thinking about applying elsewhere, is that I am essentially working as much a full-time employee, and my passion is doing other type of work such as Java and C#. I feel the opportunity cost is possibly too great to wait an additional 12 months, and possibly not even a full-time position in the work I want to be doing long term (even though the field I am in would pay somewhat well).
Note: Although the position is on a ""contract"" basis, I am large part of my team and would regard myself as very well-liked.

Thank you for any advice. (This is a throwaway)"

I traveled for a while with my then girlfriend and we worked at a family business out of state for a couple years. We saved every dime we made there and decided that we had a great idea of our own and took what meager funds we had saved and went back south to open our business idea.


 That same year we got married and then pregnant. Business was good and we weren’t concerned. I had wanted to go back to school for my passion but the time just wasn’t there. I began taking some classes at the local CC while running the shop. Things were going pretty well and then we found that our daughter was not speaking or developing as quickly as she was supposed to. After many tests, she was diagnosed with apraxia and we began paying for her costly therapy sessions 3 times per week.  This is when the credit cards came out since we were not poor enough to get it free, but still not rich enough to afford the treatment without financing. This lead to a pile of debt totally about $60,000. Whilst this was ongoing, we both redoubled our effort both at work and home. I neglected my school for a stint there in the middle, but I buckled back down and budgeted my time a little better and finished my AA. 


I got the idea that 2010 was the year to start my BA. I had a full head of steam and was buoyed by my daughter’s recovery and her strides forward. I have always loved Political Science and law so I figured what better field to get my degree in than something I loved. I majored in PS and minored in Law. During the two years I was at the 4-year school our own business felt the hardest pinch of the economy. Our customers just were not spending the same as they had been. Our landlord had raised the rent and several unforeseen emergencies had tapped us out of extra operational funds. After nearly a decade in business, we closed our doors in November.  Then in December I finished my degree graduating with honors (Dec 2012). I have been applying for jobs and attending interviews non-stop since graduation. I have yet to get even a nibble.


 I had an internship that was supposed to pan out with a job for the clerk but cutbacks from the governor’s office froze my offer and I walked away with merely a heartfelt letter of recommendation and a law school referral.  Since then my only lighthouse has been that I was accepted into both the Ms CIS:Computer Science and MBA program at a state university in for May 2013. I can combine the two degrees and graduate with both.  I have a ton of business experience and such so I would much rather have found some good employment and perhaps go to school part time while working. Seemingly, this is not to be. I must have filled out over 120 job applications with no takers, made a 100% complete linked in, got on careershift, monster, indeed, etc. 


On top of this back in July despite contraception my wife became pregnant again and now we have a baby boy due on the 21st of January. 



I just do not know what else to do. I suppose I will start applying at grocery stores, Staples, Walmart, Target, Sears, etc as apparently I can’t get a good job and we need money. It hurts to have to apply for jobs I held during HS.  


What am I missing in my job applications? Is my experience combined with the degree just not suitable for any good job?


I have never been depressed before in my life, but .......

Here is my lame-duck resume:

I will take any advice that I can. Please help me. I need some direction. I feel like a storm knocked me off course and now I am lost.

15x37a,1,2013-01-03,I am an Accounting Major considering a CS minor. Should I?,InTheDarkDancing,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15x37a/i_am_an_accounting_major_considering_a_cs_minor/,"Well here's the deal, I was originally a CS/EE major then switched to Accounting. I'm 1 year away from my accounting degree and have a pretty sweet internship lined up, but I need 150 credits for my professional license (CPA) which means I'd need to take an extra semester of school. I've always been interested in technology/programming, but if I'm being brutally honest, the only reason I originally quit CS was because I was being lazy, not lack of interest. I've considered switching back to CS or double majoring multiple times, but I'm content with the opportunities an accounting degree offers, plus I'm $60k+ in debt so I don't have the financial leverage to stay in school another 2.5 years.

However, since I'm only 3-4 courses short of a CS minor, and since I have to get 150 credits anyway for my CPA, I can get a CS minor without extending the time I need to stay in school and I was wondering how much of a benefit that would look down the road compared to just programming as a hobby as I do now? I've seen people mention multiple times that minors don't help you at all, and if that were the case, I'd rather just take fun classes like dance or acting and program on the side rather than get a worthless minor."

What's the threshold for thank-you's? Obviously they will all receive in-person or at least email thank-you's and an outcome follow up (for the one who works way across campus in another department). Should I write and deliver a thank-you note for LOR's even if it's to my advisor or a profesor I have many classes with? (And do I hand it to them, slip it under the door, put it in their box?!) How much help before a gift of gratitude becomes appropriate?

Recently, I came upon this fairly obvious epiphany that people who choose to dye their hair in non-traditional colors (ex. the varying shades of blue, green, red, orange, purple, pink, etc.) face a lot of issues regarding public attention, scrutiny, judgment, etc. Of course, the non-traditional hair color movement is growing, but in general, people with non-traditional hair colors are still in the minority.

That being said, [my last hair color](http://i.imgur.com/HsBL9.jpg) (bangs only, rest of hair kept natural black) was a bright green/turquoise. I used Manic Panic's Atomic Turquoise (amplified) and was absolutely in love with the color. I am a university student, so I am able to get away with wearing non-traditional hair colors.

However, I just took on an internship with a social services agency that is fairly liberal. Their dress code is definitely business casual, but a bit more ""casual"". However, as the new intern, I do not wish to rouse anyone and jeopardize my position with ""outrageous"" colored hair.

For those with experience with non-traditional hair colors - what do you believe are the most accepted non-traditional hair colors in professional work settings? Please indicate the specific shade &amp; brand (ex. Burgandy Wine/Special Effects USA, Shocking Blue/Manic Panic, etc.)

On a related note, what do you all think of the ""professionalism"" of bright orange color hair? [example](http://3.media.haircrazy.info/photos/gallery/2011/01/16/110116-120631_t_w500_h500.jpg)

1612qn,3,2013-01-05,The Day of the Brother,[deleted],shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1612qn/the_day_of_the_brother/,"The streetlights cast a forlorn light over the man, trudging slowly through the alleyway. His well-tailored suit, pristine shoes and immaculately coiffured hair gave the impression of success. The buildings on either side of the road loomed over him, their iron-shuttered shopfronts grinning at the man as he strode ever onward.  His colleagues called him arrogant, his CV talked of a “driven and determined personality”. He was Lucius Green, millionaire banker, tax avoider, and owner of the 3rd largest collection of Lamborghinis in the world. He didn’t like this part of town, he thought, as he zipped up his designer coat and looked warily over his shoulder.

“Save yourself!, for the day of the brother is almost upon us!”

A crazed and bedraggled old man shuffled up to Lucius, his eyes darting around inside his head like ants in a Petri dish. He was wearing nothing more than rags.

“Pardon?” Lucius answered, maintaining politeness while trying hard not to spit in the old fool’s face. He didn’t have time for this.

“The alignment has begun! Those in rags shall be saved, kings shall be overthrown! The riches of nations will turn to ruin! There will be no greater day than the day of the brother!”

The man began to shriek, flecks of phlegm hitting Lucius’ priceless clothing. “heed my words!” he screamed. Spooked, the banker began to run. He hailed a taxi and was back in the leafy womb of Knightsbridge, or “civilization” as he called it, in no time.

Lucius woke up and lazily pawed through his smartphone’s news app.  It was the usual mix of tragedy in the Middle East and governmental incompetence at home. But something caught his eye.

“Reports are surfacing that the King of Tonga, Tupou VI, has been deposed and killed at his extravagant palace by a mob of dissidents. Their motive remains unknown.”

*Kings shall be overthrown…*

A coincidence, surely. Lucius put down his phone and rolled out of bed. Another long day of making millions in the City awaited him, and all of it would go straight to his offshore account in…

“Tonga…” he said aloud.

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin…*

Another coincidence, surely. 

Lucius strolled through the marble and glass hallways of his building, and was at his desk in seconds. He checked his email, informing him of his ever-larger bank balance.

Life was good. 

Until the phone rang.

“Mr Green, I am calling from Brother Capital. It seems that due to the unforeseen circumstances in Tonga, your account has been frozen, and therefore you will not be able to use any of your assets”

The man down the line had a grey, monotonous voice. He was not someone to start an argument with.

Lucius slowly put down the phone.

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin….*

Did the old man have a point?

Brother Capital…

“Don’t be such a bloody fool!” Lucius barked at himself. Today was one of those days better spent on the deck of your yacht.

He was just unlucky that his account got frozen because of some political unrest in some unfathomably hot corner of the world… was he? He shook his head and turned on Bloomberg.

The colour red hit him first. Red arrows, pointing down, all across the bottom of the screen. His eyes widened in disbelief. The news anchor was frantic, trying to keep up with collapsing stocks across the world. NASDAQ, FTSE, DAX… all plummeting. 

A single bead of sweat rolled down Lucius’ face. This was terminal. He had £60 million invested across the world, he was never going to get it all back… 

Was there a way out?

*Those in rags shall be saved…*

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin…*

“He was right!”  “He was right!” Lucius sprinted out of the room, knocking two interns out of the way with frantic force. He spilled out of the building and onto the road, still screaming at the top of his lungs. He tore at his Ralph Lauren shirt and proclaimed to the sky:

“Save yourself! For the day of the brother is upon us!”

He was at once accosted by an angry taxi driver.

“You don’t understand! You’ll never understand!, It’s all over! The day is upon us!”

The ragged banker turned, and sprinted down an alleyway.

**Stock Glitch Terrifies World**

A glitch in the international stock exchange system terrified the world’s bankers, and left many people believing they were destitute, it has emerged. The glitch, which lasted for two hours yesterday afternoon, saw stocks fall by 40% worldwide. The glitch is believed to be connected to various ‘hacktivist’ groups across the Internet. The IMF has assured the world that no money has been lost, and the current status of the world economy is one of “normality”.

I'm trying to decide which career I should pursue. Here are some key factors of my decision:

* I am 23, about to finish my masters in international business and economics.
* I have always had a passion for creative arts such as writing and painting. However, I decided to go for business and economics since it appeared more practical and flexible to me. I figured I could still do anything I wanted with that degree, and decide later on.
* So my idea had been to combine my creativity and artistic skills with my formal education by going into marketing or advertising. I spent the last year doing internships as a designer for various companies and products, including package design and web design. 
* However, I felt a bit dishonest in this trade. Many times it seemed like tricking folks into believing things about products I knew were untrue or irrelevant. So I was left insecure about my once dream job at a creative marketing agency. I definitely want to have a job that is honest and helps the progress of society. Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic, but I value that more than good pay or prestige.
* So far, what has come to my mind is a career in Urban Design. Helping communities improve their infrastructure or making cities more sustainable, something along the lines of that. But I feel like there have to be some other career paths out there which I am missing. Maybe I am simply not aware of some of the jobs that exist. After all, it took me 22 years to discover the Urban Design thing.

**tl;dr** I am looking for a career that 1. is creative 2. has to do with business/economics and 3. contributes to a better world. So far I have come up with Urban Design. Am I missing any career opportunities out there?"

You can look in my post history to see the long, drawn out story I wrote, I was in a pretty bad place.

Long story short, after deciding to transfer schools for our almost 2 year relationship a few months back, and her dumping me a couple of weeks before I moved (over the phone when I was coming up the next day for orientation anyway, she didn't bother to wait), I was depressed as all hell. After dragging myself through the mud for awhile, I talked to my family over Christmas. 

They helped me realize that I was very codependant in my relationship, and my natural independence I had possessed my whole life slowly faded away as the months went on. I wanted it back. 

In a span of five days, I re-enrolled at my old school, regained my financial aid, was accepted into my program, found a flat downtown at a good price, and regained my old job. On top of that, I nailed an interview for an internship (which is unfortunately near her, but there are always downsides) and start that in the summer.

What I'm trying to say is, although I still think and dream about her every single day, find yourself again. Find that person you were, and don't be afraid to do anything in your power to get it back. Be strong, independent, and motivated. 

I called her once three days after the breakup, never got a call back, and that was it for me, I got the picture. I boxed her stuff up (threw it out a couple of days ago), and blocked her and her family on all social media. That starts the healing process.

Everybody heals in their own way, and certain days are still a struggle for me, but just stay strong and positive. YOU deserve better, just be who you really are. And in your next relationship, never ever give that up for any reason.

Thanks r/Breakups for all your help. Stay strong, and be positive. We are all in this together. It's always darkest before the dawn."

15zzfw,0,2013-01-05,Undergraduate looking for summer research,[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/15zzfw/undergraduate_looking_for_summer_research/,"I'm a first-year undergraduate student at a large research university. I'm planning on majoring in something in the humanities or social sciences, but am completely unsure as to what specifically. But I know that I really, really, really like learning and plan on going to graduate school for an MA/PhD, and I've already talked to one of my professors about doing research for him (if his grant is approved). 


But I've been looking into summer research opportunities and I've found a couple I think I'll apply to (despite the deadlines being about a month away). I've looked at SROP, the Leadership Alliance, and individual programs at Virginia Tech, Columbia, Berkeley, and I'm still searching. Hopefully I'll have a made a list within the next couple days and ask my professors for recommendations/start filling out the apps. I have a 4.0, sophomore status (29 credits from high school + 19 first semester), and I did a public service internship with an on campus club this semester.


I'm just getting really intimidated as I start looking at the apps. I'm a white middle class second generation student, and a lot of fellowships I've found so far are geared towards underprivileged/underrepresented students, particularly those who have finished their second year. When looking through applications, I'm not sure what to enter in under my major. I came in with a lot of AP credits and so fulfilling a major or even a double/triple major at my university shouldn't be too challenging, so I guess I should just put something that I'm relatively interested in just to fill up that field? And I'm nervous about asking my professors for recommendations...my own professor (that I'll do research for pending his grant approval) should be fine, but since I've only had five professors ever total the second recommendation won't be fantastic. That and the fact that I have no research experience yet makes me wonder my chances for actually getting an undergraduate research position.


I'd be happy doing research anywhere, I basically would just really enjoy the chance to spend the summer learning in a new part of the country. Ideally it would provide food/housing as well as an additional stipend, but one or the other would still be fantastic. 


Does reddit have any input on my chances at actually getting a research position/advice for filling out apps/recommendations for other programs to look into?

I spent way too much time indulging myself in purposeless activities, and I ended up neglecting my studies. 

I walked into my economics final without a single hour of studying, and ended up failing the course outright. My grades in other classes aren't doing so great either. I have a 2.0 GPA. 

I intend on not letting this happen ever again, but as a 3.7 GPA high school student facing a 2.0 college GPA, this is exceptionally disconcerting, and I'm a little shell-shocked right now, to say the least. I should have seen this coming earlier, but this is all hitting me very hard right now. 

Redditors, I sincerely ask you guys to give me any advice on what I can do, and if there's any 'hope' for me after college. I keep hearing that internships require a 3.0+ GPA, as well as some job requirements, and I am far from this.

Him -22M
Together for almost 6 years, living together since last August

Long story short, we started a long distance relationship that lasted for 4 years until he moved down here a year and a half ago. Our relationship has slowly gotten worse since we moved in together. On paper our relationship is pretty good, everything my SO does is to make me happy but I just don't feel it. I used to love him with everything I had and now I find myself looking forward to when he goes to work so I can have some time alone. I don't look forward to when he comes into my room to cuddle. It's usually uncomfortable when we have sex because I'm not in the mood but I agreed a few months ago that we'd have sex every Friday so we do. 

I'm mostly confused because these feelings are new, sort of. They've never been this intense before and I just don't know what to do. Our relationship isn't passionate and exciting, and while I know that love isn't always like that and that it takes work, I just don't want this huge commitment anymore. If I wanted to be married I would be, but I don't.

If we were still long distance, I would probably break up with him. My main issue is he moved here to be with me. He doesn't really have any of his own friends and I basically feel like I robbed him of the last almost 2 years because he could've been making a life for himself at home but he came here to make me happy. I'm pretty sure I would destroy his whole world by doing this and I just don't know how to do that to someone who's loved me unconditionally for almost 6 years.

My second issue is we both have a lease to the same apartment until August (though I am leaving in May for an internship so if he stayed here while I was gone it wouldn't be bad but that's a while from now) but more than that is we need to decide soon where we'd want to live next year so I couldn't wait until May to talk about breaking up if we'd already signed a lease somewhere else.

Honestly, I just don't know what to do. We've had such an amazing relationship up until now that I'm worried these feelings might pass and I've broken his heart for nothing. I don't know if I should wait, what to say when he talks about looking for apartments. I don't know a way to bring this up for discussion without ending it right there and I don't know how to function after that in the same apartment. I just don't know anything, other than currently I'm not happy.

**TL;DR: Been together almost 6 years (4 LDR 1.5 living together) and relationship has declined since living together. I'm craving alone time and don't know what that means in the long run. If the right thing to do is to break up, I also don't know how to go about doing that due to living arrangements.**

15zpx6,12,2013-01-04,I think I'm just going to give up on being a lawyer.,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/15zpx6/i_think_im_just_going_to_give_up_on_being_a_lawyer/,"I graduated from a t4 (first mistake) school in 2011.  I was originally planning on living in the state the law school was in so I didn't think it would be that big of a deal.  Plus when I started back in 2008, the damage to the legal economy was pretty much uncertain, so I figured I would at least get *something* when I graduated.  I did my summer internships which were both good and had pretty good grades.

Fast forward to 2011.  I graduate, and am signed up to take Barbri for the state bar exam.  I am informed by the loan company that traditionally gives bar study loans to students from our school that I am being denied my loan.  I can't find anyone to cosign, so Barbri goes unpaid and I'm out of the class.  I spend the summer miserably trying to study by myself and struggling to pay rent/utilities.  Failed the first time around.

Fast forward to winter 2011.  Spent the last 6 months pretty much flat broke going from sublease to sublease because I can't afford an actual lease.  I am able to get a few temp jobs doing random stuff paying $13 an hour, but it's not enough to pay for anything.  I probably should have moved back home with my parents, but I was in a serious relationship at the time and living with my significant other who was then a student (mistake #2).  Don't have enough money to pay for the bar exam fees, let alone Barbri, so I don't even bother.

Eventually I decided to end my shitty relationship, move home, get into Barbri, and take the exam.  I bust my ass, pass the exam for 2 states, and everything's looking good, right?  Nope.  I have a DUI on my record from a few years ago, and the past year of bullshit made my credit go to shit.  So now my application is still being held up and the character and fitness committee keeps asking for document after document which takes a huge amount of time and effort to get since I don't live in the state anymore.

I've been working a volunteer position at my state's Attorney General's office since Sept., and they've made no indication that they plan on hiring me full-time.  Even so, the c+f committee is pretty much making it seem like they're going to make me jump through hoops for the next year before ultimately rejecting me.  I've literally been flat broke for the past year and a half.  I had to get rid of my car because I can't afford the repairs.  I work 7 days a week, 4 days a week at a retail job that pays me just above minimum wage, which gives me just enough money to cover the hour and a half train commute the other 3 days a week to my volunteer job.  In my spare time, I sit around by myself.  This has literally been the worst experience of my life and there's just no end in sight.  I haven't even begun to touch my student loans, which have already racked up $10k in interest.  If I could do anything it would be to go back in time and not go to law school.  I want to just give up, but I don't know what I would do.  I just can't keep going like this anymore."

Hi r/starcraft, I'm looking for any opportunity to do something in E-sports for money after I'm graduating 12th June.

Most people I read about who wants to get involved in E-sports are recommended to start out as a volunteer, and so I did. Soon one year ago I joined the Swedish E-sports news website [Rakaka.se](http://www.rakaka.se) (you have probably heard of it, right?) as a simple editor. Being an editor is not very simple though.


### Online


Since I started at Rakaka in March 2012 I've done this:
    
* published [137 news articles](http://www.rakaka.se/index.php?do=search&amp;search=chop&amp;type=3&amp;news=1)    
* published [213 videos](http://www.rakaka.se/index.php?do=search&amp;search=chop&amp;type=3&amp;news=2) or other similar content (the ones linked to the right at [Rakaka.se](http://www.rakaka.se))    
* published [47 articles](http://rakaka.se/index.php?do=search&amp;search=chop&amp;type=3&amp;news=3) involving stream embedds and similar

That's a total of [**397** articles](http://www.rakaka.se/index.php?do=search&amp;search=chop&amp;type=3&amp;news=0). I do also wanna point out that it took some time to get my feet wet, most of these posts are actually from after August when I started to post about **50-100** articles a month instead of my earlier average of **10** posts a month.




### WCS Europe Finals (Stockholm, Sweden)


* In September I visited WCS Europe Finals to make coverage together with [bobhund](http://reddit.com/u/bobhund). Together we produced 6 interviews with [MaNa](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19822), [Seiplo](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19823), [BabyKnight](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19832), [SortOf](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19833), [ThorZaIN](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19834) and [Grubby](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19835). The only one I did was with SortOf though and it didn't go very well, but it was my first interview, and I expect to improve at it. I recorded the other interviews that [bobhund](http://twitter.com/_bobhund_) did and also two [walk-arounds](http://www.rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=19818). Since this was my first event as press I learned a lot about how to do event coverage, interviews and etc. 




### DreamHack Winter 2012 (Jönköping, Sweden)


In November I visited DreamHack for my 6th time.


Together with [Iceman](https://twitter.com/nameci), [Ciaiei](https://twitter.com/ciaiei), Grue and [EndarSpire](http://twitter.com/EndarSs) from Rakaka I produced a ton of videos. We made 17 interviews only with StarCraft-related people. I did [one with TLO](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=20089) which didn't become very good either, but I didn't give up because of that.    


* [r/starcraft post with interviews](/http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/13rmyx/great_bunch_of_dreamhack_interviews/)


I did also get to use our Canon EOS 7D a lot more and took some nice pictures, two of them made it to the frontpage of r/starcraft.    


* [TLO photobombing Western Wolves](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/13o05j/tlo_photobombing_western_wolves/)    


* [Weird picture of the Liquid family](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/13pucz/weird_picture_of_the_liquid_family/)    




### THOR Open (Stockholm, Sweden)


Two weeks after DreamHack Winter I went to THOR Open together with [EndarSpire](http://twitter.com/EndarSs) to make some more coverage since it went well at DreamHack. Here we focused on covering every game (there was about 7 different tournaments) so we didn't get a lot of StarCraft content, but we managed to talk to VortiX, his brother Ryo, Ourk and Bischu. 

* [r/starcraft post with links](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/14kgnp/a_great_bunch_of_interviews_from_thor_open_2012/).    
* I did also make [an okay 9 min interview with the Swedish Dota 2 player Akke](http://rakaka.se/index.php?newsID=20199) (currently playing for No Tidehunter).


Next event I plan to go to is IEM Katowice in Poland.


### Other than Rakaka?


Before Rakaka I was involved a lot in the Online Arena PvP game [Bloodline Champions](http://www.bloodlinechampions.com) for about two years.  A game developed by the Swedish company [Stunlock Studios](http://www.stunlockstudios.com) and published by [Funcom](http://www.funcom.com), tailored for E-sports. Sadly it didn't succeed very well but [James Harding (2GD)](http://twitter.com/follow2GD), who worked as an E-sports Manager for the project, managed to get the community three DreamHack tournaments where I participated and finished at 5th place out of 16 all three times. [Semmler](http://twitter.com/Semmler_) who works for [The GD Studio](http://www.reddit.com/r/thegdstudio) does also come from the BLC community.


* In BLC I was a part of a group of the best players called ""council"" who gave feedback on the balance of the game and tested out new patches on a QA (Quality Assurance) server.


* I did also run a daily news blog about the scene, which can be found [here](http://choperi.us/archive).


### Who am I?


18-year-old from Sweden, currently living in Stockholm studying Natural Science at the ""gymnasium"" (similar to High School I guess). I'm graduating at the 12th of June though, therefore I'm looking for something to do after school. 


Apart from E-sports I played chess before, I keep pretty good track of the public debate in Sweden, like to discuss on forums and read books. I have also begun to work-out.

### What do I want to do?


I'm very passionate about E-sports in general and perceive myself as very open minded. Actually, for now I'm open for anything that can give me enough to pay my rent where I'm going to live. I'm good at writing and interested in social media. I'm open for most countries around the world, though Germany is appreciated since I want to get better at German, which is my third language after Swedish and English.


Internships, full-time or part-time are all interesting.

### Where can I reach you?


You can reach me at

* Skype (ch0ppen)


* E-mail (alexander.holzmann.ekholm@gmail.com)

* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit?locale=en_US&amp;trk=hb_tab_pro_top)


### tl;dr:
I'm looking for opportunities in esports, summer/fall 2013. I've been volunteering for Rakaka.se for soon a year and done coverage at three big events. Got any tips?




That's all, I'm thankful for every tip or comment,

The problem is it's been really one-sided. We're 3 hours apart but I'm always the one visiting her. I'm always the one calling her. I'm always the one trying to Skype her. I've invited her to visit on several occasions and she's always busy; she can't even come for one day out of the weekend despite all the times that I drove to visit her. So since she is ""busy"" during the school year I invited her to visit after her exams were over, but she still didn't come up. It gets exhausting and I feel like not asking her out anymore because I always know that the answer will ""no"".

I'm partly in the wrong for all this because I never expressed to her how much this has been bothering me. I guess I just bottle it all up because I don't want to seem ""needy"" or whatever. But we got in a little fight over Christmas break where I ended up saying ""I don't know if I can do this anymore"". She thought that meant I was breaking up with her and got really mad and didn't talk to me for a couple days. 
We talked on the phone the other day and basically established that we need to work on our communication, but before I could get to how I was feeling about the stuff above she said she had to go to bed to get up early.

Today she's in the process of moving to another city (only 2 hours away) for an internship so she's pretty busy, so two nights ago I called her hoping we could talk about stuff since she probably wouldn't want to do it during move-in weekend. She apparently was out with friends and said she was really tired but that we will talk tomorrow (last night). But once again last night she blew me off and said she couldn't talk and said she was too tired and that her phone was dying. Which is always the excuse.

I was upset by that and haven't talked to her or texted her since, and she hasn't made any effort to talk to me. Is this situation salvageable at all? Should I try contacting her or should I wait until she contacts me? I hate playing stupid games but honestly I'm tired of always trying to get ahold of her because right now I have no idea if she cares about me or not.

I want to be with her but I can't be with her if things are always going to be like this. I thought things would start to get ""better"" since we agreed we would work on communicating better, but since she ended up blowing me off and hasn't tried talking to me since I'm not sure any more.

**TL;DR Girlfriend has never put in much work in our relationship. We got in a fight last week and haven't talked much lately; afterwards we said we were going to work on communicating better but she ended up blowing me off and hasn't talked to me since. Should I do anything at this point? Thanks**

I have this weird habit of breaking the pop tab off of every can I drink, however this time it fell into the can. This happened before, so I didn't really think anything of it and just continued drinking. Until... GULP. I felt the pop tab come along with my drink. I instinctively gulped at the feeling of something lodging its way into my esophagus. I tried to cough but nothing came out. I even cut the can open with a butter knife (which is not an easy task!) to make sure I didn't spit it back out. The pop tab was nowhere to be seen, so it had to be inside me.

The next day I didn't really remember the whole thing and went to the toilet without looking behind me. Until a few hours later I started getting terrible cramps in my gut. So I called my GP, who told me to get to the hospital and have an x-ray taken. 

After the x-ray was taken I was waiting in the hospital hallway with my mother and sister, when the intern who was there with the radiologist came out of the room, smiled at us uncomfortably and walked off... returning a minute later with a can of coke!

He told us they weren't sure if the aluminium of the pop tab was even visible on an x-ray, so he was sent off to fetch another can and they took an x-ray of just the pop tab. 

In the end the pop tab was visibile, but there wasn't one inside me. At least not anymore. The cramps have gone away by now. 

At least I know not to drop the pop tab into the can anymore!"

My girlfriend told me something over the phone and i start worrying about it. But first let me explain the whole situation. We know each other from our hometown, but we never talked with each other. Then, we both started studying in the same city and we started dating and becoming a couple. Just after a few weeks in our relationship she told me she is in love with me and had crush on me for years. 

The relationship went great but half a year ago she dropped out of university and started an internship an hour drive away from my university. So at the moment we only see each other every second weekend because of her long working hours and during the holidays. Next summer she will move to another city (5hour drive).

We had our ups and downs but i am still very happy and she made me a better man. I stopped smoking and excessive drinking and also started to work out. But in the last months she became kind of strange. She started meeting with new friends but did not tell me about it. It always came up later by accident. Also she refuses to tell me about these new friends. I don't want to be the jealous type of boyfriend but I want to know what my girl is doing and who she is hanging out with. Is this wrong? She also set her fb relationship status(something i normally don't care about) to invisible. =/

She just called me an hour ago. She said we have something to talk about. She thinks i want to stay with her forever and she has the feeling that i want to marry her and have the kids with her someday. But she says this is kind of unlikely. She doesn't want me to be disappointed if we break up.

Wow…my answer was that i am very happy to be with her, but i now that life is a rocky road, specially for us because i will stay in university for at least another 2 years and she will have also years of education 5 hours away. So I am not expecting to marry her, but right now i am very happy to be with her and i love her and of course i am hoping that we will stay together, but time will tell.


She did not say she love me back but she was kind of satisfied with this answer. I told her if she wants to break up with me and she said no.

After she hung up, i started thinking. It kind of looks to me like she already knows that our relationship has an expiry date and that she might planning breaking up with me in the near future. 
It is kind of hard for me because when we are together everything is easy and great and we are happy. But when we are talking over the phone she always seems so distant. It seems she has a new life now and i am no part of it anymore and this won't get better when she is 5 hours away.

Next time she is going to visit me i am gonna talk with her about it. I want to know what exactly is bothering her. And i also will tell her that if she is planning to end our relationship in the summer because of the long distance, we should end it right now. I hope she is honest.

Is this a good idea?  Is it too much to want to know with whom she is spending her evening in a bar? Or should i just keep my mouth shut?

Thanks for reading, i would appreciate any advice!



tl;dr i have the feeling that my gf is planning to break up with me."
162j09,16,2013-01-06,Miles Moon - Slither Hunter,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/162j09/miles_moon_slither_hunter/,"You know how some people spend their entire lives wishing things were different, hoping that something will come along and make everything more interesting? They’re the type of people that spend so much time complaining that they’re bored, they never do anything to combat the boredom. Well I wasn’t one of those people, I was happy with things just the way they were.

The name’s Miles Moon, once upon a time I was a normal guy, a writer of sorts, just making my way through life and taking everything as it came. Very few interesting events happened, it was peaceful, I liked it that way.
 But good things don’t stay that way, and the day I was enlisted turned my quiet existence on it’s head, now I’m Miles Moon - Slither Hunter, and nothing is ever going to be the same again.

You’re probably wondering what a Slither is. You know about them, or the affect that they have anyway. Slithers are creatures from the dawn of creation, beings that don’t quite belong in our dimension, but have made it their home anyway, Slithers are a cause of nightmares, depression, murders and suicide, and for the most part, they’re also a damn nuisance. 

There’s a chance you’ve seen one, if you’ve ever seen something out of the corner of your eye, or felt a breeze in a draft-free room, then you’ve most likely come into contact with a Slither, and you should be afraid, because where there’s a Slither, there’s trouble.

							               ***

I remember the first time I saw one, though I didn’t know what it was back then. It was the day of my Grandfathers funeral, and we were standing around the grave, I was too young to really understand death, only five, looking back I’m amazed that I was even at the gravesite. 

 It appeared after the priest had finished and the family had been left to grieve, everyone was standing around hugging each other and crying, I was holding my mum’s hand while she cried into my father’s shoulder, not really sure what I was supposed to do. I was sad, sure, I loved my Popo, but I’d accepted that I wouldn’t see him again. 

That’s when I saw it, the Slither, it was hanging around outside the circle of family and friends, at first I could only see it in glimpses as it passed behind people. Curiosity got the better of me and I let go of my mothers hand, it seemed to be going around and around the circle, so I stepped out in front of it, just before it passed us by.

The world froze, birds that had been singing were instantly silenced, and the noises of mourning vanished. It stopped and looked at me, I don’t think it knew what to do, it sort of swished it’s head from side to side, as though searching for something. It was ugly, it’s rather hard to forget what a Slither looks like. 

Imagine a tadpole, but grey in colour and about fifty times bigger, the size of a full grown adult, they float above the ground as though they’re swimming in water, and their tails seem to turn into mist before disappearing completely. They have arms of a sort too, protruding from just under the head, they’re long and spindly things, with two joints in each that might be elbows, they end at a point, which when spread turns into a four fingered hand, there are no nails, but their skin ends up the width of a needle on each finger.

The heads are harder to describe, they don’t really have one, there’s a bulge and the body just sort of rounds off at the front, where they keep their face. The faces are interesting, they take on the likeness of the last person who’s life they’ve affected, and keep it until their next pray succumbs. The faces they take are lifeless, with grey orbs instead of eyes and a mouth that turns into a black emptiness past the teeth. The one that I saw on the day of my grandfathers funeral will stay with me forever, because it was wearing his face.

It made up it’s mind about what to do next, snapping it’s face back to me, looking at me with a cold and dead version of my grandfathers eyes, and it started to advance. I didn’t move, I was scared, but something was stopping me, I willed my legs to turn around and run, but they didn’t.

 It crept closer by the second, I found myself unable to look away from those eyes, and I was sure that it was opening it’s mouth wider and wider the closer it got, I tried to scream, but my mouth was following my legs example and stayed firmly closed.

 I could feel a chill on my face when it was inches away, I started to think about the next week, when it would be my grave the adults were crowded around, and my mum would be crying even harder than today.

 Then a strange thing happened, there had been no sound since I'd locked eyes with the creature, but there was sound now, a low hum that seemed to be coming from all around, the Slither must have heard it too, because it suddenly started to back away, thrashing from side to side, it’s form seeming to bulge and bubble, before exploding in front of my eyes.

The second it exploded I could move again, and it was just in time to cover my face with my arms, making sure I got none of the creature on me. When I lowered my arms again I saw a figure walking towards me.

“Name?” The man asked, as he put a metallic object back into his pocket, and took a notebook out of the other.

“What?” I could feel my eyes welling up with tears, I looked around for my mum, but the adults were all frozen in place, it was silent again.

“Look kid, I’m sorry that I have to do this, but you’re a Hunter, and we’re fighting a losing battle, so we need everyone.” The man sighed, he flipped open the notebook to a clean page and knelt down so that he was at my level.

“Miles... Miles Moon.” I could feel my lip quivering as I said it, the man looked at me sadly, before writing the name in the book and patting me on the shoulder.

							               ***

That’s what I remember of the day, for the longest time I was scared of what I saw, but as I gradually got older I started to forget, my memories faded as childhood memories often do, and the Slither, along with the man, disappeared into the haze.

I managed to forget about them for seventeen years, during that time I led a nice and normal life, going to university, getting an internship, and eventually landing an awesome writing job. Everything was falling into place, but all that changed on my 22nd birthday, when I was visited by the person that would change my life. 

I’d decided on a quiet one, just a small gathering of friends at a local restaurant, I’ve never been one for big parties, so I was happy to just spend the day with those that were closest to me. The place was nearly empty by the time we’d finished eating, and I think the waiters were sick of living up to their name, I asked for the cheque. 

My girlfriend, Alex, leaned over to me as the waiter skipped towards the register, and whispered into my ear.

“Hey, I don’t want to freak you out, but that man over there has been staring at you since we got here, don’t make it obvious.” She squeezed my hand under the table and lifted my finger to point to the man, I casually took a swig from my drink and looked at him over the top of the glass.

He was younger than I was, hardly a man at all, probably still a teenager, but Alex was right, he was staring right at me, and the plate of food in front of him had barely been touched. He saw me looking, and stood up.

“Everyone ready to go?” I turned to the group, who were playing the ‘how many toothpicks can you get to support each other' game, none of them paid attention to me.

The man walked around our table and straight up to me, Alex squeeze my hand again, before turning around to watch the toothpick contest with faux fascination.

“Mr Moon?” The man extended a hand, I took it. 

That was the second time in my life when the universe stood still, all of the tiny movements around me suddenly stopped, the sound of the register broke off mid slam, and the beginning of shouts from my friends were instantly silenced. I turned to see a handful of toothpicks half way to the tabletop, and Steve with a mad grin on his face stood above them.

“Cool.” I turned to the young man who’s hand I was still holding, he smiled.

“I’m impressed, most people usually start with ‘What the-,’ not ‘Cool.’” He let go of my hand and grabbed a chair from the table behind us. “My name is Rathford, and it’s a pleasure to meet you Miles Moon.”

“Are you like him? That man?” My childhood memories had come flooding back to me the moment that the universe froze, I remembered the creature at my grandfathers funeral, and the man that had taken my name.

“I am, and I’m here for you Mr Moon, I’m going to offer you a job.” 

“I have a job.” I responded, picking up my drink to take another swig, it didn’t work, the liquid stayed defiantly at the bottom of the glass, Rathford grinned.

“You don’t have a job like this one, you’re a Hunter Miles, the ability was temporarily buried by my co-worker until you were ready, but it’s about to come back in full.”

“What ability?” I put the glass down, hoping I hadn’t looked too foolish.

“The power to see the Slithers.”

“Slithers? You mean that grey tadpole thing?”  Rathford laughed at the description.

“I suppose they do look a bit like tadpoles don’t they, but yes, they’re the Slithers, and there’s considerably more than just the one at your grandfathers funeral.”

							               ***

So that’s my story, and here I am, fighting in a war that I didn’t even know existed until my 22nd birthday. The Slithers are the scourge of the earth, and if there weren’t people like me keeping them at bay, then they’d run rampant and destroy us in weeks.

I don’t know what makes me special, Rathford told me that they haven’t worked out why some people can see the Slithers and most can’t, but they’re hoping to try and find out, it could be the key to a decisive victory against them, and the end to the suffering.

Ah yes, the suffering, I should probably qualify this. See it’s a hard life for myself and the other Slither Hunters, we’re tasked with tracking down and exterminating them, until such time as we can find out which hell they come from and close the door. We have to give up everything for this, our families, any friends, our whole lives, though I suppose that we do get the ability to control time, and an arsenal of weapons.

But it’s a much harder life for the human race, people that otherwise have great potential, or an untapped intelligence, will simply collapse one day, any future ripped from them, the lucky ones are killed, the unlucky ones... well, they simply become husks, and that person becomes just another meal for the Slithers.

Honestly, if it weren’t for the fact that we’re on a pretty level playing field, the human race would have been wiped out aeons ago. "

So if you're someone who enjoys relaxing, sharing food, sitting and watching shows like Sherlock, or just going and out and exploring, then I would love to get to know you.

I hope to get to hear from you! And here's [me!](http://i.imgur.com/58jbg.jpg)"

Will this lead to a job?,throwawaythebelt,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/162dnf/unpaid_intern_hell_what_do_i_do_will_this_lead_to/,"I have a second interview at the county on Monday. My only issue is that the first time we spoke the director had said that there was a position under another director that had not been implemented yet, I would be getting my foot in the door, and I was in the right place at the right time. Both he and the assistant director of budget management really liked me. The assistant director even walked me to my car. However, he has made an appointment for me to meet with him again now on Monday with the Director that he was talking about as well. The catch is he asked me to bring a filled out copy of the counties internship application. I was not too keen on an unpaid internship, as this does not feed my family. What should I say? I am feeling like if I spurn the internship this ship may sail, but working free again seems like crap.

I have been down this internship road before and it ended in sadness. I cannot feed my family on a 0-dollar salary, but this is literally the only interest I have received since I started applying at the end of November. I have filled probably 100+++ applications in everything I can even remotely be qualified for. "

These are the course layouts for each college. If you have the time please look through some and tell me what you think. I would like to start CS in the next 6 months or even go to CC to get my math courses out of the way there.

I live in Massachusetts so Salem State and Fitchburg would have resident fees (lower tuition) so that is a plus.

Thanks, hopefully you guys can help me out. A redditor was talking to me on skype and explaining CS and what exactly goes on in the field. Once I talekd to him it gave me the motivation to actually go through with going to school for this. I was always put off by the large amount of math involved but I am willing to put in the effort to do what I want and hopefully study and work hard to get internships and so forth along the way. Thanks reddit for the help you have already given me.

If I messed up my formatting I will fix it, I am still new around here.

edit: I typed the formatting the same for the others for Fitch but it keeps coming out wrong :( Anyways for Fitchburg simply select Computer Science to get the layout for the course."

1625uf,6,2013-01-06,I'd like to share a story that's never told in any support group. A story of a false diagnosis with some detail attached.,[deleted],BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1625uf/id_like_to_share_a_story_thats_never_told_in_any/,"Pull up a chair.

I’ve been meaning to write this for a while. I used to be a regular here on an old account before I left the forum. I had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder type II for almost 4 years until I started questioning it. I was dead positive I had it. I mean, I experienced symptoms, could relate to those with the illness, went to psyche hospitals, had a psychiatrist, had therapists, went to a PHP and an IOP, basically the works. Last June, I even stated in a support group that I considered myself a severe case and symptoms have started emerging in childhood. It was all a false positive. I wish that sometime in the middle of it someone made a detailed account of a false diagnosis and what it was like going through it. It’s something that’s never told in support groups or forums or programs because anyone that got a false positive has moved on and left. So I guess I’ll be the one to tell the story. 

Around mid-July, I realized that no matter how much therapy and treatment I got, I still felt like shit. Always. Not so much at times, but a deep misery was always in the background. I started questioning whether these “treatments” were actually beneficial to me. By the end of the month, I realized that they were in fact crippling me further. Every doctor, therapist, counselor, patient, and institution has treated me like a psychiatric train wreck. I was convinced I was, and needed a new way of solving problems. 

Before going any further, it’s important to know several things about me. **1)** I have some pretty severe sleep issues and they’re measurable. They’ve been, for the last several years, the fuel of my diagnosis. I saw my pdoc in an effort to figure out these sleep issues (always feeling tired, hypersomnia – the sleep for 3 days kind, an unpredictable sleep schedule – travelling around the world through its time zones, and hyposomnia – 3 hours of sleep for 3 days was all my body could force itself to do leading me into being psychotically miserable and exhausted). These issues come and go and can’t be predicted. Sounds like a symptom of bipolar disorder, does it not? And **2)** I’ve had to overcome more than the average amount of hardships than the regular person. Enough said.

So things weren’t working. I was in college and forcing myself to do work. I was lonely for any sort of companionship. I wasn’t doing well in school. My GPA was shot (partly because of mental health and sleep reasons, partly because of my own fault). Before “the disorder hit” I was active in extracurriculars, ejoyed working, and even ran for president of my RHA first semester. Aside from some easy on campus jobs for 4 semesters, I’ve been doing nothing with my life since 2008 and I have pretty much nothing to show for it. Nothing special at all. Nothing measurable. Now I have a panel of people telling me how fucked up I am on top of everything else? Great. More crap to wipe up. 

The first thing I did was realize that I could go without my “panel of negativity” (Sure, most were trying to help. But in the end, none of them did). I cut myself off from any sort of talk therapy. The last thing I needed was someone telling me I had more problems which I don’t have. I decided that meds were something I still needed to take. I’ve had bad experiences with just about everything I was given, and nothing seemed to make much of a difference expect lithium (and what a difference that made without me realizing). So the plan was see an overworked pdoc once a month for 15 minutes to get myself a refill and be on my way. The rest was up to me. 

In the beginning of August, I dropped out of school instead of showing up to a final and decided my life was destroyed and I needed time to fix it. One thing was certain, I had some *fucked up* sleeping patterns. I’ve been to a psyche hospital 3 times. The first time in late 2011 was because I could almost never sleep. 6 hours every two days grew itself into a luxury. I was exhausted all the time, my memory was blown to shit, my perception of time was off, I became increasingly psychotic, and I wasn’t handling it well mentally (watching myself screw up in school by taking exams on 2 days of no sleep wasn’t fun, and when you just cannot physically fall asleep after trying so hard to it becomes physically painful – you can *feel* your frustration). They called it mania and it was off to the looney bin with me.

I stayed there for 2 weeks. Why 2 weeks? Because I tried to kill myself over the summer. Long story short, I got fired, got heartbroken, became a hermit, lost most of my friends due to isolating myself, and made a premeditated decision to kill myself. Wow. How depressing. I was running out of meds and didn’t want to spend the 50+ dollars to keep receiving them if I wasn’t going to be around by the end of the month. Literally, the day of my planned attempt I started feeling better and attributed it to mania after ceasing meds. So that was the topic of choice amongst my negativity panel for some time. 

Then there was my next lock up. My sleeping issues were once again ruining me, so I went back to the hospital under the name of depression. I stayed for 10 days, went to another PHP, etc. etc. The works. I was in this program doing summer classes, and I always seem to get depressed during the summer, so a PHP, some classes to keep me busy, and a med change was the best of what I could do at the time. I did get depressed pretty badly during last summer (the one which immediately following my second stay), and my sleep issues manifested themselves into something so uncontrollable. This is where I began sleeping for days on end. Sounded like depression to me, so let’s keep trying to treat that I thought. 

Then, adjoining with the beginning of the post, I went through a questioning period. One of my friends whom I met at the hospital first time around was going through the exact same phase. It was later where I would realize how important our friendship was in the course of changing events. 

So there I was, college dropout living back at home with recently divorced Mom and taking all the emotional abuse she had to offer. Not good. This led to my third hospitalization. I called an old counselor asking for a refill (didn’t have a pdoc at the time) and someone to talk to for a conversation on alternate housing. A few hours later, some cops and a screener show up to my house and told me they’re taking me to the ER. What the fuck. I went to a very violent hospital (the only one nearby), and no combination of words, actions, or calmness could convince them to let me stay home. Within a few days there most of the staff realized that I had no reason to really be there. The doctors kept me there for a week as a “precaution.” 

I left the place in early September and decided I’ve been betrayed, unintentionally harassed, and shat on by psychiatry. I had tens of thousands of dollars in student loans, hospital bills, and program bills and NOTHING to show for it. No improvement. It was then that I started asking the big question: Am I actually bipolar? My friend mentioned earlier was getting tossed about the system in the same manner as I was and had the same questions I had. It was then I started really breaking down and analyzing what I thought and was told were symptoms. Let’s break it down.

Sleep. The easiest to measure. I had always thought of my sleep issues as post-mental illness. The plan was to go to doctors and sleep specialists and get a real diagnosis from that (and get tossed around and fed shit from THAT system as well until I received some real help). I was pretty depressed when I went to the hospital the second time, no doubt about that. But wait. Let’s look at the formal and recognized definition of mental illness for a second…

*1) A mental illness is a result of internal dysfunction.*

*2) A mental illness must prove to have severe impairment.*

*3) A mental illness cannot be from the result of external stimuli.*

The reason I was depressed was because I just watched myself get destroyed by school due to my sleep patterns, laziness, and tendencies to be late for everything. Actually, come think of it, it’s always been a similar story to that. My sleep issues came before any sort of “symptoms” emerging from them. It breaks rule 3. I had an app where you could monitor your mood (I posted it on her once) and I used it to track not only mood, but amount of sleep I got. There was a pattern. I would alternate between a high and low amount of sleep (15 hours day 1, 11 hours day 2, 14 hours day 3, 10 hours day 4, etc.) My mood followed the pattern almost perfectly, and that *makes sense*. It would make sense to be in a bad mood when your body gets less sleep than it’s used to. Sleep issues, the backbone of my diagnosis had to be taken off the list.

“Fearchosis.” Yeah, I made up that word. Since around March I’ve been experiencing rare instances where things just get “weird and scary” for a while. The best way I can describe it is taking an infinite list of *everything* you know (how to turn on the shower, where you live and how you got there, your friend Cindy and who she is) and trying to read it back to yourself while you realize that nothing on it actually makes clear sense to you. I call it fearchosis because it’s scary when that happens, sort of like a panic attack without an elevated heartbeat or sweat. I *guess* it can be similar to psychosis, as that’s what doctors called it (/whatever other symptom they can’t explain), but I didn’t actually leave my basis of reality. I was firmly grounded in it actually. It just became unfamiliar in a sort of “HOW THE FUCK DID I GET HERE?” kind of question you ask yourself when you’re 38, married, and with children in a new state. But alas! A pattern emerged. These would only happen if I missed sleep either the night before or the night before that. It never happened any other time. Since it breaks rule 3, this one’s also off the list.

Racing thoughts. I used to get these occasionally at random. It seemed to satisfy all 3 rules, so maybe there’s something to my diagnosis. After all, let’s be careful before abandoning medications and therapy. The first time I was in the hospital, I was given abilify. I was forced to take it same time every day. Towards the end of my stay, from around 1:30 – 5:00 PM, I experienced a quick manic depressive cycle, something new to me (should have noticed that…). I was a little bit too cheerful for an asylum and then at the exact same time I began feeling like shit. The meds were screwing with my emotions and moods. I stopped taking abilify because of the side effects immediately after discharge, and when it left my system the side effects and mood swings were gone and I was back to just being depressed all the time (should have noticed that…#2). The thought that my meds were affecting my mood negatively didn’t really daunt me until a few months ago. When I was analyzing my symptoms, I put this one “on hold” in the event of a possibility that I have a more mild case of bipolar disorder. 

Anger. I almost never lose my shit, or at least not visually. When one of my roommates found out about my diagnosis, he had a hard time believing it because he’d never seen me angry. Despite my ability to keep calm in stressful situations, I do get angry like everyone else, but I can’t recall a time where anger was inappropriate. I mean, I saw a man get pushed and beaten into a wall right behind me in my third stay at a ward because a stranger brushed shoulders with him as he passed by. I don’t get that. So by rules 1 and 2, that symptom’s off the list as well. 

Drug abuse. Yeah, I do that. But it isn’t constant. There were only a small handful of times I’ve gotten drunk/tipsy alone (a few times when I was coming home from working two jobs 60 hours a week, and once when I got depressed before my second hospital stay). I did drink a lot my senior year of college, and no doubt that affected other things too, but it was always with company and rarely to escape. I have used drugs as escape routes before, but hey, so did Private Joe when his friend in ‘Nam was burned to death and he wasn’t bipolar. Other than tobacco, I’ve never developed an addiction. I go on binges and then when my supply runs out I don’t bother with getting more. I stopped using any sort of narcotics since around March unless they were prescribed for legitimate medical reasons (a few close calls for addiction, but I worked through it each time). Looking back, though I did a LOT of experimenting, and that seems to be all it was. I rarely did a drug more than once or twice and then go on to trying something else. I guess I was just curious, and sometimes I needed a break from things. Breaks all 3 rules.

Mania. The euphoria of mania can be very difficult to accurately diagnose. There are times where I notice myself talking faster, where I get more cheerful and excited for little reason, etc. I went by the typical “journalistic” definition (the “OMG, I think I might have that” definition). As I heard account and stories from and of those were had a clear cut mania episode, I began realizing that I couldn’t relate. All of those stories were much more severe and stranger than mine. I act like an ass sometimes when I’m excited, but I’ve never lost friendships, got myself into debt, engaged in strange erotic behavior, hurt anyone, make any important impulsive decisions, or ANY of that. I do get lost usually, but hey, so does my Mom. Maybe I just don’t pay attention and suck at coordinates? Even then, not a big deal. I did get what I thought were manic episodes, but I also got those when abilify came into the picture. Either it was cancelling out my other meds or causing the problem completely. I never got manic for more than a full day. There was one time, which doctors and I used as a measure of my mania severity, in which I impulsively bought a 550 dollar guitar when I was “just browsing.” The thing is, though, it was a really nice guitar and I’m a musician. I touch it almost every day, and I paid for it in cash. As in, I didn’t use credit, I didn’t go into debt, it was something I could afford, I didn’t take the money away from anything else, and I don’t regret the purchase. It seems like all 3 rules were broken with this one. The more I learned about what true mania was in detail, the more I realized I’ve never experienced anything like it.

Depression. It’s so, so, so difficult to accurately measure depression. I mean, my Mom was having financial issues and going through a horrible divorce when she decided to make a stop at as pdoc. The guy just GAVE her benzos and SSRIs on her first visit as if she had a clear cut mental illness (for those curious, the antidepressants ended up not working (well, duh. It was made for a neurological disorder) and the benzos became “Mother’s Little Helper”). A massive point often ignored by pdocs and patients alike: **There is a difference in feeling depressed and being unhappy.** I was pretty unhappy, and to a high degree I still am. But hey, I’m a college dropout who left behind a shitty GPA, I live at home with an emotionally draining Mother, I have no girlfriend / much experience with them, no job, no internship experience, no volunteer work, most of my friends were lost from isolation graduation and moving from place to place, my dad hates our family and left one day without saying goodbye, I have no figures to look up to, I’m in physical pain almost every day, and I’ve done basically jack shit for the last 5 years of my life. I‘ve done nothing special with myself, nothing I can call an achievement. I have hobbies, but those are just hobbies. I was always timid and lazy to meet new people and join clubs at school, and my schedule was always packed with shit to do to the point where I was always busy catching up on or procrastinating schoolwork. I made excuses. LOTS of them. This is a “symptom” I couldn’t ignore, but at the same time, there was always a reason for it, and depression always happened after this reason. It broke rule 3 pretty hard. 

So there. My psychiatric profile in a nutshell. Aside from racing thoughts, and a few more minor issues not mentioned, it seems like things are pointing towards a misdiagnosis. Time to do something about it. Time to answer my questions through experiment rather than by just pondering. Let’s go back to the system, explain myself, and then promptly get SHAT ON by it.

**If there’s one lesson to be learned from all of this and from this entire post, it’s this. The practice of psychiatry is inefficient.** I could say it’s a joke, but I can’t forget the people who actually do have mental illnesses that are receiving treatment the best ways that are practical. But it’s undeniable that a rather significant portion of mental patients are mis/overdiagnosed. The system is set-up in a way that this just happens naturally, even with the “good docs.” The DSM wasn’t always the way it is now (a list of disorders and their symptoms). It used to be organized free writing of mental disorders. This approach was back when talk therapy was popular (~1920s). Patients would see a therapist and talk things out before jumping to conclusions. Breakthroughs sometimes took months, the process took a long time, and it could be a while before a diagnosis was declared – if any (well, those are some rare words). Psychology was *as it should be*. Doctors were actually careful and focused on accuracy before just slapping a label on. Currently, with the way our modern system is set up, you need insurance to approve your help before you get it. You go into a new doctor’s office, have only a 30-50 minute interview with a doctor, and he’s supposed to decide whether you have a lifelong condition before lunch. Why are there multiple steps in getting major surgery but only one for getting a lifelong psychiatric diagnosis? 

Everyone here has seen the criteria they use to judge you with. You get a form. On it, there are about 12-15 vague and generalized questions like “do you have racing thoughts often?” How often is often? Like, every day, once a week,  what? Well, what exactly are racing thoughts? Do they mean thinking of all the things you have to do before the day ends on your commute from work and stressing out? Not really. It’s more like having a thought cloud containing fragmented bits of sentences, concepts, and ideas where your stream of consciousness is physically much faster as you try to grab these thoughts. I never experienced that, but that’s how clear cut patients describe it. I thought I had racing thoughts, but it was really just the former idea. Why was NONE OF THIS explained to me? I even asked questions like this during interviews with new pdocs, and I was just told “don’t think about it too deeply, just answer honestly.” No. Fuck that. If this sheet of paper is what determines my diagnosis, then I want to know what every question means. I’m basically diagnosing myself here. It’s your job to oversee that I do it correctly, not just give automatic confirmation. 

And automatic confirmation is what it pretty much is. If someone goes to a psychiatrist, then they think something’s wrong with them / looking for speed and valium, right? That doctor could get a nasty lawsuit if he just said you were ok and let you go if you wound up killing yourself a week later. So he writes *some* diagnosis down and plans to explore it later. I’m told by staff at a mental ward that a bipolar diagnosis is what’s given if a doctor really can’t figure out what’s wrong with a patient and has about an hour to make the decision. It’s an easy diagnosis since it covers basically the whole spectrum of moods. If someone selects the correct words and actions, anyone can get a bipolar diagnosis. I know this from trying to change it. The doctor will mostly likely give you a prescription (if it isn’t narcotic), hand you a pamphlet on it if you bug him enough, and send you on your way. But hey, the doctor did write down his opinions and you’ll get more visits later so you should have a chance to really look over your diagnosis before making a confirmation like that, right? In practice, this isn’t what happens. Doctors are so swamped with patients that some only see them for 15 minutes. They don’t know you.  Period. The second time you’ll see time, they’ll barely remember you if at all, so they pull up your charts and see “Bipolar Disorder” along with your Seroquel prescription and just start talking about how the meds are working for you instead of really debunking your hasty diagnosis. There’s a lot of precaution that goes into liability of a mental patient (taking them in, not releasing them too early at wards, making sure they keep getting prescribed medication, etc.), but hardly ANY of the precaution goes into the accuracy of a diagnosis itself. This is an invisible, permanent illness here, and the drugs which are expected to be taken throughout a whole lifetime have a massive list of unhealthy side effects. This isn’t a decision a doctor can make in a 30 minute interview.

It’s easy to be misinformed and work your way towards a prescription whilst being completely honest. Surveys have been taken to determine how much of the population is mentally ill, and they all fall flat on their faces because they’re just not reliable. A patient / survey taker is expected to answer very general questions on a topic they know little to nothing about. In my case, I heard “impulsive spending” in a description of mania and stated my guitar as evidence even though it wasn’t the result of mania at all. There’s just no detail anywhere. “Do you feel down lately?” What a completely subjective question. I bet I’d answer it much differently if my fiancée left me at the alter last week compared to if I just got promoted to a six figure salary. Mental illnesses are basically self-diagnosing and going to the office of someone with an MD. Even those who make the informal diagnoses are uneducated. If your son’s teacher tells you that she thinks your kid has ADHD, guess what they based that off of. The DSM? Academic journals? Chances are, their knowledge of ADHD was based entirely on conversations with other teachers in the break room. There was a HUGE spike in diagnosis in the mid-90s because that’s when pill manufactures realized they’d get a lot more customers if they advertised directly to the consumer instead of just the doctors handling this stuff. Your diagnosis today is what information you choose to reveal about yourself in a 40 minute interview. People are expected to make critical choices when they don’t have the education to make them. Stating the obvious, the mood you were in the office affects your diagnosis severely. Hell, the doctors are “trained” to look for subtle hints not just at interviews but subsequent visits. Drinking coffee &gt; fidgeting ledge = mania. Staying up late to finish paper  &gt; exhaustion from sleep deprivation = depression.  Coming to my last criticism of the diagnosis process, the whole practice of psychiatry is just a big, grey, hairy catch 22. 

It’s an endless loop in a game you can’t win. I can’t tell you the amount of times I’ve been given a new prescription based solely on the fact that I happen to be talking fast in the office or something equally as trivial. What exactly is the proper “doctor’s office etiquette?” How can you best assure that your follow ups are judged neutrally? Do I act more energetic when I’m in a good mood and risk mania talk or do I stay emotionless and bland and risk being called depressed? I don’t know. There’s no way I can compile all of my feelings, emotions, and thoughts of the past month in a single 30 minute session. Instead, the same questions get asked to get me my refill (Voices in your head? Feel like hurting yourself or others? “How’s your mood?”) and new ones are added based on how I present myself at THAT particular time. The deeper I went into the field, the more confident I became that I was a severe case and knew symptoms well. Yes, I did keep track of my behaviors and emotions pretty closely, but I was systematically wrong in what was actually a real “symptom.” This led to doctors trusting my word instead of questioning it. But if I firmly stated “this is not a symptom,” there would be a disagreement. That hospital on my third stay kept claiming I was severely depressed, but they were neglecting rule 3. I told them of how my life was genuinely shitty without any sort of mood disorder on top of it, but it was still labeled a symptom. I first mentioned my guitar purchase years ago to my long term pdoc. How come no one ever asked if it impaired me or even if I was a musician? Why were these questions ignored? Are psychiatrists really just prescription machines? Put yourself in my situation. You’ve been through the mental health system in full. You left a long track record of the places you’ve been to, the doctor’s you’ve seen, and the symptoms you claimed to have. You weren’t given the chance to amend your charts. You were brainwashed, lied to, and not given information. You fueled your own diagnosis. Years have passed. You are now educated and as time goes on you’re finding natural causes for your problems and natural, yet simple, solutions to them and they work. You’ve realized that everyone, including yourself, was just incorrect and you’re largely to blame. Maybe you’re just fucked up, but psychiatric medication isn’t going to fix that. You’ve left behind you a whole crowd full of friends, family, professionals, and strangers with a firm understanding that your problems are not like theirs, that your loneliness is different than whatever they experience. They know you’re different, that you’re not like them. You need special care. Locking you in an asylum would do you good. You’re a psychiatric train wreck, and everyone knows it. 

How do you tell them you were wrong?

Currently, I’ve been seeing sleep specialists and one of which has finally been able to help me. It’s a slow process. The visits are often months apart at minimum, so I wish I was getting more proactive attention. I’m believed to have a free running circadian rhythm (explains the time zone thing), sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome (explains sleeping too much and always feeling tired). I’m given tools to accurately measure it. There’s a chance I might have insomnia, but the doctor is telling me we should first fix the free running sleeping times before we make that conclusion. In about a month or so, I’ll have my own CPAP machine, sunlamp, and muscle relaxers. Sleep is by far my biggest impairment. It’s nice to see it finally getting proper treatment.

I’ve been dabbling around volunteer work recently. I sent some emails to organizations and a few have replied saying that they’re able to work around my sleeping patterns until they’re fixed. I’m excited. I get to go out of the house on a regular basis, meet some new people, build a resume, contribute to society, and get to know myself a LOT better. I was browsing through some descriptions of opportunities and it really made me realize I know little about myself. *Could I* cheer someone up who’s terminally ill? Can I handle that person’s death? So many questions about myself. I think getting to know myself better will help in my self-esteem and confidence. I’m definitely not ready to work yet, though. I mean, it’s 6am right now and I still haven’t slept and this is all too normal for me.

Taking so much time off from school and responsibilities has given me some much needed time for some soul searching. I feel like I’m at the beginning of a self-improvement success story. I’ve realized it’s time that I need to stop hiding behind some bipolar shield of excuses and accept that I have much more control over my life than I thought. I stopped taking medication completely mid-October. I was on my own for it because no doctor wanted the liability, so I watched myself over like a hawk. My friend which I mentioned earlier was going through the same motions. He wanted to kill himself but couldn’t do it, so he figured if he stopped taking his medications he could have the courage to do it. He stopped taking them, and a week later, he didn’t feel like shit anymore. He stopped feeling suicidal after his meds left his system. My suicide attempt parallels his. I just don’t know why I couldn’t make the correlation at the time. When I stopped taking lithium, I was pretty scared, to be honest. I didn’t know what would happen. I knew that mania will come after a med cease, and I wanted to measure how bad it would get. I’ve been on medication for years. There’s no telling how hard this would hit. The big surprise? It never did. I didn’t get horribly out of control without them. I didn’t even get a *little* out of control without them. It was one of the biggest (and most pleasant) shocks of my life. I’m still in a bad life situation, and my sleep is still an issue; so feelings like loneliness or exhaustion are still there, but they get passed through a sort of filter. I feel lonely because I spent months on okcupid and put many hours into it with just one date with a weird chick as payoff, not because my life is a big heap of loneliness and no one understands me. That’s how I think now. And you know what? I feel fine. But it’s a different kind of “fine.” It’s not the kind of fine you tell your therapist that really means, “I feel like shit, but I can deal with it.” Most importantly, I don’t feel “too fine.” My feelings and moods are appropriately matched. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to experience and react to things on a 1:1 ratio and take in things for what they are. When I’m angry, there’s a reason for it. When I’m smiling and laughing, there’s a reason for that too. I’m free from this veil that medication has put over me, and it feels pretty…nice. I do have times where my day doesn’t go too well. If I meet up with a friend of mine who just got accepted into a good graduate program, it’s kind of difficult not feeling like shit in comparison. However, this “depression cloud” which I had my entire time at college / my entire time on medication is gone. It’s hard to describe, but I can see it in the sense that I don’t have bad days where I can’t get out of bed and I don’t feel miserable when my friends and I are out having fun. I didn’t feel miserable ALL the time on medication, but there was a feeling of just “feeling crappy” I was never able to shake. I’d walk home from class and just think of how miserable my life was, but now it doesn’t happen anymore and I don’t enter these perpetual negative thinking sequences. When I’m in the shower, I think of season 2 of Dexter which I just watched or video Alex took of me at the bar instead of things like “Why does my life have to be so damn tough to live?”

Apologies in advance to people who have faith, but I was raised Roman Catholic. I was a true believer in God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit. I felt like I was talking to someone when my hands were folded and I was sitting in a dark, silent room. I made it through my communion and confirmation until one day I just questioned religion out of the blue and realized it was all just *made up*. I went to church all those times, I gave all those donations, I had the proper ceremonies, I went to CCD for years, I revolved my entire life philosophy and everything I thought and did around this faith. Then I realized I was wrong, and all of that was for nothing, just a waste of my time making my life more complicated than it should be. Realizing I’m not bipolar has brought on these EXACT feelings. It’s like finishing a chapter of my life and realizing it wasn’t part of the curriculum. 

I’ve bashed the mental health system enough for one night, but I have PLENTY more where that came from. All that was just about being diagnosed as bipolar. Now, let’s be real here. Mental illnesses are real. People are bipolar. People do have MDD. People are schizophrenic. There’s no denial of that. Aside from lack of funding for programs and care centers, I say that those with a mental illness have a pretty good chance of finding and getting help. Mental health care has plenty of faults, though. The system is set up to treat every patient (as long as they can pay for it), but there’s no real filter for saying who’s a patient and who isn’t. Either that, or some filter does exist and it’s being ignored, hence all the Adderall floating around campuses. My main point out of all of this is that psychiatric treatment is inefficient; it overdiagnosis…a lot, and there aren’t safety nets in place to sort that out.

Hopefully, someone is touched by my story and gets encouraged to start asking questions, too. But if not, I’m content with the whole thing just being food for thought. I gained a self of closure writing all this up, anyway. I’m taking a risk putting this up here. I don’t care about whether it blows my identity, but I do care about being discredited and pulled back down by the hands of anonymous internet strangers. Yeah, this is 9 pages on MS word single spaced, but it isn’t the full story. I left a lot out because I’m not going to make anyone read a novel, as long as this already is. If you want to give me advice, I’d like some on how to clear my name and make my diagnosis void. I only tried to do that once and it ended by a nurse and a doctor kicking me out of the office as soon as they heard I wasn’t there for medication (they knew nothing else about me other than what I study in school and that I have “some sleeping issues,” so it’s not like they heard any part of my story). How do I complete this process?  I feel like if any sort of symptoms are eventually taken care of and disappear then I won’t have anything to prove it. Sure, my charts were essentially just my word, but people trust doctors’ charts. How do I stack up against that with just my word to go on? I met a man in his 40s on my third trip to the ward and he told me that he had a mental illness (didn’t say) already diagnosed and when he presented divorce papers to his wife, she called the police 2 days later saying that she was afraid of him because “he’s been violent lately” and they threw the guy in there and interrupted his life (and probably made him lose his job) over a precaution. I don’t want that to happen to me.

So nothing resembling a mental illness has showed itself for months now, and my sleep issues which have been the strongest support of my diagnosis have found different reasons for existing other than bipolar disorder and treatments look promising. I know someone out there will try to discredit me by just skimming around my story and tell me I should go right back on medication and start seeing a doctor just because it’s the “safe thing to do.” I know exactly what the comment will say, too. It’s going to be a catch 22 statement, but it really just demonstrates my earlier criticisms of the diagnosis process. That sentence is one I’ve heard many times before and has stopped me from cancelling treatment to look for the answers myself. It’s a “Gotcha!” sentence. Sort of like, “What if it was your mother who was the one that…” where there’s really no way out of it, and my experience was filled hearing similar things. It’s: *“Just because you feel fine now, doesn’t mean you will continue to feel fine. Sometimes symptoms of mental illness take months or even years before they start emerging again.”*

I am very pleased and am happy to start my new position, however my pay rate has me a bit bummed.  The place I work for is a state agency, and therefore has some pretty awesome benefits.  I was an intern at this agency before I was hired and because of the different departments I worked in I got to see the previous salary of the person who had my job. She retired in December, and was previously an RN before she took the position at the agency 8 years ago.  I saw that her salary was around $54,000.  I did not expect to make that much considering my Degree is in Public Health and the only other job I have had was an $8.50 hr position. Even though I knew I would make what she made right off of the bat, I was a bit surprised that they are starting me out at $36,580 yearly. The benefits included in the job include free health insurance, state retirement benefits which I do not have to pay anything for, and life insurance that I do not have to pay for.  The life insurance is for $12,000 dollars, and the health insurance has a 250 dollar deductible with prescriptions medications at a 10, 25, 60 scale.  

I guess my question is, how much are these benefits worth if you were to assign a monetary value to them? I am really not sure how to even start figuring out how much my benefits are worth. 


EDIT:  I got to sit down yesterday and discuss my benefits at work.  I'm feeling a lot better about my pay and my benefits.  I'm in the first level of a tiered position, which is to be expected with my level of experience.  Every year they do 1 to 2% raises for cost of living and I am eligible for a merit boost to the next level of my tier which will give me a raise of 5%.  Knowing this has eased my mind somewhat.

As for my benefits, I was a bit off with my life insurance amount,  It is equal to my salary.  I also get short and long term disability, which means if i get hurt on or off the job I get 70% of my pay while getting better.  The retirement benefits are state benefits that I do not have to contribute to, so again that is a plus.  

Overall, I think I can live with the job offer and even be happy about it.  Thank you to everyone who commented!  You helped me to ask the right questions while discussing everything!

Any help would be appreciated!  "

The companies i had in mind were: Tesla, SpaceX,  GM, Ford, Boeing, and GE Energy. 

I would really like to stay on the design side of things, particularly the automotive field because of my experience with carbon fiber and that i really like cars, but the pay at tesla would barely cover rent and expenses in palo alto, while i could stay at home if i worked at Ford or GM. However, i worry that the work there isn't as intensive or useful as the 60 hour work weeks at Tesla. 

I mentioned SpaceX, Boeing, and GE Energy because there is still a lot of work there in design particularly with structures and carbon fiber.

I'm open to oil and military as well, but it's not high on my list. Do you guys have any suggestions or advice? I'm open to others firms as well

161q95,11,2013-01-06,"23 years old, started a new ""dream"" job recently at a very small company after 1.5 years of trying. Part of me is worried that I might blow it.",joddaboy,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/161q95/23_years_old_started_a_new_dream_job_recently_at/,"I should start off by saying that one of my major insecurities is that I'm not smart enough. I'm well educated and went to a very good college, though I didn't work hard enough and earned only a 2.9 GPA. Definitely one of my biggest regrets in life, though to be honest, I don't really believe that if I was to be thrust back into college, I'd work that much harder. I do, however, work pretty damn hard for my job (I have to, because there's so much to learn since I'm new, plus lots of work). I'm super interested and passionate about lots of things: science, tech, politics, green energy. And I can talk all day about them. I'm not the most organized though I'm working on it, and I don't think I'm very creative.


Technically it's a paid internship as an energy auditor in Boston. Basically going through buildings, looking at all the HVAC systems, lighting, etc and writing a report on how they can save the building 20%+ energy. 

I've always been interested in this type of stuff, but I've never done anything nearly so technical, as the job forces me to gain a comprehensive understanding of nearly every aspect of building systems. There's just so much to learn and I've frankly never worked this hard. I find I'm pretty well able to wrap my head around things. My memory's not so great, so I sometimes need to be told things twice or perhaps I ask the same question twice over a two week period, not a huge deal I don't think but worth noting. 

Now the deal when they offered me the internship was one month part time paid, one month full time paid, and then if everything goes well, fulltime job. It's been a little over a month. We lack an office (they're looking for one pretty seriously but it could be weeks) so we work from a temporary office once a week and from home otherwise. This makes it a little tougher because things are somewhat strained due to it being harder for my bosses to manage me, but also since I can't just walk over to one of their desks and ask a question. 

I spoke to my boss yesterday, and he basically said, ""well, since we don't have an office yet, it's too hard for me to manage you and other employee John remotely so let's wait until we have an office before going fulltime internship, and then around two months from then, (and I quote) it'll turn into a fulltime position."" 
He said he wanted me to be fully trained before offering me the job. I'm worried that he's having doubts, at least enough to want to try me out for longer. Or maybe he's just sort of flakey? (I can sort of see how he might be for other reasons, but it could be in my head). He's investing a lot of time and effort training me, and the company is financially investing in me as well. (Or do they just see it as ""he does the work, if he doesn't work out, we let him go, no biggie? Other side to this argument is all the time he's putting into training me...) 

Something I've really been trying to get better about is not making little mistakes, and when I do and they ""call me out"" on them, I'm like shit they're going to turn sour on me. 

Then again, people make mistakes right? How perfect do employers expect their employees to be? Back when I interviewed, my boss said he was looking for smart people. A little voice in my head said ""Hopefully I'm smart enough"" and since then I've had my doubts when I make mistakes, and yesterday after the conversation with my boss. I'm doing my best to just power through and work as hard as I can. I know this won't accomplish anything and only satisfy me, but should I ask my boss if there's anything I could be doing better? I mean I know the mistakes I'm making and learning from them, so I'm thinking probably not and that I should just push on, work my ass off and I'll be fine.

I'm entering the second semester of my junior year as a ChemE. I am behind in 2 freshman/sophomore classes (Physics 2 and Organic Chem lab), but they shouldn't keep me back a year... hopefully. I'm planning to take Physics 2 over the summer, and I took a Biology major OChem lab that should cover my majors Orgo lab.

In addition, I have a minor in Biology. I want to keep the minor, I really enjoy biology and am very interested in biological engineering, and biological applications for nanotechnology (which is my concentration in ChemE). You need to take 6 classes to do this, and I've taken 3 so far. 2 of my 3 remaining would need a lab in addition, and be at the 300 level.

I don't know how I can fit this into my schedule, as I have 15 credits so far this semester (including a graduate nano class that I want to take that's for my nano concentration). I tried biochem last fall but ended up withdrawing. I could look to see if over the summer at Umass Boston or another state college I could take some of the bio classes, but I already transferred in 60+ credits from community college and might be at my limit? (I know guidance would be better suited for asking this question). I'm enrolled in Biochem (giving me 18 credits), but I'm wary of taking that many credits, also seeing it would interfere with my internship that I value greatly (I would be able to comfortably work 10 hours a week without Biochem, only 6 hours with it and with a chaotic schedule).

What do you guys and gals think? Keep trying with my minor and take Biochem this semester, or avoid the question for now and maybe reevaluate over the summer?"

I'm starting a full-time, paid, 6-month internship on January 22. I will be pretty broke until I get my first pay cheque, so I am looking for roommates starting February 1 or possibly later.

I plan on staying in NYC after this 6 month internship is up (either this will become a permanent job, or I'll find a permanent job elsewhere), so I could potentially sign onto a place for longer than 6 months. Since I'm coming from out of town (out of country, really), I'd prefer a sublet in which I don't have to sign onto a lease from the get-go because I don't know that I'll have all the necessary paperwork, e.g. tax returns, pay stubs, etc., right away.

I'm flexible, down-to-earth and easy to get along with. I've been living with my boyfriend for almost 4 years and we're staying together (he's supposed to be moving to NYC as well in the fall), so I'm not going to be bringing strange people home or anything, and I'm used to hanging around guys. I'm all right living with any gender or sexual orientation and am 100% LGBT-friendly. I'm used to living in the big city and I have been to NYC before and love it there, so I'm not coming with a super naïve romanticized idea of what New York is. I work as a writer/editor/music journalist, love playing video games from time to time, I enjoy practicing yoga (which I mostly do outside of the home) and I speak French! So, there's a pretty good intro to what I'm all about.

Please send me a PM if you can help me out. Thanks! :D"

1658pi,2,2013-01-07,"I (23M) have been talking to a girl (21F), who I believe is way more excited.",throwaway15536,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1658pi/i_23m_have_been_talking_to_a_girl_21f_who_i/,"**tl;dr** I bit the bullet and signed up for a dating site last week. This resulted in a ""match"" within 24 hours and we have been talking for 4 days or so now. Now she seems *really* excited whenever we talk again which is making me feel ... pressured.

Longer version: I graduated college in July, aged 22 and with only one (long distance, internet only) relationship under my belt. Feeling lost it took me 5 months to find a job. At the end of December I got my first paycheck and the feeling of financial freedom has lifted some constraints in my life.

I studied Physics in college, when hanging with friends there's no single women and during my internships at hospitals girls my age were even getting married. This didn't bother me, I had my own things to deal with. Last week I realized that I don't meet a lot of women and decided to sign up for a (free, I'm still student cheap) dating website.

Within hours I was met with my first match and decided to talk to her. My first intentions were to just talk to whoever came up, see if we got along. That's seems reasonable because I have basically zero idea of what I'm doing. I'm not in a rush.

The girl I met is 21 and immediately started with a question, asking if I was more attracted to personality or appearance and if I would object to people with a disability. 

She has spina bifida and is in a wheelchair. This didn't seem to be a problem (personality wise) and we started talking. I enjoy finding out things about people and if people mention ""it's a long story"" they better expect me to ask more. 

She meets a lot of guys who are instantly turned off by the wheelchair. Her mother has cancer and has basically been given up. I was the first person in ages who didn't immediately get turned off by her telling a lot of personal things. She has been having trouble finding a job. She doesn't have many friends who feel confident going outside with her.

I most certainly understand some of her problems and don't mind talking about these subjects at all. Life deals shitty hands and talking about it is only natural. This doesn't phase me and the more serious conversations is something I enjoy.

However, this was still less than 36 hours since I got my notification. She seems really excited whenever we talk and when she has to leave. I enjoy talking to her of course or I wouldn't do it, but this whole thing feels overwelming. 

I have told her my plan was just to talk to whoever came up for one or two weeks first before deciding what to do.

Is this the most absurd idea of ""she must be so into me!""? Am I an asshole for feeling completely overwhelmed? I am so inexperienced with  all this... Could really use some insight here.

Edit: I get the feeling she's very strong and is confident enough to know what she wants. All the shit you would get while being in a wheelchair would certainly help with that. This would be the opposite of what I am at the moment. I only recently made some long term goals for myself."

I'm a college student looking for a business to do a co-op (more or less a paid internship, for my purposes) with this summer, and I'd really like to go to Nashville.

I'm a packaging science major (I know, it's weird), which means my options are pretty open. Most companies that exist have some kind of packaging-related department. I could help with packaging for sheet music, instruments, accessories, CDs. A lot of companies that don't have products that you would envision in a box on a shelf but have an online store still need a packaging department to ship stuff out to customers.

It doesn't have to be a music company, but part of the reason I want to go to Nashville is that I would like to do something that makes my music minor (jazz piano) relevant. My professor even said if we could set up a job where I was working for a packaging company composing music for videos of their machinery they put on their website, it would count for the co-op.

Right now, I'm just making a list of companies so my professor and I can start sending out some feeler e-mails, so if you know of any music and/or packaging related companies that sound good for what I'm doing, I would really appreciate the help! THANKS!"

You all have given me amazing advice in the past, so I wanted to hear your honest-to-goodness advice and experience on long distance relationships. Here's my situation: I just entered a relationship a few months ago with an AMAZING guy. He is very much becoming 'my other half' and we both see the relationship getting very serious, possibly leading into marriage some day. We're both in our last year of college, about to graduate and our lives are very much in a stage of uncertainty; where will we live, what jobs will we have, grad schools, etc. I know we are both very young and it seems foolish to attempt a serious relationship like this at such an uncertain point in our lives, but as I said, we both feel really strongly about this and are willing to make it work for the long-haul.

So, three months into our relationship, I had to move away to a new city for an internship, and I won't be seeing him (except for a couple weekends here and there), for 4 months. Because I knew I would be moving for these 4 months we talked long and hard about whether it was even smart to continue the relationship given the fact that I would be gone, and then a mere 4 months after that we'd both be graduating. Ultimately, we decided that we cared about each other too much and wanted to see where things can go.

So ladies, I wanted to hear your experiences, good and bad, of LDRs, and what advice you may have. Is it worth sticking it out, when ultimately we might be moving to opposite sides of the country to start our careers? Is the heart break of being apart worth the reward of being with an amazing guy? ADVICE PLEASE! 

TL;DR Just entered a relationship with possibly 'the one,' when I know it's very likely we won't be living in the same city for a long period of time, HALP."

I abhor debt, and would like to graduate college debt-free, but I have no idea how to manage the money I'm planning to spend come fall of 2014.

My scholarship and parents are only paying through four years, so the last semester will be on my dime. Tuition is currently just under $10,000/semester, and room and board at my fraternity is around $3,300/semester. Allowing for tuition increases, I anticipate a $14,500 expense in two years.

I currently have $2,500 in the bank (no investments or debt), and I made around $5500 at my internship this past summer (after taxes, before return). I hope to have at least the same level of income over the next two summers, even if it means picking up a second job.  I'm currently looking into things like selling plasma to generate some extra money (other ideas are welcome).

We both lived with our parents who live 45 minutes apart. We just saw each other on weekends, until I moved to the south (we're from Massachusetts) for four months to complete an internship. The past couple of years I've been waiting for him to graduate, which he did last year. Now we live together but I travel for work which brings me home for only 10 days a month maximum. 

Now that everything else in our relationship has lined up and things are getting better, our bedroom issue is now front and center as this big problem that we need to overcome. My boyfriend has always been, shall I say, less enthusiastic about sex. It doesn't take much to get him off. A bj and some body rubbing usually do the trick. I guess I'm more traditional, in the sense I'd like to try the top and bottom dynamic and it takes a little more effort to get me off. We never experimented when we lived with our parents because I don't think we were comfortable trying that under our parents' roofs. Now that we live together, I'd like to try more things. But he is completely turned off by it. The mere suggestion of him topping me is a boner killer for him (can't stand the thought of him getting shit on his dick, no matter how many times I tell him that I can douche and try and minimize the problem for him). I know I can't make him be more comfortable, and I can try to forget about topping and bottoming, it's his complete lack of sex drive that worries me the most. I worry that the problem may be more medical than expected. I've wondered if he is just a little asexual, or if he is low on testosterone and therefore doesn't have the sex drive I do. 

I'll admit, it doesn't take much to get me going. But I feel like I have to coerce him every time, and I feel like I force him into it, even just doing the little things that get him off. Then I feel terrible. It gives me less confidence because I feel like I'm not attractive enough to him to get him going. And because he has a hard time satisfying me, he has no confidence in himself and he doesn't do a lot of things I tell him will satisfy me. His gag reflex is terrible, and I've never had a proper blowjob. He almost throws up every time he brushes his teeth. He says he's tried methods to improve his reflex, but they haven't been working. His lack of confidence is so bad, it's getting to the point where he doesn't want to have sex with me at all because it just makes him feel like shit. 

I love this man with all of my heart, and I know he feels the same way about me, but we're having such a hard time expressing that love physically. It's become such a frustrating subject for us and we've had multiple fights because of it. We had one big fight in October where he didn't speak to me for a week. We talked it out and put it behind us. By the time Christmas came around, I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him because I know we can work out any problems that we have. I asked him to marry me and he turned me down. He was really shaken by the last fight we had, which I understand. I then started to have my own doubts and worries about the relationship and I got really scared and upset that we aren't working as a couple. Which then led to two more fights the last two nights. We're not on bad terms but there was a lot of baggage that we've been holding on to that needed to get out in the open. We realized that any other doubts and concerns we have all boil down to our intimacy issue. 

And now here we are. Have any of you bros had experience with an issue like this? Have you dealt with a partner that lacks a sex drive? Anyone know any techniques for relaxing your gag reflex? I appreciate any feedback and comments.

**TL;DR Boyfriend has a lack of sex drive problem which has lead to a slippery slope of confidence issues for both parties. Do you have any suggestions for increasing someone's sex drive?**"

I worked three internships during my time in college (during summers and even during semesters). Two of them were in the automotive industry, and one was in the pharma industry. All of them were under the title of ""Manufacturing Engineer Intern."" My junior year, I tutored CompSci students to program robots, one of which competed at the national level in Ohio two years ago, and I also won a competitive grant my senior year of uni for young entrepreneurs; the grand prize was three months in my own office building. I was also the Vice President of Student Government all four years of acadamia and I have a Letter of Commendation from the US Navy for saving a retired veterans life in a parking lot. Needless to say, my resume is pretty stacked and I feel like I've had ample exposure to at least begin my career in an entry level position.

This morning I got my first job offer -- but was unflattered to find out the position was for a Process Engineering ""Technician"" at a wage of $21/hr. from a pharma company.

I found it kind of insulting, but should I accept the job? I don't want my first job to stunt my future career.

I want to stay ""local"" in the Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill/RTP area; but I don't know how to find jobs now that I've graduated. It was so easy finding internships in school because of mass emails to students.

Any suggestions? Don't be afraid to write a long reply, I will read it."

16485h,90,2013-01-07,[Operation Floodgates]  Stop The New Legislation In The House Committee On The Judiciary,Deradius,progun,https://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/16485h/operation_floodgates_stop_the_new_legislation_in/,"Folks, 

A large number of [gun control bills](http://onlygunsandmoney.blogspot.com/2013/01/lots-of-bills-filed-in-congress.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NoLawyers-OnlyGunsAndMoney+%28No+Lawyers+-+Only+Guns+and+Money%29) were introduced last week, all in the house of representatives, and all were referred to the [judiciary committee](http://judiciary.house.gov/about/members.html).

The incoming chair, [Bob Goodlatte](http://blogs.roanoke.com/politics/2012/12/19/goodlatte-will-be-key-player-in-gun-control-debate/), is opposed to new gun control measures.

The 2012 committee was comprised of 18 Republicans and 15 Democrats.

The upshot here is, **the house judiciary committee is our best shot at shutting most of this legislation down before it starts**.

In addition to calling your own representatives this week, here are the numbers for the members of the Judiciary committee.  As the 113th congress committee hasn't been formed yet, this list is subject to change, but generally most of them stick around from year to year.  Call as many as you can each day.  All is better than some, some is better than one, one is better than none.  Most of their officers open either at 8:30 EST or 9:00 EST.

Remember, no need to deliver a lengthy speech.  It's an intern on the other end of the line, marking tallies on a pad.  Just ring the phones and say something like, ""Please encourage the representative to say **no** to new gun control measures.  We need to shut these bills down in committee.""

If they ask for your zip code and you're not local, consider saying, ""I'm calling with respect to Representative [X]'s role on the Judiciary committee, where s/he is making decisions that affect every American.""  Then give them your zip code if you want.

Pro-gun reps need the call so they have big numbers to point to when they argue in our favor. Anti-gun reps need the call so they'll feel weak and be less likely to push the issue.

I get no karma for this post.

**EDIT**: Getting [some information](http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/266575-house-judiciary-committee-roster-to-undergo-changes) about possible committee roster changes.

**EDIT 2**:  I asked as many interns as I could if they were returning as I went through the call list.  Updated the list with the results.  For the last three (Sanchez, Waters, Watt), I was getting loopy and forgot to write down whether they're coming back, so if someone could ask and post in this thread, I'd appreciate it.

Also details from an earlier post which might give some context to my situation.",Williamjones4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/164549/going_to_college_for_the_first_time_ever_i_want/,"I am 18 and not totally sure what I want to do in college. I slacked off during high-school and haven't learned anything on my own. I have been accepted to a few schools miraculously though. Some schools are mor expensive than others so I may be going to a school close by to save money, if the program is still good.

The majors I have been looking at are Advertising, Graphic Design, and Computer Science. I know they are all different but I would like to do CS the most. I have no knowledge of programming but I want to get started before I go to college. I have one year before I set out for college and would like some advice on how to prepare for what is to come if I did want to pursue a career in CS.

Should I start teaching myself, through books or the internet math? What kind of math should I teach myself before going to college. I can't even do algebra correctly. The courses require up to Calculus 2, I can't even dream of doing that. Should I start from Algebra 1 and work my way up and teach myself until I can do Calculus 1 and 2?

Should I start programming before I start CS in college? Will this help me or will I not need to program until my third of fourth year? Programming will help me land an internship easier at least, right?

If I wanted to learn programming, could I match it with other degrees that are less math-intensive if I really struggled with math and couldn't get past CS? I am going to try and take CS but for me I cannot see it being remotely easy.

Thanks, hopefully you guys can answer my questions about teaching myself and getting prepared for my future in CS. Is the math in the CS courses used in programming at all? I have seen people post saying that when they got jobs in the CS field they hardly, if at all, used math in their line of work, is this true?"

2. In high school, had a 2.8 GPA.  
3. In college, declared electrical engineering as my major. Failed Calculus I twice.  Switched to Business MIS.
4. Had 1 internship working in IT.  Didn't like it.  Had 1 more internship working in marketing.  Loved it.
5. 3 months prior to graduating college, I started working full-time at a marketing agency.  Boss allowed me to come in work every other day so I can finish classes.  45k/year job.
6. Graduated from college in May 2012 with a 2.4 GPA.
7. Had an interview at a very promising startup for a marketing manager position.  Also had an interview for a marketing manager position at Apple.
7. In December 2012, received a job offer for a 90k/year marketing manager position at the startup.  Turned down interview the with Apple.
8. I wasn't even a marketing major.  I turned 23 in 2012.

The point of this post isn't to brag.  I just want to let you know that it's not all about grades when it comes to jobs.  There are probably tens of thousands of graduates with super high GPAs who are unemployed right now.  You need to separate yourself from the pack.

You need to know what field you want to work in, what kind of company you want to work for, how much you want to make, and go for it!  You need a plan.  You need to stick to it.  You need to work towards it.

For myself, as soon as I found out that I wanted to do marketing, I applied to marketing internships to gain experience.  Then I studied marketing on marketing websites/blogs almost every day(who needs to pay for expensive college?).  I also created personal projects for fun and to show off what I knew to employers. By the time I graduated college, I was more skilled than almost all marketing majors.

And instead of waiting to find a job after I graduate, I started working full-time at a marketing agency while I was still in college for a cheap rate because I knew companies like prospects that come from consultant roles in agencies.

My advice to you all in college:

* Know what you want to do early and understand that unless you are rich, you'll need to work in a profession that companies actually need.  So no art history major(unless you are rich). Business/Engineering/Economics majors are best if you want a job right away after college.

* If you don't have one yet, sign up for a LinkedIn account and fill out your profile.  If you don't have a lot of experience, write about what you want to do after graduation.

* Actually spend time on LinkedIn.  Add people in the profession that you want to work for as connections and look at their work experience so you know what how to get to their level eventually.  For example if you want to work as a software developer, add software engineers, VP software engineering, software architects as connections.

* Apply to internships! I would have started applying in my freshman year in college if I knew what an internship was.

* Create personal projects that you can show to employers.  For example, if you are a software engineer, create a program.  If you are a statistics major, create a model to solve a problem.  If you are an economics major, start a blog and write your thoughts on how to solve our economic issues.

Hopefully you'll get this a year from now whilst still in good health. Having started to write this at 4 am, 7th January 2013,  I want you to know that it is imperative that you get your shit together. I realise that writing things like this early in the morning after no sleep is a good idea, I nevertheless want to make sure you complied with things to improve upon your life. There is no real importance to why each are where they are in the list, but here are some goals I want you to have accomplished by the time you read this a year from now, before you turn 22...

1. I hope you lost the weight. It is ultimately the key to our happiness and self image that you have done so. Seriously. Go treat yourself to something nice if you accomplished this. If you haven't, then you are a fat fucking worthless piece of shit who won't get anywhere in life without any convictions or the ability to hold goals and accomplish them. 70lbs isn't too much to ask. You fucking did it already your sophomore year of highschool for fuckssake.

2. GPA GPA GPA... Your first semester after transferring led you to a 2.47. Fucking disgraceful. That's not even including the one class you dropped because you didn't give any time or effort into it and got a fucking 15% on the first exam. Fuck you, you're smarter than that, and I hope to discover that you didn't fuck up the class the second time. Not only that but, whilst I know it may be difficult, I know you can get extremely close to a 4.0. You fuck. You're smart enough. You need to work on these things.

3. Dress better. I hope you find you having learned to dress better and take pride in yourself. Goes along with the weight loss but you still dress like a high schooler in a way, so I hope you got your shit together because when you read this you are going to be close to turning 22...

4. Get a job/internship. Right now in 2013 you are unemployed, though not necessarily due to you, but because your job fucked you over (assholes) but I hope to find that you managed an internship or any other kind of decent paying job. After all you need to be able to afford your apartment in the fall like you plan on. This lack of money thing sucks.

5. BE MORE FUCKING CONFIDENT I swear if you're not you're dead.

6. Be on top of things more. That's right. Schedule that doctor's appointment, get your medication filled, get stuff turned in on time, keep up on your laundry. Right now in 2013 you rarely have clean clothes and you often have to wash things the night before because you are too fucking lazy to get it done. 

Those are most important, though you do have a list of 25 total things you wish to accomplish. I hope to find that a lot of them are done. See below....

Best of luck and hope to find you the better happier you. No more of this bullshit. Time to work on being a productive adult.

I'm French, he's Irish and we met in Dublin because i'm studying there for 2 years. 

We already spent 3 wonderful months together and might be separated again in 3 months. I have to do an internship and even though I want to do it in Dublin, I might have to do it elsewhere. 
The tough part will begin in August. I have to study 2 years in France and during the month of August will have to move and settle down in France. 
Here come my doubts and fears, after the month of August I might never go back to Ireland for a long period of time and I would like to get into a LDR but I don't know if it's worth it because we don't know if we will ever be in the same city again. 
When I talked to him about it he said that he will wait for me while I study in France and when I told him that I might never go back to Ireland he said that he would go and get me wherever I am. He's the nicest person I ever met and we both want our relationship to continue. We have many tastes in common, we're never bored when we are together and talks over Facebook chat almost everyday. It's the first time I fall in love and I don't want this relationship to ends so soon. 

I'm not sure if I can handle a LDR, I've got self confidence issues and often feel insecure when I'm not with him. I trust him and there's a very good communication between us but sometimes I doubt. It lasts a couple of minutes and I feel really bad after but it all goes away when I'm talking with him or when I'm with him. 

I wonder if a LDR is the best option, I don't know if I can handle it but I know I can't break up with him in August. I would like to have some advices or to hear similar stories. 

Thanks for reading me

Tl;DR: French girl fell in love with Irish guy, we'll be separated in August for 2 years and might never be in the same country again. Looking for advices and/or similar stories"

163teh,3,2013-01-07,20 year old college sophomore with a question about paying off student loans early,radil,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/163teh/20_year_old_college_sophomore_with_a_question/,"I am a 20 year old college sophomore studying chemical engineering at a state university. This summer I'll be working for a major chemical company as an intern. I'll also take off of school and work two non-consecutive semesters there, totaling to about 10 months working time before I graduate. During this time I'll make between $3300 and $4000 a month depending on my classification.

I have no credit history right now, I have no credit card or prior loans that have been or are being paid for. I have a car that I purchased in cash in high school from working for 3 years. That is really my only ""valuable"" possession (beyond $1000). I currently have about $1700 saved up, and I have about $2000 in stock that was given to me at different times in my life as gifts. 

Currently I am very fortunate to have only taken out one federal student loan for this semester and the past semester. The value of the loan is $6500 at an interest rate of ~2.4% (I'm sorry, I don't know the exact value off the top of my head). My parents are also doing fairly better financially and think, but can't make any promises, that in the future I shouldn't have to take out more loans. In this regard I am very fortunate.

This summer I'll work somewhere between 2-3 months depending on when my start and end dates are and I might have to relocate, which means paying extra living expenses since I am already leasing my current apartment through the end of the summer. So I'll hopefully make between $7000-$10000.

I have thought of two scenarios to handle this money. 

**Scenario 1**

**1.** Get a credit card this summer, and use that to build my credit/get an early start to have a longer credit          history. 

**2.** Take half of the money I earn (at the very least) and invest it/save it through some sort of mechanism       (Roth IRA, CD, unfortunately I don't have access to the 401k benefits at my company as an intern) that I could     access in 5-10 years when I need to put a down payment on a car or house. 

**3.** And of the other half of the money pay my living expenses, invest in a new wardrobe, reward myself for my            work, and then whatever is left after that lump back in with #2.

**4.** After I have graduated either pay off all of my loan at once with money I have saved from my internship or     from a hypothetical signing bonus that I might receive.

**Scenario 2**

&gt; I take all or almost all of the money I earn this summer alone to pay off my student loan. 
But with this scenario I have a few questions:

* Is there even a mechanism by which I can pay off a federal student loan before I graduate?

* Which will have the greatest effect on my credit score: Paying it all off at once, before I graduate; Paying it all off at once, after I graduate, before my grace period ends; Paying it all off over time, making more than minimum payments? I understand that in the third option I'll be incurring interest charges obviously.

* If you recommend this ""early loan pay off"" scenario, where 60-90% of my income is going to go towards paying off my loan, would you recommend me not getting a credit card yet? 

Keep in mind that I'll also be working the spring semester of next year, and the fall semester following that. The summer term is 2-3 months and the semester term is 3-4 months. So sacrificing this summer's earnings is a big deal to me, but a semester later I'll be able to reenter the work force. 

**I guess my main question is this:** Which of these two scenarios do you think would benefit me more? Paying off all of my (current, hopefully only) loans and sacrificing a summer's worth of earnings, or keeping those earnings and saving them for the future and paying my loans off in a much more normal fashion?

**EDIT:** I guess I forgot to include one reason that I had been considering scenario 2. It might sound kind of paranoid, but I'm worried about the effect that the bursting of the student loan bubble would have on loan holders. I've read a little bit about it recently and it makes me nervous. I understand that comparatively, and if what my parents hope is true, with my single loan I am in a better position than other loan holders. But if handling my loan as soon as possible and then not having to worry about whether or not the possible bursting of the loan bubble will effect me is a better option than whatever the potential outcome of that may be, then I'd like to consider it."

I graduated with honors in 2010 with a B.S. in marketing, minor in economics, and I couldn't find anything in my field at the time. I took a job in information systems, and then in 2011 started a graduate program which I am about to finish when my thesis is approved. My masters is in accountancy with an information systems concentration (my thesis is in network audit trail management).

I would like to get in to systems development, but I have had little luck landing a relevant position. It seems that the popular career track for a job like that is to go to get a technical major, intern in your Jr. and Sr. years, and then work with the college career center to land a job. I may have missed that boat.

I am willing to take a paid internship to prove myself if necessary. The issue is that most companies seem to consider internships something that happens in your Jr. and Sr. years of undergrad. Am I too far out of that to have a good shot at internships? With my experience/education, should I be trying another angle to get into this field? I feel that I am somehow ""locked out"" of most of the college-to-career opportunities because I missed the boat with my school's career center.

I appreciate the help!"

I have already attempted the FAR exam, but failed (got a 65 :|) and am planning to retake it by the end of January.

Anyway, I've noticed that the majority, if not everyone, who are studying for the CPA exam are also working or have had some work experience in the accounting field. I have not had any internships or any actual accounting work experience aside from a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting.

Edit: I forgot to add that I wanted to know how the job outlook was for anyone who is in the same position as me. With the economy being the way it is, I would assume even having passed the CPA exam wouldn't guarantee a high chance in landing a job for someone who has little to absolutely zero work experience, which I'm kind of ok with. I do plan on finding an internship after passing all 4 exams, or maybe find one during my studies if I'm ballsy.

I would also like to add that I'm not worried about passing/failing the exam due to lack of work experience. Studying for exams such as this is going to take copious amounts of studying and discipline, which I have had the misfortune of experiencing firsthand. I can imagine studying for the CPA exam *might* be easier for someone who is working in an accounting field, thus studying something they already know (generally at least)."

163lxm,4,2013-01-06,Can't be together.... Can't be apart....,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/163lxm/cant_be_together_cant_be_apart/,"Alright. I'm in an almost LDR that has been an on going three year experience (Let me explain...). It started in a strange way and nothing had been normal about it since. In the most basic terms, here is the story. I'll elaborate on anything if someone asks:

We met while I was visiting friends in his area. I came back home and we ended up building a very close friendship while I helped him try and date one of my friends out there. While I was helping him with that, we both started to develop feelings for one another. Regardless, he began dating her and I went off to college. I went through a lot of crazy stuff in my first year of college and he and I became even closer because of it. Eventually, we both expressed our feelings for one another. However, he was still dating my friend. I even had been dating a few people during this time. Basically, we knew we could never be together. But I ended up going out to visit him and his girlfriend (my friend) anyway. It was the absolute worst time of my life. It tore me apart seeing him with her and it tore him apart knowing how upset I was. But what could we do? We were just young kids hundreds of miles apart anyway. We did not talk for awhile after my visit. We tried but his girlfriend's jealousy took over on his end and we ceased communication. Eventually they broke up and we began talking again, but it was not the same. We both still had feelings but the pain from everything that happened was hard for both of us to get over, especially me. So while he was trying to make it happen, I was starting to push him away. I was at a new college (even farther from him) and I was really happy. I was happy to have him back in my life, but I felt like I could do better slash I was very scared of getting hurt again.

This is now two years into us knowing one another. I ended up having a conversation with my best friend from home and she kind of knocked some sense into me that obviously I was being crazy and that him and I were perfect for one another. I had just been too scared of being hurt again. However, I was kind of too late. We never stopped talking through all of this, but I had kind of forced the flirt and anything past friendship between us. So in normal girl gone crazy mode, I tried to salvage all that back as quick as I could... Dummy.

This is a few months into 2012, He and I have pretty much swapped roles. Then the most ridiculous thing happens. He decides that in order for me to move on, he's going to just stop talking to me because he thinks that I did something behind his back to ruin any other chances at relationships with anyone else. Which I swear I never did anything like that. (I mean I know I'm a girl, but I'm not THAT crazy) I was devastated. He wouldn't respond to me or speak to me. It was horrible. Then the worst news was finding out that I got an internship in his area for the summer...

Before I went to the internship, him and I did actually speak a few times (got to love alcohol). I told him where I was going to be and he did try and apologize. My feelings had been so hurt though and he obviously wasn't doing MUCH to fix anything, so I just didn't let him back in at all. But oh my gosh did I miss him. Wow. I tried to date other guys, even while I was in his area, and nobody compared. Nothing made me as happy as he did. Anyway, so I went to the internship and he did text me while I was out there, but I was just not having any of that. I was out there to pursue my career and my passions and I wasn't going to let him ruin that.

I got back to school in the Fall of 2012 (junior year) after having the best summer internship anyone could ask for. I was so happy to find the perfect career path for me and even though EVERYTHING else was going so perfect in my life, I wasn't complete. It was like there was just this stupid hole in my heart that I hated so much because I didn't want to still care about him. But I did. Oh, I did.

So once again, alcohol began to help out. Eventually, one of our drunk night conversations rolled into the next day... And it hasn't stopped since. He said he was terrified to come see me while I was there just because he knew how mad at him I was. He said he had been miserable for the months we didn't speak. He said he never could understand how he could miss someone he had barely ever spent time with, but he know knew he never wanted to live without me. He knows he has a ton to prove and he even sent me flowers after a serious talk one night just to show me he was actually serious.

I know it's not enough and he knows it's not enough. I know that I can't just up and forgive him in five seconds, but now that my future is going to have me moving to his area once I graduate... it's like we finally have a future. We don't have to push each other away because we'll never be able to be together anymore. We don't have to deal with that stress. It's also nice to know that he's grown up a bit over the last few years. When we talk now, he doesn't talk about us in vague terms or if's, he says ""when we're together"". He even told me how much he hated not being able to be my boyfriend, but I don't want to just up and decide we're official over the phone.

The other thing is that I'm actually very glad I didn't spend any of my summer with him now because I now I know I went and did my internship for ME and nobody else. I do love the career path I'm on and it has nothing to do with anyone else. I believe in God and I believe that everything happens for a reason. I truly do think a huge part of my summer being so amazing is that I didn't have him around. Now I could never blame anyone, especially him, for me choosing my career. I didn't pick it because it was near him. I chose it because it was what I wanted to do.

Wow, this ended up being so much longer than I anticipated. Anyway Reddit, what do y'all think? I know I'm only an almost LDRer of 3 years, but we are planning a visit right now so I know it won't be much longer until it's the real deal. Anyway, Suggestions? Advice? Questions? Help? Anything is appreciated. If anything, thanks just for letting me get it all written out!"

I'm really having trouble swallowing all this...,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/163guo/girlfriend_21f_and_i_21m_of_5_months_just_broke/,"My girlfriend (now ex... it really hurts to say that) and I dated for exactly months to the day (I just now realized that, now it hurts worse).

We've known each other since we were 3 and were friends in high school. I really liked her in high school but she never gave any obvious signs so I thought I was friendzoned. We ended up going to separate colleges and lost contact but reconnected our junior years of college.

We ended up getting internships in the same city and became closer and I realized I really wanted to date her. She actually initiated the talk that would eventually lead us to getting in a relationship--one day she asked me ""How would you classify our relationship"". From there I felt like I had a ""green light"" so I began pursuing her.

She was very awkward and slow about it at first. She then opened up to me and told me about her abusive father who died when she was 13, that she usually dates abusive assholes because of it, that she was seeing a therapist in order to help herself heal emotional, and she was taking medication for anxiety from all of it.

I really liked her and cared about her though so I didn't bother worrying about any of that and we started dating. When we went back to school it became long distance and after a while it felt like I was doing all the work. She never visited me; she hardly called me; I was doing all the visiting and calling.

She was also very physically distant. As in when I would kiss her it would feel like she wasn't kissing me, and we never even had sex. Most relationships I would have been out the door a long time ago because of this but she was really special to me so I thought it was just her wanting to take it slow due to her ""trust issues"".

Well she had been blowing me off and ignoring me this past week so I confronted her about it. Basically it came down to her emotional issues. I asked her about the physical distance and she basically said she never felt anything when we kissed and she never had the sexual desire for me. I asked her why she even wanted to date me then (since she basically initiated the transition from friends to relationship) and she said that she ""wanted to want me"" and that I was the ""perfect guy for her"" but because I had known her before and because she had a fear of intimacy (or so her therapist said) she never felt any physical desire for me. But she said she really wanted it to work out though.

I asked her how she dealt with previous relationships and she said she was the one who ended her LTR with her high school boyfriend for the same reason that it didn't work out for me. And her college boyfriend before me was apparently very emotional abusive and dumped her because as he put it, he ""just wanted to fuck dumb bitches, but she wasn't a dumb bitch"".

So we basically decided it wasn't going to work out. She said ""I know the 'it's not you, it's me' speech is a common excuse, but this time it really is me."" I don't know. I just feel completely rejected. Because I love this girl, and although she said she ""loves me as a friend"" she doesn't see me in ""that way"". I have a difficult time understanding that so I asked if she just thought I was unattractive or something and she said it wasn't that, it was just that she couldn't see me in that way.

I don't know. This hurt me a lot. Also especially because the physical part. It really hurts knowing that we didn't sleep together or do anything more than kiss, but she's had a bunch of sex with these abusive guys. It really brings up feelings of jealousy and I don't know, hurt.

Any advice? How do I get over her? She said she really wanted to be friends (of course, they always do) but I don't know how I can do that even if I really want to. And what does all this emotional stuff even mean? I honestly felt rejected when she talked about the whole ""it's not you it's me"" thing, so was it really her? Can anyone help explain all this? Any help through this would be great. I'm a wreck right now. Thanks.

**TL;DR Broke up with my long distance girlfriend (who used to be one of my closest friends) due to ""emotional issues"" that prevented her from seeing me as a sexual partner. Can anyone help explain these emotional issues and help me sort this out please? Thanks**"

I am having a GREAT time right now. Doing IT at the company I've always dreamt of working (not the same function as I thought it would be, but hey, working my way up), doing great stuff for even greater people, soon to have a open ended contract, making some good money, even better perks and I am only 20! You would've think that I have nothing to complain...

Well, I do. The problem is that it is a lot of work. I mean, A LOT. I don't mind, but sometimes, It's just too much. Pretty much a two-man job at the moment. If that isn't enough, I'm in my last year of school, which I want to finish, but it's really hard to keep up if you have a fulltime job on the side. 

My pool of concentration is empty. Have to work hard everyday, and when I want to recharge, the leftovers of the days before (because I can't get everything done) will haunt me in the weekend, which isn't relaxing. Then I aren't even talking about school yet. It is making my life a bit 'gray', not really going to work for fun, because I can't make progress (all i do is basicly helpdesk and system administration because there are so many incidents), school isn't fun (which I don't go to school for though, just want my last piece of paper). Even my weekends aren't real fun, because I am tired and unmotivated to do anything. 

I just... lost the spark. I am now living to work hard, so I can hopefully get a glimpse of my dream someday, instead of actually living my dream. To get that back, i have to finish one of the big, long, dragging projects at school or work. To do that, I need motivation. To get motivation, I need something to work for. See where I am going? 

It's getting late (I've also developed a bit of an insomnia), and I have to work early in the morning. My plans are finishing schoolwork (I think 60 hour workweeks entitles me to work for school at my job), searching for an intern (which is pretty hard) and hopefully finish one of the pesky problems that lingered around. 

I was thinking to place this in /r/OffMyChest, but I think this is a better place, because I want to ask you a question: what would you do? I don't think that someone has the golden key, but I do think someone can give me good advice. Thanks in advance. :)"
163ew4,49,2013-01-06,I just wasn't built for customer service.,status_quo69,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/163ew4/i_just_wasnt_built_for_customer_service/,"So r/talesfromretail, I'm a longtime lurker and I love hearing all the horror stories, so I thought I would submit one of my own from last summer. Sorry for the wall of text in advance.

**Background Info**

* I'm a college student with little to no customer service/retail experience

* I had recently gotten an internship related to my major which caused me to work 8 hour shifts in a factory, 5 days a week

* Said internship was an hour away so I left my home at 6 in the morning and didn't get home till about 7 at night.

* To get more money I applied for a local job at McDerps.

* I got the job at McDerps

* I have no customer service experience

* They put me at the front counter

* My trainer was 16 years old and couldn't care less about telling me how to do things (to be fair, it really wasn't that much, but I tended to get confused with the high paced environment)

* It was my second training shift (out of 3 total), scheduled at 8 in the morning, 5 hour shifts


So enough background, I'm sure you get the picture. This story takes place on a weekend back in June. The factory I work at is about 110 F on a daily basis, it's dirty, exhausting, and on top of it I get to get up early on the weekends to work this extra job for 5 hours a shift. The only thing I had to look forward to was a 3 day concert that I had planned with a buddy about 3 hours away.

**The Story**
 *It was 45 minutes before my shift ended. The lunchtime rush was close, but I should miss it. The breakfast lunch was basically over. I was almost free*

ENTER OLD GUY

Me: Hello sir, may I take your order?

Old Guy: Yes, I'll have two Sausage Biscuit sandwiches, a senior coffee, and [INSERT REST OF ORDER]

Me: *Punches in order, stupidly hits ""Sausage Biscuit with Cheese."", which is barely indistinguishable from the Sausage Biscuit* Alright sir, that'll be 11.64. *Hits total button so customer can swipe card*

Old Guy: *Swipes Card*

.

.

.

Old Guy: Wait that's not right

*Shit, well he swiped his card. Now I have to call a manager over to refund him his money. Simple right? Wrong.*

ENTER MANAGER

Manager: Sorry sir, [ME] told me he made a mistake with your order. I'll happily refund you your money in cash. However, since you did use a credit card, the expense will still show on your report.

Old Guy: I don't understand.

Manager: Sorry, sir. [Proceeds to explain it again, meanwhile being polite and very nice about the entire thing.]

Old Guy: You aren't making any sense to me, I don't understand why you cannot explain in a better way *getting increasingly belligerent and rude as this is occuring*

Manager: I'm sorry sir- *Interrupted by old guy*

Old Guy: Why don't you go write it out for me? Jesus I need to have an accountant with me to understand this crap.

Manager: Certainly sir. *As she walks by me* I AM an accountant.

Old Guy: *Looking at me, the guy who screwed up his order* Jeez who hired these broads to work at the counter? They need to get less emotional eh?

Me: *Dumbfounded silence*

*Manager returns with a paper written out with the explanation, tries to explain*

Old Guy: You still aren't making any sense to me, this is ridiculous! (At this point yelling) I want to speak to your boss! (This is over a $2 mistake, just for perspective)

Manager: Absolutely sir, I'll go get bossman.

BOSSMAN ENTERS

*Bossman starts politely explaining what had happened to the old guy. I stopped paying attention because at this point I was off my shift. I clocked out and as I was walking towards the bathroom to change, the Old Guy walked away from the counter with his $2 and corrected order.*

THE END

*Oh wait, after I came out of the bathroom, Old Guy goes back up to the counter and loudly demanded to speak to Bossman again. I was never scheduled at that job again.*

The ACTUAL End.

Tl:Dr Old guy makes my 2nd ever training shift hell on earth for my managers and boss, was never scheduled again for job."

I'm also wondering, since I have some teaching experience (it's on my CV, but I don't mention it in my SOP), should I talk about it in my SOP? It's not necessarily relevant to this program since there aren't teaching fellowships for Master's students, but is it something I should talk about just because it's nice to have?
Thank you in advance!

My motivation to earn a graduate degree in psychology stems from my passion for psychological and brain sciences, my desire to become an experimental psychologist and university professor, and the necessity to learn as much as I can in my chosen field. Through thorough academic preparation and several years of experience in neuropsychological research, I have transformed into the ideal candidate for the Master's of Awesome Science at the University of Equally Awesome Science.

I sought out my first experience in psychological research during my second year of college: a position as a research assistant in a child development lab. My main responsibility was to learn a complex coding scheme and use it to correct discrepancies between codes in previously coded narrative transcripts of maternal word choice in picture book reading. Through my involvement in this project, I gained experience with the post-experimental aspects of behavioral psychology. I continued to work on this project throughout my undergraduate career, and I am currently in the process of helping to train incoming research assistants, as well as beginning some preliminary statistical and data analysis.

In addition to my experience with research in behavioral science, I had a strong interest in neuroscience methodology, and sought an internship in an event-related potential (ERP) lab. Initially, my responsibilities were to run adult participants in ERP studies, which involved attaching scalp and eye electrodes, explaining event-related potentials to participants, and troubleshooting if participants had any questions or if programs went awry. During the summer of 2012, I accepted a research assistant position in the Undergraduate College ERP Lab, which not only afforded me the freedom and funds to pursue my own research interests, but also gave me valuable experience running child ERP participants. I left my summer placement confident in my ability to program studies in E-Prime 2.0, to recruit and schedule participants, efficiently execute data entry, and to explain neuroscience to children in ways that are both engaging and exciting to those with no prior interest in science. 

My positions in research for the last 3 years, as well as my experience designing and carrying out my own undergraduate research thesis have given me a thorough understanding of some of the frustrations psychological research can present. I have worked on projects tirelessly for months, only to find that researchers in Finland have been working just as hard on the exact same project, and have published their findings just as I begin data analysis. I have programmed and piloted a series of studies, only to realize after recruiting and running many participants that adding additional trigger numbers to stimuli could have yielded even more interesting research. These speed bumps have only made my passion for science stronger, and although there are numerous challenges in the process of psychological discovery, the rewards yielded by the findings of a study, whether they are expected or unexpected, make the frustrations along the way totally worth it.

My personal research interests stem from a fascination with human emotion, interpersonal interaction, and how we use our own experiences to relate to others. My undergraduate thesis, a novel ERP study on the role of mood congruency in the implicit processing of emotional faces, was my first real foray into the field of empathy research. My study yielded significant findings that present potential new challenges to the field of affective empathy research: since mood congruency is important in our processing of emotional facial expressions, the validity of some previous research on the empathetic response (that has not considered mood congruency as a variable) may come into question. Should I be granted admission to the Master's of Awesome Science Program, I would hope to continue this research on emotion and empathy at the University of Equally Awesome Science, using the same or a similar paradigm to more closely examine the role of the cross-race effect in mood congruency and implicit emotion processing, as well as to correlate the ERP amplitude responses to mood-congruent faces with participants with both high- and low-trait empathy. 

Master's of Awesome Sci at U of Eq. Awe. Sci. is the ideal place for me to begin my graduate studies in Psychology. The individualized structure of the program is one in which I have experience, and one in which I thrive. My undergraduate program allowed me to design my own major and academic concentration, excel in graduate level courses, gain unprecedented research experience, and carry out every aspect of original psychology and neuroscience studies, from the discovery of an idea to the programming of stimuli, to running participants, to data collection and analysis. Although I do not necessarily expect this amount of freedom at the Master’s level, my undergraduate experience has given me the discipline, responsibility, and tools to successfully navigate my own education. Additionally, your program will give me the opportunity to learn from those whom I consider “science rock stars,” whose research I have admired for years.  

My education in brain science will not end at the Master’s level. I aspire to earn a PhD in psychology with a concentration in integrative or social neuroscience, and conduct empathy and emotion research in academia, as well as teach at the university level. My life’s ambition is to research the neural bases and psychological manifestations of affective empathy, and discover novel ways to facilitate these neural processes so humans can best allocate our resources to understand and empathize with each other.

In 2010 I had to call the ambulance because my mom was having really bad abdominal/stomach pain. They rushed her to hospital, turns out her intestine had ripped open. There was an emergency surgery and they had to remove her large intestines and she was given a colostomy bag. Well she eventually came home from the hospital and my world was turned upside down. She had trouble doing many things but it wasn't so bad.

Fast-forward to 2011 they put her intestines back inside her and things were going to be better. They weren't. Her stomach wouldn't heal correctly. She went in for a check up at the free clinic like she did every other week (her doctor said he'd check on her there). He asked a intern to take her to a sterile room and undo the incision half an inch so he can get a camera and look inside. The itnern takes my mom to a room where someone just lefts and he completely opened her up. The doctor came in, asked intern to leave and he went out and yelled at him and the doctor re sewed up her stomach and we left.

The next week or so my mom started feeling ill, fever and her stomach was a little swollen. We go to get her looked at and she now has MRSA. Having MRSA and other complications her stomach wouldn't heal. 

Fastforward to 2012 they had put in mesh in to help heal her stomach. It wasn't working. Turns out they used the trans vaginal mesh that had been recalled inside her and her body was trying to push the mesh out. They would not remove the mesh. But she had another surgery that was supposed to fix everything but it didn't the wound again would not heal. My mom is also overweight and the pull of her stomach didn't make this easier but after the surgery she had a 13in hole in her stomach that wouldn't heal. I mean a hole that I could put my hand in and could reach inside her. She was completely useless now. I hate saying it but she was. She could not get out of bed. 

She came home and everything hit me even harder. I was still in highschool but always having to worry about my mom and having to take care of her took everything out of me. I couldn't keep up friendships, I had a girlfriend but I started to drift away from her, I felt alone...I still do. Nobody understands what I have to do everyday.

So I started college. I did my best first semster but I was also moving me and my mom to my dads old house. My grades were reall bad. Now we are into my dads old house and we've been here for 3ish months. He bought a new house and he needed someone to stay at this house to take care of it so that's why we moved in. My dad has had a gf for a few months and she hates us. After my dad ASKED us to move into this house that HE PLANNED TO GIVE TO ME he suddenly now wants to sell it and has asked us to move out. What are we supposed to do? My mom gets disability checks but it's not a lot. We only get 1,100 a month. Add food,gas, and bills we have nothing left. 

So now I have to find and apartment for me and my mom to move into. Something that costs under $550 and is big enough for me and my mom. Now I know people have it much worse than me but I'm tired of being ignored. Nobody acts like it's a big deal. I don't complain about it at all. I try my best to look on the bright side and think things will get better but they don't. My gf left me, I can't get a job anywhere, I have to find an apartment AND move all of me and my moms stuff, I gotta go to college ontop of all that and take care of my mom everyday.

She tries her best to help but she only messes things up. I don't complain because I have nobody to talk too. I don't have friends, no girlfriend, nobody and I hate it, I hate myself. I'm so socially awkward to everyone. I'm stressed. I just don't how much more I can take. I'm ready to just shut down and put a bullet in my head. I don't want to live like this anymore.

**TL;DR** I'm pushed to my limits and I'm ready to kill myself.

**EDIT**: There's more that I could add here but I left quiet a bit out for lengths sake."

Advisers and professors have made suggestions about what professions I should look into. I have been told I write very well and my grades have always been very high. One professor suggested I look into library sciences and archiving as alternative professions.

Recording bands on location with a mobile recording studio you have to move a lot of things fairly quickly. Often, you just have one day for a recording session so time is very valuable.

Everytime you grab a thing think about where it has to go in the end. When you have to prepare something before you can movevit do that first.
Don't just grab a thing and move it. Grab it, move it and prepare it as far as possible so that you don't have to touch it again later.

Anyways, I am currently an intern at a specialty truck manufacturer and had been given a task.  It is essentially data clean up.  I was given an excel file that contained records that failed a process (missing information in records).

I was told to bring up each record using queries and check the record to see part of the data was missing and if it was I would look at the excel sheet and put in the appropriate information in the appropriate field and update the record.  I had hundreds of records and had to do it manually.

My first thought immediately was to create a python script that would grab the key from the excel file and select the record from the database.  Check if a field in the returned query was missing information and then if it was I would go to the excel file and grab the appropriate input for that record and update the record using a sql statement and then move on.  Bonus points would being able to format the row in excel with a certain color as in if it had been changed or some other condition.

So my question is can anyone point me in the right direction on how I can achieve this?  I am not sure how to look up something like this.

My concern looking for an engineering internship is my lack of industry specific (software, especially) skills.  I have taken 3 semester calc, and a semester each of linear alg and dif eq.  I have taken a bunch of physics, including classical mechanics and electronics, so I can have intelligible conversations with my friends at the big engineering school.

I would really appreciate your opinion on one (or more) of the following:

* What is covered in your entry-level ""ENG 101"" class?  

* What textbook did you use in said ""ENG 101"" class?

* Am I really at as large of a disadvantage that I think I am?  I'm decently smart, and a quick learner with a deep physics background with a natural curiosity of how things work.  But I have no industry-specific skills (besides maybe MatLab, LaTeX, and Mathematica), which is why I'm looking for an introduction before I would have an interview.

* How important are knowing the engineering software programs?

* Anything else you think is relevant, or you would like to talk about.  If you're still reading, I appreciate it--and will listen to any rant of yours.  "

Started smoking daily during my first year of college (2011-2012), quit for 3.5 months over the summer (2012), and thought I had a handle on my problem when I went back to school in the fall. First i'd just smoke with friends, then bought myself a gram when i got stressed. At the end of the semester I was so wrecked that I bought an eighth and smoked a bowl every night after my work was done during finals/exams week. Then I got dependent on weed for sleeping so while visiting my mom in Texas for Christmas, my sister (who is a proud Californian stoner) and I ate a square of weed chocolate each night before bed (made me feel shitty and hungover the next day, ugh). Got home, spent 3 days sober, then one of my BFF's from high school and I reunited and decided to smoke a jay together in the snowy woods under the stars. On New Year's Eve dad offered me some weed chocolate my sister sent him. I stopped again for about 4 or 5 days, but then I started taking from my dad's stash for 3 days straight, until today. The days I wasn't using weed or busy with friends, I was taking xanax from my dad.

I see myself participating in this cycle of addiction--rationalizing, justifying, etc. (I'm home and bored, I got an amazing internship for the summer, I worked my ass off this semester so I deserve it, etc.) I guess i feel like because I went to a restictive/therapeutic boarding school for cutting myself to cope and family issues driving me away from home, I didn't get much of a childhood. Now I'm at a prestigious women's college at which the mentality is very much work-hard-play-hard. It's hard for me to be a part of this culture when there is an honest adult inside of me saying I shouldn't be smoking weed. I want to be able to ""be a kid"" but also be my adult self, because my adult self is the best version of myself (my therapist is always saying this and it's true IMO). Especially since my grades were NOT what I wanted them to be. I expected three A's and a B-/C+. Ended up with an A-, two B+'s and a C+. I wanted straight A's of course. My GPA didn't even break through the 3.0's!!!! I wanted to get into a conference at Harvard for which I really thought I was a shoe-in, but I was rejected. 

This summer, when I had quit weed, I was exercising 5 days a week. At school, my stress was insane with all of my extra curricular activities, internship and academics, and breaking up with my boyfriend (but still talking to him, calling him when I'm anxious or depressed, generally depending on him) yet I wasn't dealing with the stress in a healthy way. I stopped exercising, started using the weekends--when everyone is partying--as my release. Drinking too much too early, getting high. I even relapsed (cutting) twice this semester. The weed use also led to my use of other unhealthy coping skills I love to indulge in--isolating myself and binge eating junk. Through it all I'd get angry with myself and call the recent ex-boyfriend crying.

I really believe that if I channel my stress in healthy ways before turning to the unhealthy mechanisms that are much easier--weed, food, partying, cutting, isolating, dependence upon others, whatever--then I will feel better and can really begin achieving my dreams and fulfilling my life. it's now just a matter of getting myself there.

I've been thinking for a few years about getting on a low dose of a long acting anti-anxiety medication. Prescribed, medically, to me and not my dad. Prescribed by a doctor who knows what they're talking about, not decided by my own anxious mind. I'm hoping that might give me the push I need to get to the point where I can push through my anxiety and SUSTAIN healthy coping skills, not have quick runs with them before falling back into an addiction to self-medication and unhealthy means of dealing with my anxiety.

Anyway I'd love some support, advice, feedback, reddit hugs, anything. I know my biggest battles while quitting/withdrawing will be: sleeping, mood, maintaining a healthy lifestyle while at college.

Boutique private equity internship (technically a search fund, if you are familiar) Summer 2010

Investment banking internship Summer 2011

Hopefully CFA level II candidate after January 2013

Current experience: patent investments analyst (write reports that help clients make decisions on patents they own or want to own)

3.5 GPA from top 25 Undergrad University in Business Administration

3.7 GPA from top 25 Undergrad University in Economics (double degree)

Hi all, just found this subreddit, looks to be a great place for me to both give and get advice. I will have been out of college one year in February of 2013. I’m in a somewhat niche area of finance, valuing patents and providing acquisition advice, mainly for patent portfolios for various clients. I'm in a consulting business based on patents. I took this job coming out of college because 1. I wanted to be in San Francisco Bay Area (home) and 2. I didn’t want to do investment banking, and that was the career I had been grooming myself for all of college. Needless to say, I went into fall recruiting my senior year a little lost because I had no ""plan B"" for a scenario where I didn’t want to do investment banking.

My current role is not stimulating me as much as I'd hoped nor is it the area of finance that I would like it to be. Given my prior internship experience and current reporting-focused experience, I believe that a role in sell-side equity research is probably the best fit for my skills and interests. Alternatively, a buy-side role at a mutual fund or fundamental long-short hedge fund (aka grandslam for me, lol) is also in my sights, though I’m sure that my success at find such a role is slim. I want to stay in the San Francisco Bay Area in terms of a job.

Questions:

Given that I have 1 year of experience, should I be gunning for positions given to undergrads right out of college and position myself as someone skilled but at the same “price” for the firm?

How should I go about recruiting in equity research? I have access to ThomsonOne at work, so I could conceivably start creating a database of phone numbers of equity research analysts in San Francisco Bay Area and cold-calling or emailing if that would be a good use of my time. Any thoughts?

Should I continue to study for the CFA level II exam and then recruit? Would that make me a more attractive candidate?

Does staying at my current job for another year pigeonhole me further? Should I jump ship now if a long-term career in intellectual property is not my goal?

Are there any other roles in finance that may fit my skills/interests? I really enjoy value investing (I run my own portfolio) and picking stocks.

EDIT: I understand that I have alot of questions.  If you can provide your opinion on just one of them, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks!"

A little background first. I am a college graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Homeland Security, with a ""Cyber Security"" track. (Yes, I know ""Cyber"" is a buzz word but that's what it says on the piece of paper. Upper management tends to fawn at it. Go figure.) I went to a medium sized telecom company as a Security Administrator Intern to get my last six internship credits, and stayed there for as long as they could manage to retain me. Once that job ended, I moved to a new company as an IT Operations Technician.

I've been handed a job offer by my old company that I went to for that internship. They want me to be an IT Security Analyst I, working full time. This seems like a great opportunity. Compared to my current job, I'd be getting comparable benefits, a slight pay raise due to the shortened commute and lack of taxes (getting a job in a tax free state rocks). The only thing I'm losing is my current company's PC Reimbursement program and a week of vacation per year. And yes, IT Security is what I want to do for a living.

But the problem is I feel a loyalty to my current company, almost to the point that it's making me debate turning down this new job offer. Have you guys ever run into this before? My current company's never done wrong by me. It's a great environment with great co-workers and a great boss... It's just an extremely long commute, and not the field I want to be in for the rest of my life.

I guess what I'm saying is, what are your thoughts? Do you, /r/computertechs, think it's worth it to move, despite the unexplained loyalty? Thanks for taking the time to read this.

As someone who is 19 years old now and a sophomore in college, I feel as if my life is not going anywhere at all. For years, ever since freshman year of high school, I have been depressed. I have put a mask on in order to hide my feelings and a slew of lies in order to cheer me up. As I get older, I get the sudden revelation that my lies are getting to me and acknowledging the false sense of reality in a hell I have created for myself.

I have been finding multiple guinea pigs to throw my blame on, and I know deep down that the blame is primarily on myself and no one else.

My entire life I have had only a hand full of friends that I could rely on, all of which I have left. I'm a military brat, so as is I constantly move. Reality always became better for myself in the last year I had in X location. I would get a circle of friends that genuinely would care for my well being. Constantly I would move to a new location, to start back at square 1. 

I started to chat with people on the internet in order to create a reality where I can escape the depression I have had. This did not solve anything for me but rather showed me that I was the dirt bag in my life. I was the problem.

In order to overcome the loss of friends over my life, I chatted with people online. People I could not leave simply from moving. The same internet community I fell obsessed with a girl I did not even know years ago. Friend zoned, thought to be pathetic (which I agree looking back now), and heart-broken. The only person I actually liked and felt that they would like me for who I was did not turn out to be true at all. Years later, I am not obsessed anymore but rather this still sticks in my head. I have trust issues just from this encounter. Confirmed countless times, people do not like me as a person. My fear of rejection (even with a 3 girlfriends after this incident) has escalated because of this. 

All of my dreams I have had about what I could be, people told me they were just idiotic dreams that would never come to be. My father and mother included. I constantly put the blame on my parents as they were never there to support me as an individual. Everything I know I have learned myself. My parents were there to give me a roof over my head and food on the table, something that I fully accept and duly appreciate, but alas my character never grew. My interests in various things never grew, and I never knew myself as a person.

My entire life I aspired to become a USAF pilot. I did not care what plane, I did not care where I would be stationed at, I merely wanted to fly. That to me was the ultimate dream. I ask myself every now and then why I wanted to do this. My father was in the USAF and I would conclude that was what inspired me. I finally know the answer to this question, and that is because to me flying is the ultimate form of freedom. If for whatever reason I was feeling down on myself, I could simply climb into a plane and fly and not have a care for those hour(s) in the air. 

My father would tell me constantly that I was going to end up not ever flying, and that it was a pipe dream to ever do so. Whenever I sparked this conversation on what interests me, my parents would push what they believed would be the ultimate career field. I never had a say in what I wanted.

Enter senior year of high school. I tell my father that I would be applying for the United States Air Force Academy. He simply did not help me at all. Being a teenager who had to learn various skills and how to do things on my own without my parents help and ignoring my talks about what I wanted to do in life, I had no idea how to apply. I have told multiple people in my life that I was accepted to USAFA but simply did not end up going there as it was not a typical college experience. I never applied.

My father applied for the college that he wanted me to go to. A private college that costs more / equal to a lot of prestigious schools; 60,000 a semester. My major? The only major there that I knew where I belonged was engineering. As a kid I loved anything mechanical, multiple interests in taking things apart and rebuilding them to try to attempt to make them better; all ended in failures. My father scoffed at this idea and simply told me engineers are very highly skilled and will get a job instantly, but for the hell I would go through, I would be making the same amount of money as any other sought after major. He changed it to a major that is basically criminal justice and another major in chinese cultural studies (I will not say what is the exact major name, as this would instantly make it obvious what college). 

I joined AFROTC in order to go after my dream. As I did everything, as I did PT, as I did everything required it just stuck in my head it was a false hope. I talked to my father for some reason, and he told me to drop AFROTC. I simply took his advice for some dang reason. I tell people that I am currently about to go to field training and have high chances of getting a pilot slot. A lie.

As I am sitting here now, I am fluent in Chinese. I was supposed to go to China for my major, but decided not to as it did not interest me at all. I have told people I did went there, but in reality I sheltered myself in my room by myself in order to rethink how I can get out of this hell.

Last semester of college, I dropped all of my classes as I simply could not take it. As I dwelled into my major, I became more depressed realizing that the direction in life that I am taking is not where I want to be, nor what I want to do. 

Since I dropped my classes, the VA (Veteran Affairs) sent me a letter stating since I dropped my classes, that I owe them 4,000 dollars for room &amp; board for my decision. I told both my parents that I simply did not take the amount of credits I needed since I was ""ahead"" and wanted to slow things down. Another lie added under my belt.

I owe both the VA, my parents, my college and my fraternity that I joined a slew of money. I can't handle it. I do not want to tell my parents this as it would lead to further disappointment from them. 

My father recently opened a business where I work with him. Every so often I will go in to help. My mood and facial expressions and body language shows that I am depressed. During this winter break, my father finally told me that if I were a regular employee he would have fired me a long time ago since I am a shithead because of my attitude and that I was a disappointment. Last summer, he fired me and yelled at me for an hour and told me to pack up my things and leave the house. I did just that, following an apology on my behalf. More disappointment from my parents. My father has told me countless times that he can not wait for me to move out so he did not have to deal with me.

I joined a fraternity in order to find people who could help me in my situation. They are there for me, but at the same time they have alluded to the fact that I am an untrustworthy individual that holds no promises. Again, as a person, I am the problem.

I have told both my parents, my friends, and family friends that I have been offered internships to multiple places. All of those were lies to make myself feel better that I could end up somewhere in life where I am slightly successful.

Multiple times in my life, I have put my burdens on select few people. I never took the time to fix them myself, in order to learn the error of my ways. Whenever I tell people my problems, they offer solutions. I never listened. These past two years, I have taken responsibility for my actions and tried to fix them on my own. 

I can not take it anymore. I can not even get myself to cry anymore to feel better. Lately I have found my escape through alcohol and tobacco in order to cope with my problems. Lately, that has not been doing anything anymore. 

I am simply looking for someone to talk to, to help me out once again in my life. I have typed this post out a multitude of times in the past 5 months, and now it's just coming crashing down on me with a multitude of more problems, such as money.

I am currently not able to enroll in college because of dues I can not pay, and can not seek a job to pay for these bills. The only job I can get is working with my parents, who further my depression, and to whom I have no admitted to any of these things. 

I have attempted suicide twice in my life, and have contemplated it for a long time still to this day. To the past people who have helped me, I lie to them to act as if I am better off now, but in reality I am not. I'm worse off than I was ever before with the lying, constant depression, and the bills that are now starting to pile up.

If I were to go see a professional psychologist or to even get medication for my depression, the career fields I dream about will never become reality with those being on my record. And as such, I can not seek help; not to mention that would cost money.

I can not hold this false reality in my head anymore. "

166d20,2,2013-01-08,I'm a 5th year EE student and I need advice about possibly changing majors.,[deleted],eldertrees,https://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/166d20/im_a_5th_year_ee_student_and_i_need_advice_about/,"These might just be rantings because I'm at about a [8] with caffeine and a [4] with a nice sativa, but I might as well get some use out of a rant. So I come to you guys to advise me. I'll probably get around to posting it to some other subreddit when I get the chance to edit some of the ramblings. But I think you guys would get where I'm coming from.

[TL;DR]
I'm a 5th year electrical engineering student who is thinking about switching to some type of audio engineering.
--
I'm a 5th year electrical engineering student with about a year left in school. Today was the first day back from my winter break tolerance break and it really has me thinking. The first two years of school, I loved my major. Along with acing all of my intro engineering classes, I was messing around with the arduino as a hobby. The two went hand in hand. As the classes got to a higher level, they got really technical and very mathy and less about actually creating and doing something useful. I didn't mind the math, I'm actually pretty damn good at it. I slowly realized that an actual engineering job would just be sitting around in a cubicle solving math or random design problems for some stupid thing that won't affect my life. I don't want to spend my life doing what boils down to repetitive math problems. It is killing my love for electronics and killing my grades. I feel like I can't do well in class unless I focus on just one part of it at a time. But I can't afford to drag out my degree for very much longer.

This lack of motivation is fucking with my head. It's causing a lot of anxiety and depression. I got a prescription for zoloft and that has helped a bit. Trees help me see the the bright side of things but it makes my mind wander a bit too much sometimes (like now).

I was watching the documentary Moog on netflix and it got me thinking about the things I love and the things I'm good at. It got me thinking about where I want to be in life and where I should be in life.

Arts have always been something that I love and can connect with. But throughout my childhood I was always discouraged from pursuing that as more than just a hobby. I never picked up any musical instrument, I was never technically trained in any type of graphical medium. I picked up photoshop and vector design skills from playing around with it enough, but not at a level to do anything professional quality. I was really into photography for a few years. Right now, I'm really into cooking. It's really the first thing I feel proud to show others.

But I know that even though I love these things, I know that there is really no money in any of those. It's rare to succeed or have the stereotypical stable life when you make those career choices. 

The Moog documentary made it finally click. I connected with Moog. I've always loved the technical aspects of music. I loved messing around with fruityloops or ableton. But because I never learned to play any instrument, I had no idea what I was doing nor did I have the time to learn an instrument and pass my classes.

My choices are:

* grit it out and try to finish my degree. Hopefully get a job in the power industry or something. Hate my life.

* Figure out if designing electronics for some type of musical instrument company or something like that is a good carreer. Hate my life a little bit less.

* Take a year off and intern at a music studio doing shitty gruntwork but actually learning something interesting. Possibly love my life, but would probably be shunned from my parents and everyone else who wants me to be an engineer. Possibly get a job in the field.

* See if my university offers a way to get an obscure audio engineering major. or transfer to an art school that does. Possibly love my life, wouln't be shunned from my family, but I would be poor as fuck paying for expensive loans.

Give me any and all oppinions please reddit. Thanks for reading."

166bpd,10,2013-01-08,had a Game Grumps dream...,CountMecha,gamegrumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/166bpd/had_a_game_grumps_dream/,"In the dream they had hired me as a personal assistant. The grumps were super rich and drowning in fame and wealth, they had this crazy rock bus and all this goofy expensive shit laying everywhere. But they were still the same Grumps, not really turned into super materialistic douche bag cliches.

I actually hung out with Arin alot more than Jon. Jon was gone for a significant portion, doing some kind of tour across the country. Not really alot went on except Arin and me hanging around in this goofily good looking house. In that particular moment, Arin is laying on a couch and he and I are talking about going to play basketball (makes me laugh thinking about it now) when Jon gets back from his tour. 

Arin's really excited to see him, Jon goes straight over to Arin, straddles him on the couch, faces inches apart and gives him the most sentimental 'I missed you.' I could ever make up. Arin replies equally serious 'I missed you too.'

Afterwards I'm showing them some kind of card game. Jon is being impatient and start shuffling the deck. But I try to tell him it's not that kind of game and that I have to separate the cards into different decks (like Mage Knight or Dominion or something if you're familiar with those kinds of games). And I'm trying to explain to him that different cards do different things and need to be sorted thus. He replies that the concept sounds really cool. But whenever I'd tried to get him to give me the deck so I could separate it correctly, he'd get pissed off and say 'Fuck this game! I don't know what to do!'

At the end I guess I was going home or something, like it was only a summer internship, but I was leaving the Grumps. And everyone was bummed out. They then offered to keep me on permanently, which I agreed. Arin sealed the deal by saying 'Get the man a sandwich!'

That's about all I remember, other than a random scene of Jon and Arin driving around in some hot dog bus.

I don't know where Barry was, he was probably editing my dream."

so basically, her formal education is entirely useless and it's crushing her.

now onto the meat of my question: i would like to help her find a lead into game design because i know it's one of the only things she would proudly pursue. she is technically skilled in many styles of art and has creativity that knows no bounds. she does have a little experience in design, too. a few years back, she provided the concept and artwork for the winning game in a ""24 hour game jam"" event and in college she took a game design course and received similar praise. 

with a portfolio of sketches, digital paintings, fine art, and previous game design, what can she do and where can she go to take the next step? are indie studios open to weirdos sending them emails? are there serious postings online? i believe in her; i want to help facilitate something before she crumbles into dust.

I could really use some advice. I graduated from college with a computer science degree last summer. It was pretty challenging for me but in the end I managed to creep my way up to a 3.0 GPA / 3.3 Major GPA. I didn't get an internship though, which was my first big mistake. 

After graduating and moving back home (near Los Angeles), I wasn't really sure what to do, and it took me a while to get the hang of fixing up my resume, applying to jobs, doing interviews and whatnot. The real problem is that up until about a month ago, I barely did any programming at all, so I got pretty rusty. I'm not sure why, but without the structured environment of school, I got really lazy and time flew by at an unbelievably quick pace.

So right now I find myself jobless, with a resume that has a suspicious 6 month gap. Even the last school project on there is from 2011. I've had only a handful of interviews over the phone, and one in person. The most recent one asked me about what I've been doing since graduating, so I can sense that the gap is becoming an issue. 

I know I've made alot of mistakes so far, due to both ignorance and laziness, but now I'm really starting to feel that I missed the window of opportunity, and I want to get things back on track. Do I keep applying to jobs hoping that I get lucky? Do I just focus on programming, maybe doing a few projects that I can add to my resume? Do I get a job in something unrelated for the time being? Look for an internship? All of the above? Something else? I want to get out of this ever-worsening situation but I don't want to make any more mistakes due to ignorance. What do you guys think the best course of action is right now?

1663jr,7,2013-01-08,Doing my duty to follow up with the community on how I got a job,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1663jr/doing_my_duty_to_follow_up_with_the_community_on/,"I graduated in mid december and I just landed a contract position at a good company that has potential to lead to different things there. Here is what I learned:

1. It's all about who you know - and I knew no one, like, I had no connections - it sucks!. _just find a way around HR_, it is easy to figure out the corporate emails of employees, email the manager or leader in that area and say you are interested. Whats the worst that could happen? You do not even have to use your full name, so you can still apply traditionally. For example, 8/10 times Dexter Morgan's company email at Microsoft is just dmorgan@microsoft,com or dexter.morgan@microsoft,com

2. It's all about timing - I was denied a job at this place originally and then the interviewer called me up 5 weeks later to say he remembered me and there was an opp for me. This is out of your control, you can just hope you are lucky?

I, just like you, applied to those job boards and heard nothing back. I just imagined what it must have been like to be the HR person on the other side of the screen who got to feel better and better about themselves everyday by looking at all the schmucks trying to get where they work. So, I went around them. Kind of. The best advice I can give, which can only apply to some of you, is work with recruiters/contract work. These are people that are given special privilege to opportunities and have connections to people at a lot of different companies. Call them, say you are interested in X type of work and see if you think there may be an opportunity. They will ask for your resume and it continues from there. The goal is not for a cushy job right away, but somewhere where you can at least have a chance to prove your worth and progress from there. Some contracts are truly contract work, some are like professional internships - jobs that need to be filled but companies quickly and cheaply fill them with potential incumbents and get to try them out. Similar to the probationary stage of full time jobs but without the benefits.

Prior to graduating I had a few internships and studied abroad. Econ degree. This didn't seem to factor into the qualifications; my personality, analytical background of econ, and some Excel experience are what sold it, I believe.

I may be back on here in a few months if the contract is up and no opportunities show themselves during that time, but I will do my darndest to earn my spot there!"
1663ef,8,2013-01-08,Need a summer intern or know of an opportunity? I'm your man!,EvanTheDork,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1663ef/need_a_summer_intern_or_know_of_an_opportunity_im/,"As a student studying both marketing and graphic design, I have a vast range of
talent that collides the worlds of art and business. I feel as though I would be a great
asset as a creative or account service intern. Leo Burnett once said, “Advertising says
to people, 'Here's what we've got. Here's what it will do for you. Here's how to get it.’”
Well, it’s my intent to tell you what I have, what I will do for you, and how you can
implement me as a part of your intern team.

One of my greatest skills has got to be communication. Between being a Windows 8 Tour
Promoter for Microsoft, my campus’s representative for Blackboard, interning in
e-commerce, being an account executive for AAF-UNI, and being the VP of Marketing for my
chapter of Pi Sigma Epsilon, I have had a lot of opportunities to develop that skill. My
communication skills aren’t restricted to verbal communication. I have always been an artist,
for as long as I can remember. I am an idea-man, and I believe I have the keen ability
to covey ideas and communicate through my art. My love of art has led me to explore many
assests of it, from painting to graphic design. I have taken numerous art courses and am
proﬁcient in both illustrator and photo-shop. Though I have had some fantastic
opportunities, I know the next step is to take these skills and apply them to an internship
with an industry-leading advertising agency.

As I have said, my talents would apply to both an account service or creative internship
programs. As an account service intern, I would be able to apply my previous job-experience
as well as my wealth of knowledge gained through Pi Sigma Epsilon. And as a creative intern,
my abilities and creative ingenuity would not dissapoint.

I am from the Des Moines area and attend the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls. I would be willing to travel just about anywhere if the opportunity is right. 

For my resume, just send me a message with an email address.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I've always used the CTA, but I decided I want a yearly or monthly parking permit for when friends/family come to visit so they can use it or for whenever I'll want to have my car for personal use. What would be the cheapest type of permit for me to obtain? Is it cool if I were to park my car down neighboring streets like Roscoe and Newport? I'd only use my car to get to my internship every few days, getting groceries, and getting home quicker and easier than riding the Metra.

You attend one of the world's most competitive universities, and you're on track to graduating near the top of your class with a business degree. You've got the brains and the people skills to solve problems and build relationships. It's clear that you're going to be a leader in the corporate world.

But all that hard work comes at a price. In high school, you never dated because, well, you simply never had the time. Once you got to college, any hopes of a crazy, wild party experience were dashed once you started studying calculus, philosophy, and corporate valuation.

I have applied to one position, which is *exactly* what I am looking for. It's a paid internship. I applied a week before christmas and have not heard back.

Here's the thing: I know I can kick ass. I need an intern-like position, but can't afford to work for free. Do you have any advice for how to stand out in the Austin advertising world given my situation? Are there any good ways to follow up for the job I have applied for?

“I wish I could say that this is the last time,” He said wryly, clear blue eyes betraying a sense of resentment.
	I took the folded wad of bills from his hands, mine shaking with embarrassment. “This is the last time. I’m just going through a rough patch, I promise I’ll pay you back once I book a few more gigs.”
	“You’re my son. You don’t have to pay me back.”
	“No, I sh-”
	“But,” He continued, “You still have obligations. I don’t think you can continue this…”
	“Work?”
	He glared. “Whatever it is, you can’t make a living out of it. You need steady a job.”
	“We’ve been over this too many times dad. I chose this, it’s what I want to do, and it’s totally possible for me to make a living out of this.”
	“If that was true, you wouldn’t be here right now, on your knees for rent money, of all things.”
	I fought the urge to roll my eyes. “Please don’t tell me that you were financially secure every single day since you started the business. I just need time to make a name for myself. It’ll pass, I promise.”
	He nodded, his mind obviously somewhere far away, his brow furrowed in frustration. “I’ll be waiting for that day, son.”
	I nodded, and walked away, head hanging down low. “It’ll be soon, dad.”
	An hour later, I walked into my cramped studio, carefully taking everything into account. Anyone would think it was an eight year old’s room- sequined jackets hanging on the wall, a row of top hats on a short wooden dresser with several false bottoms and secret compartments. There was glitter on the floor, near an array of fake limbs and brightly colored silk handkerchiefs. A cage the size of a small closet dominated the room, housing half a dozen pigeons- doves were far too expensive- that gently whistled sounds of welcome that turned into angry squawks as I harshly slammed the door behind me. I fell onto the lumpy mattress on the floor, closing my eyes, letting the dim hope that this was some elaborately long nightmare bloom in my mind.
	 Alas, reality quickly stepped back in as I heard the sharp click- the sound of the heating being shut off. A sound that equated to death in this weather. I groaned and rolled over, pulling the bed sheet around me like some makeshift blanket. I needed to pay for the electricity, or the birds would die. But if I paid for electricity, I’d have nothing for food. Then I would die, unless of course, I ate the birds. But then I’d have no birds, and I couldn’t do any shows. But, to hell with it, I didn’t have shows right now anyways. I might as well pay for heating and eat my pigeons in the comfort of my warm apartment. I stood up, and walked towards the cage. A pigeon hopped over, cocking it’s head to the left, looking at me inquisitively. It softly cooed, as if coaxing me to use it for the next gig.
	“Hard luck, bro. No shows for a while.” I wrapped my fingers around one of the wires of the cage. The bird rustled it’s feathers, and stood proudly on it’s plastic perch, stretching it’s wings. “No one to show off for but me. Choose your moments wisely.” I grabbed a knife from a jar on the floor, flashing it at the bird. It squawked and flew away, the sound of it’s wings like a gentle wave spilling across an empty shoreline. I stared at the blade, reflecting the soft light spilling in through dingy windows, twirling it around my fingers. 
	Then, I stabbed myself.
	I plunged the blade into the back of my wrist with full force. The front door swung open, a short, pudgy bald man striding through to where I stood.
	“Hey, listen up I got news- what the hell are you doing?”
	I smiled at him, pulling my wrist away from the handle of the knife. The retractable blade slowly swung back out, clean as it was a few minutes before.
	“It’s fake, Jerry,” I said, tossing it onto the floor with a sigh. “Just like everything else in this room.”
	He stared at me for a few moments. “Are you okay?”
	“Aside from the fact that I have no money for heating or electricity or cable or food or-”
	“I get it kid, you’re miserable, but do I have a way to fix that for you!”
	I perked up. “Yeah? A gig somewhere?”
	He looked down, slightly embarrassed. “Not exactly a gig. More like…an in.”
	“An in?”
	“Yes. Charity walk-around in the children’s hospital a few blocks down.”
	I exhaled in disappointment. “Jerry, I don’t have time to do charity shows. I’d be better off working part time at burger king so I can at least buy groceries.”
	“What?” He looked at me incredulously. “Where is your ambition? The kid I knew a few months ago would jump at a chance to guest star in some two-bit youtube video, and now you’re turning down performing at the largest children’s hospital on the east coast?”
	I sighed. “The kid a few months ago had a warm room and three meals a day.”
	He shook his head. “Look, it’s a charity thing but there’ll be some big players there. Guy that owns the theater off of 42nd street is running the thing, and his friends are gonna be there too. They see you doing good work, they’ll hire you. You have the equipment and the skill, and a woefully empty schedule, so you have nothing to lose.”	
	“I was thinking about selling my stuff, actually.”
	He let out an exasperated sigh, wringing his hands as if he could snatch the right words from thin air. “Look, just stop pitying yourself and get up. I pulled a lot of strings to get you that spot. So by this time tomorrow, you’re gonna have a couple of routines set up and we’re gonna head down there, and you will kill it, and get booked until next summer.”
	“I wish I could say that your enthusiasm was contagious.” I sat down on the mattress, head in my hands. “I just don’t feel it.”
	Jerry waddled forward, cautiously setting his own plump frame next to mine. “I know how it feels, trust me. You’re the magician. You know its all cheap tricks and flashy gimmicks. But those people- think of them. Kids that are surrounded by doctors and that nasty hospital stench all day, every day. They know people are lying to them, they know everything’s hopeless. And those doctors? They work a depressing, futile, nine to five job, stuck in burnt out marriages, over caffeinated and underslept. Interns that regret the fact they spent the last nine years in sweaty libraries learning a job that they know they’re going to hate. And then you’ll sweep in- you’ll do the impossible right under their eyes. It’ll be close enough for them to touch, these jaded people that think they’ve seen everything, will be on the floor in disbelief. Those kids’ll see that, and everything’s not so hopeless anymore. The impossible is possible. Those doctors will walk away, shaking their heads because the unexpected happened- that their day, did not go as they expected it to. They’ll have something to talk about over the dinner table with their wives, and a week from then they’ll still be trying to figure it out. Those interns will remember that they chose this job because they want to help people, to impact them. They’re all smug because they think they’re just like you- they make people’s day. Of course they’re not, you’re in another class altogether, but at least they’ll start doing their job right now. All that, because you did some stupid card trick that you’ve been doing since you were thirteen.” He stopped, and I could feel him looking at me through the corner of my eye. It hurt, because these same words would have moved me to go perform for hours on end a few months ago, but now, they hollowed me out, a reminder of what I could possibly do, if it wasn’t for the absolutely hopeless situation I was in now. I turned to him, his face cautiously optimistic and expectant, the same way he would look at a television screen in the last two minutes of a football game. He’d been the only one to support me, to push me to do this, and simply could not let him down. 
	“Yeah. Yeah, you’re right.” I said, nodding vigorously to hide the guilt on my face. “I’ll have an act ready by tomorrow.”
	He stood up, pleased with what his words had apparently brought on. “Good! I’ll pick you up at three. Email me a rough idea of your routines, and I might call you and help you set up some of the finer points. Remember, this is an opportunity!” He walked out, tipping his hat to me, a grin plastering his face. I managed a meek smile and waved him out.
	The light outside was waning, casting subtle shadows in the room that warned of little time to prepare. I forced myself to get up, and walked back towards the cage. The same pigeon as before cautiously hopped over in front of me.
	“Looks like we have a show after all.”

1. I've read a couple posts that suggest Certs over MAs and vice-versa. I can't figure out if the suggestion is ""If you don't have the time to get an MA, get a cert."" or whether it's just better to go for an intense cert right off the bat.

2. On that note, would it be beneficial to me to at some point in time work on getting a CELTA or some other TEFL/TESOL cert? Does it mean anything at all to have, say, both an MA TESOL and a CELTA? Or would that just be over-qualification and a money-sink? 

3. I'm also confused about the criticisms I've read about MAs, chiefly that MAs aren't the end-all-be-all because you don't have any classroom experience. I'm not sure whether or not my school wonks their program up or not, because there's a required amount of classroom time that you have to have before you get your degree, as well as an internship teaching requirement. So, I'm unsure where this ""you don't have any classroom time"" criticism is coming from unless my school just prepares its graduates better than others."

Why so expensive?,Shizzzler,Archaeology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/169una/fieldschools_why_so_expensive/,"So as a Belgian Master's student in archaeology I am once again looking for an internship this year. The last two years I have been working for a small museum in Finland, conducting excavations and generally participating as a part of the professional team.

This year I need to perform another 6 weeks of fieldwork at a location of my choice. Since I would like to broaden my horizons I have been on the lookout for a position in the UK, however it seems like all I can find are these fieldschools that charge outrageous amounts of money. Perhaps I am privileged as a Belgian student, but I only pay a tuition fee of 600€ a year and I don't intend to double that just to slave away somewhere. However, ranting is not of my concern in this topic.

Why is it that so many sites require steep tuition fees to have you work for them without getting any compensation? I am sure that even with the little experience I have I could be an asset to many excavations. Why is the trade between my hard work and their tuition so uneven?

TL;DR: why are archaeology students seemingly abused with these high tuition fees for voluntary labor?

169slj,1,2013-01-09,Questions concerning a regular fuck buddy...,thatgirlxxx,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/169slj/questions_concerning_a_regular_fuck_buddy/,"18F&amp;19M. I've been fuck buddies with this guy since many moons ago, but recently I just feel like I'm unwanted or that he's not interested in me anymore, or maybe I'm just getting frustrated with the vanillaness of everything. I know that it could be a plethora of things, and that I shouldn't really be so preoccupied with it considering we're just bumpin' uglies, not in a relationship. 

Basically when we started hooking up it would happen once or twice a week, which was awesome because I have such a high sex drive. Now I'm lucky if it happens once every two weeks or so. Not to mention that whenever I try to make plans, he's always 'busy', so it's always him that gets to choose when we bang. I use the term busy loosely because he's community college student working a minimum wage job and pretty much just parties all the time (not judging, but he has substantially more free time compared to my university work, internships, etc). I mean, I'll even try to entice him with sexy pictures or texts, but I'm lucky to even get a response to those :/ 

When we do hook up it's the same routine: hang out, watch some television, initiate foreplay, bang, rest for a bit, and part ways. Not to mention that every time we hook up he is either stoned/drunk, not that I have a problem with that. But, it makes me feel like he almost needs to be under the influence to get it off with me. He always has a list of excuses as to why I should always be on top (tired, drunk, etc.), and not that I don't like being in control, but sometimes I just want to be *taken.* Plus, I've been doling out the blowjobs like nobody's business, and have yet to be taken care of myself. 

I've tried communicating all these things with him, but to no avail. My best friend and sexual confidant tells me I should ditch his sorry ass and find someone new. But, I find him extremely attractive, funny, and a pretty good guy. ^Also ^his ^dong ^is ^like, ^perfect. Not to mention I'm kind of socially awkward and the chances of me finding a guy that lives this close to me, is this attractive, etc. are pretty slim. 

I'm not sure if I just needed to rant or whatever, but any advice would be appreciated. Thanks, pals!

**TL;DR:** Fuck buddies for a while, things have slowed down and become less awesome. Constantly shot down for plans, always giving way more than receiving, feel like he's uninterested. What do?"

John and I were working on the case in my office. It was weird not having Anna around. I was so desperately hoping that my suspicions were wrong, that she wasn’t dead, just hiding until the case was over or was taking a break. The office was cold, so cold we could see our breath. Neither of us really knew what to do about the whole Stitch thing.

We looked through the pictures, read the journals, and watched the tapes, God knows how many times. We would watch the tapes in slow-motion looking for any little clues that might tell us where to find him. But we couldn’t find anything. First, we were thinking he must be hiding somewhere outdoors. He always seemed sort of dirty and disheveled, like he didn’t have access to a shower and was always running around barefoot. But then we wondered, if he’s an outdoorsman, why is he naked? Doesn’t he get cold? Then we played around with the idea that he lived in a cave somewhere. Which would make sense – he’d have some warmth so he could wander around naked all he wanted. But it still didn’t quite work in our heads. Since when do supernatural creatures and serial killers not have homes and established lives outside of their murder sprees? Vampires, you think live in castles, mansions, and whatnot. Werewolves are only like that once a month, so they obviously have stuff to do the rest of the time, and have a house. Even zombies sort of have a home – their coffins until they rise from the dead. What would make Stitch want to be the outcast and not have a house and established life?

Nothing was making sense to us. Our heads hurt. Our coffee was running out. The sun was going down. The work week was coming to an end. Our options were running out. Thankfully no one else had been killed. But surely, it would happen again soon. Stitch wasn’t one to sit and do nothing for extended periods of time.

“What do you want to do?” I asked John as I stretched out my back. Before he could answer, the door to my office slammed open and an FBI team walked in.
“We need you two to come in for questioning,” the only one in a suit said. The rest of them were wearing the typical FBI uniforms, with their guns and everything. John and I were confused. What could we have done to catch the FBIs attention? We complied and went with the team willingly. We all walked out of the office quietly. My coworkers watched, just as confused as we were. Their eyes were all wide. Some of the mouthed words at me, asking what was going on. I just shrugged. I really had no idea. They shoved us into the back of a car and drove us to where they wanted to question us. 

We arrived at the jail in Downtown Seattle. It was a tan building with small windows with bars over them, so the prisoners couldn’t escape. I was scared. I looked over at John. He was squeezing his hands together; I could see they were sweaty. He had wide eyes, like he was a child caught stealing candy. My palms were sweaty too. I’m sure my eyes were just as wide. 

We were let out of the car. Two men grabbed both of my arms and pulled me into the building. I didn’t know what we’d done to deserve such harsh treatment. They didn’t give us time to look around the building, but I didn’t really mind. I’d been there countless times. I was just confused by why we were being brought there for questioning.

John and I were put into separate rooms. Each room had white walls, a white tile floor, a white ceiling, and a white light. There was a metal table in the middle of the room with chairs all around it. I was told to sit down and wait. So I did as I was told, in an attempt to stop the brutal treatment. The walls were entirely bare of everything, even texture. As I waited, I tried to find something to fix my eyes on. But I was so nervous I could hardly sit still. I tapped my feet and drummed my fingers and chewed my nails. What could I have possibly done? I’m just a detective! I’m the one who’s supposed to be solving the cases, not be a suspect or anything. Interrupting my thoughts, a man in a gray suit walks in with a file. He sits down across the table from me and just looks at me for what felt like an eternity.

“You’re probably wondering why we brought you and your intern in here,” he said. His voice was deep and scratchy. He had a bird’s nest type of hair, mostly white with shades of gray. His eyes were tired and old, like they’d seen everything to be seen. I nodded at him, unsure if I was allowed to speak.
“What do you know about…” He looks at his papers. “Repetitive Routine… What do you know about his death?”
“I know what happened on the tapes,” I said. “I have them back in my office if you want to see them.”
“We know what happened in the tapes,” the man said. “What do you know? Is there anything we should know that can’t be learned through the tapes?”
“What do you mean?” I asked. The bright light was making my headache worse.
“What did you have to do with it?”
“Nothing!” I said, shocked. “I didn’t kill him, if that’s what you’re asking. He offered to help us find Stitch and that’s what ended up happening. Stitch came and killed him. We didn’t think that would happen, but it did. And from that side of the webcam you can’t really do anything.” My speech got faster and faster as I kept talking. Was I really a suspect in his death? In my own investigation?
“Okay,” the man said. “Calm down. We’re just investigating his death.” That made me fume. That was my case. I didn’t work so hard to become the best detective in the Seattle PD just to have my case taken from me. Even if it was impossible to solve…

“You’re free to go,” the man said. “We’ll be in touch with any further information on his death.” I nodded at him and walked into the hall. As I waited in the hallway for John to come out from his interrogation, an idea crossed my mind. An illegal one, mind you, but an idea nonetheless. And despite its illegality, I decided to pursue it. I jogged down the hall to the man who’d questioned me and asked him where the nearest bathroom was. He pointed and said down the hall and around the corner. So I walked down the plain hallway and stood just around the corner, near the restroom. I peaked around to see the man go into a room with the folder, and come out without it. When the coast was clear, I snuck into the room, quietly so no one could hear. The room was dark and dank with file folders covering all the walls. The files were organized in alphabetical order so I found the J drawer and searched for my file. At last I found it. Johnson, Ryan. I opened it and found a small notebook. Flipping through it, the pages were covered in notes. I smiled to myself. Suddenly I head the door opened so I stuffed the notebook into my pocket and closed the drawer quickly and silently. A woman with sharp features and a stern expression walked in.

“What are you doing in here?” she asked.
“I was looking for the bathroom,” I said.
“Wrong room. It’s down the hall and around the corner,” she said.
“Okay, thank you,” I said. I walked out of the room and found John waiting at the end of the hall by the rooms we’d been questioned in. 

I swiftly walked to him and gestured for him to follow me quickly. We stepped out of the building into the crisp Seattle air. I kept walking until we were a good distance away from the building. Then I pulled the journal out of my pocket and showed it to John. He looked at me with concern.
“Did you steal that?” he asked. I nodded but didn’t care that he was worried. We were already in trouble. I flipped to the first page. It talked about how we were suspects in Repetitive Routine’s murder.
John Freeman and Ryan Johnson – present at time of crime, could have orchestrated it in ploy to solve serial killer case, follow after questioning.

That made both of us nervous. We looked around as soon as we read that, looking for suspicious cars. Cars of different colors and models whizzed around us, but nothing was standing still watching us. We felt small rain drops start to hit our heads and neck so we started walking and fast as we could to the office. The rain started to really pour and get us soaking wet before we reached our cars.

“I was thinking…we should go up to Anna’s parents house. She might be staying with them,” I told John.
“Let’s go now,” he said. “Why not? The sooner we find her the sooner we can let our minds ease.” I agreed with him and we both piled into my car. It was getting dark as I pulled out into traffic and eventually onto the freeway. The clouds were ominous. They were a dark gray. The rain was pounding on my car. John and I were silent the whole time. Neither of us knew what to say. We didn’t know what we were going to find. But both of us were praying to whatever God was out there, that we’d find Anna alive. A couple hours went by. The weather kept getting worse and the sun kept going further down until it was pitch black outside. That’s when I felt a bump and then it got really hard to drive all of a sudden. I pulled over to the side of the road and jumped out of my car. The front left tire was completely flat.

“Great!” I nearly screamed. “Just awesome.” John got out of the car and looked at the wheel. I ran my hand through my messy hair and sighed. It was already getting late and I didn’t want to deal with this. Especially given the situation. What if Stitch found us? I shoved those thoughts aside and tried to focus on fixing the wheel. I opened my trunk and found my spare wheel. But only a spare wheel. All my tools to fix it were gone. Nowhere to be found. How was I supposed to fix my stupid tire without tools? I nearly screamed again. I shut my trunk and leaned against the driver’s side door and waited for someone to drive by and help.

“You okay?” John asked after a while. We were both standing the pouring rain, in the dark, in the middle of nowhere. Neither of us were happy. Our suits were soaked; our hair looked like we’d just taken a shower; it was late; we were tired and stressed out. Things just weren’t looking good for us.
“What do you think?” I said. I wasn’t trying to sound rude, but I guess that was the vibe I put out because John scooted away from me a little bit and didn’t say anything else for a while. We waited in the rain for half an hour before a car finally stopped to help us. A man and a young woman got out of the car. The lady had long brown hair in a braid down her back and hippie like clothing. She had a kind face and walked towards us with welcoming arms.

“What happened?” she asked, sounding genuinely concerned.
“Flat tire,” John said. He sounded in a better mood than I was. Even if he had been acting strange lately, he was still more chipper than me. “We can’t find Ryan’s tools.”
“Oh, that’s terrible!” the woman said. “We have tools. Go help them change their tire, Josh!” The man she was with was tall and extremely muscular, to the point that it was kind of weird. He wore a plain white t-shirt and jeans. He didn’t seem like he would be dating the woman he was with – if they were dating, that is. He nodded in her direction and went to the trunk of their black car. Shortly thereafter he came back with the necessary tools and helped us change my tire. In just a few minutes we were ready to go.

“Thank you so much,” I said. “This really means a lot.”
“Oh, no problem at all,” the woman said, grinning. “Just one question though. What’s with the car with the two scary looking men in it back there? They’ve just been sitting there the whole time.” John and I looked back at the car and then back at each other. Neither of us had noticed it until she pointed it out. It was sleek and black, nearly unnoticeable in the dark from that distance. I thought on my feet.
“Oh, that’s the FBI. We’re detectives working on a case with them. It’s nothing to worry about.” It was something to worry about…
“Interesting!” the woman said. The man stood beside her silently the whole time they’d helped us. “Well good luck with your case!”
“Thank you. And again, thank you so much for the help.” I smiled at her and John and I got back into my car, thoroughly soaking wet.

“What should we do about them?” John said, pointing at the FBI car trailing us.
“Just let them do whatever. There’s nothing for us to hide; we didn’t do what they think we did,” I said. I started up the car and kept driving. John and I were silent the whole ride to Bellingham. The car kept trailing us all the way to Anna’s parent’s house. We tried acting like we didn’t see them. We tried to act as natural as we could. It was hard, but we did as good a job as possible.

Soon we pulled up to Anna’s parent’s house. It was a small little house just outside the city. They owned a little ranch with three horses. They were neighing in the barn a little ways from the house. They sounded panicked, but I didn’t know anything about horses, so for all I knew, that was what they sounded like all the time. John and I walked up to the front door of their shabby little house. Anna’s car was sitting outside. It had frost on the windows and what looked like fresh mud on the tires. Maybe she had just come back.

The paint on the house was peeling and the grass was unkempt. The stairs creaked as we walked up them onto the porch. I knocked on the door, but as I knocked it just opened. I pushed it further open and John and I walked in skeptically. The air was freezing cold and bugs were crawling on the ground. The first room we came to was the living room. The furniture had that typical old-lady pattern of canvas flowers. The furniture was covered in those plastic covers. The window next to the television was broken. Glass was all over the ground. The television was on. A news broadcaster’s voice rang through the silent house. It was eerie.

The floor creaked beneath our feet as we kept walking slowly through the house. We got to the kitchen. The fridge was open and the sink was running. Food was sitting on the counter like someone was about to prepare a meal. The food was rotting and there was a slight stench in the air. It was starting to get various colored mold on it. Flies buzzed around the plate, loving the stench of the disgusting food. John walked over to look at it. He winced a little.

“One of those flies just bit me,” he said. He poked at the food and a bunch of fruit flies jumped off the food on the table. We couldn’t tell what the food even was. The table was set and one of the chairs was pulled out from the table like someone was sitting there watching the other person cook. I started to see specks of blood on the floor as we kept walking. We followed the blood drops until they turned into trails of blood. Some places it was hard to make out on the brown carpet.

The trail led into a room that appeared to be an office, but also kept going down the hall.
We decided to go room by room and started in the office. It had a computer, printer and a desk with some cabinets. The blood trail went right past everything and up the wall. It stopped halfway to the ceiling. John told me to come over to where he was. I walked around the desk on the side where the chair was. The chair was covered in blood and so were the keyboard and the top of the desk. Some of the keys were missing from the keyboard, the monitor was completely broken and the mouse was hanging down, covered in blood. The damage and destruction of the desk area was not the most disturbing part. The worst part was, all over the keyboard. We found teeth. Like someone had gotten their face slammed into it repeatedly and their teeth had fallen out. They were white with yellowing at the top of them where they’d fallen out. The monitor still had glass around the frame. It was covered in blood and on one long shard of glass, there was an eye ball. It was brown and still had the veins attached to it. There was also some hair caught on glass on the side of the monitor. It was long, white, and sort of crinkly. 

At least I knew it wasn't Anna’s. I went to pull the chair out from the desk, and as I did, I heard a loud thump. I look down and there was a hand coming out from under the desk. John and I crouched down to have a better look. It was Anna’s mom.

She was curled up under the desk, her knees against her chest, sitting up. Her left eye was out of its socket, some teeth were missing as well and there were a few holes in her scalp where hair and skin should be. We could see the white bone of her cracked skull. Her right eye was still in its socket. It was swollen and black with bits of blood trickling down her pale white cheek. Her nose was severely broken. You could see the cracked bone beneath the crusted blood.  We decided not to touch the body continued down the hall way.

The blood trail was on the ground for a good five to six feet then it swerved to the left and went up the wall. We followed it on the wall until it came to a door. This door was locked and after several attempts to break it in with our shoulders, John kicked it in. It was Anna’s dad’s personal room - bachelor pad, if you will. It had a flat screen, computer, fish tank, various mounted animal heads, a gun cabinet and a cigar humidor. We didn't stay long in that room.

The first thing we saw was her dad’s body. He was ripped in half and replaced on the wall with his mounted bear head. His lower body was still standing up, right below him on the ground. On the wooden plaque, where it read the name, size and weight of the bear, someone had carved over it. It said ""Collateral"" and below that it said ""You can't run"". Maybe this will get those damn FBI agents to finally believe Stitch is real. Maybe this will get them off my back.

John and I went outside to find the FBI agents. They weren’t in their car so we assumed they were following us around the house. We turned to go back into the house and look for them and saw them coming towards us. Their guns were drawn but they weren’t pointing them at us.
“Do you believe us that Stitch is behind all this now?” I asked. “Do you believe we didn’t kill Repetitive Routine?”
“We don’t know what to think,” one man said. He scratched his head and rubbed his chin. “Maybe we should call the local authorities. They might have some insight on this couple. Maybe someone was out to get them. We’ll also call in more field agents. This might be beyond your control now, if what you’re telling me is true.”
“Didn’t you see what was written on the plaque? It was Stitch!” John said, getting flustered.
“Show us,” the second man said. We walked back into the house and tried not to look at the gore too much. We got Anna’s dad’s room and showed them the plaque. They looked at the words carefully.
“Collateral, huh?” the first man said. “Collateral for what?”
“We’re thinking he has my partner, Anna. She’s been missing for a little while now. We don’t know where she is,” I said.
“We definitely need to call the locals. We need all the help we can get.” The second man pulled out his phone and dialed 911. He told the operator about him being an FBI agent and needing back up. He asked for the address, I gave it to him, and we waited for the police to arrive.

“Maybe we should go check on the horses,” John said. “We don’t know how long these people have been dead. They might be needing food and whatnot.” We all agreed and walked back out into the cold. It might have been dark and freezing cold out, but it was a nice change to the disgusting sights inside the house. I loved the open field that lay between the house and the neighboring house. Although, it did remind me of the dream I had a couple days ago. 

As we walked further into the field, my heart began to beat faster. I found myself staring into the woods that surrounded the property. I can still hear that loud groaning sound from my dream. I know it was just a dream, but it still makes me nervous. We walked towards the barn quietly. Part of the thought maybe Stitch was waiting for me. The barn was like a typical horse barn. Red outside and stalls inside with open windows so the horses could get fresh air when they were inside. We opened the door. It squeaked loudly.

You could smell the stench of decay from 20 feet away from the barn. I doubt I was the only person who noticed it. All of the straw and hay on the ground of the barn was damp and stuck to the bottom of our shoes. It felt...gross...beneath my feet. I almost slipped a couple of times. The horses were in the back of the barn in the last three stalls. As we got closer, we noticed only 2 of them were alive and they were just skin and bone. You should see every bone in their body and their neighs sounded like they were in pain and scared and they could barely stand. Their legs were close to collapsing underneath them. As I checked them out, I noticed they had rope around their necks. Why would they have ropes around their necks?

When we found the horses, three more police men showed up.

“We were the closest officers to your location. We checked out the house and we called for more back up though,” one of the officers said, almost out of breathe.

“Oh my god... what is that smell?” another said. He put his hand over his nose and mouth.

“That's what we're here to find out,” I said.

I opened the stall where the third horse should have been. I wish I didn't. The only thing left in there was the scalp of the horse... It's whole mane and the horse tail was on the ground. The tail had a giant chunk of meat at the end, still connected, where someone ripped it off the horse. Next to these things on the ground...there were three of it's hooves.

“Jesus Christ! Where did the other hoof go?! Where did the body go?!” John yelled.

We all walked away from the stall and one of the FBI agents ordered another officer to take the two remaining horses out of the barn and take them to a veterinary clinic. As we opened the stall to one of the live horses, blood was everywhere. All over the horses feet, it's mouth and in its hair. We couldn't see any wounds or anything on him though.

Around the food trough, there were flies flying around it. I walked closer and my nose started to burn. There was a lot of meat in the trough. Some of the meat was still connected to bones. But... they didn't look like... human bones. They were much too long...much larger than human bones. The joints were different. The horses had been eating the third horse whose body we couldn't find. Who the fuck does this? I thought.

“Guys... I think I found the third horse...” I said, trying not to puke."

2. Should I go to grad school? I'm an English and Media student, but I'm not learning any specific skills, at least not related to advertising. 

3. Can I get an internship to learn the ropes? Or are they only looking for people who can actually work on the projects?

1. Traffic to and from the airport that weekend - landing on Saturday afternoon 5:30pm and leaving Tuesday at 6:30am. My brother is taking the train from NY - is it going to be nuts?

2. For the non-inauguration days, should we bother trying to get an early start on the day? Or will it be packed all day?

3. Should I be making reservations now for dinners, etc? Or will they have some special prixe fixe menu?

4. How do I get tickets to the parade? Or does anyone recommend a fun place to go watch inauguration activities where it isn't terribly crowded?

Thanks for the all the info, and I'm really excited to go back to DC!

My parents think that it's a waste of money. They wouldn't let me go on any class trips abroad in high school, and they were very against it. 

I'm in my senior year of college, and I'm debt free thanks to grants (my mother is very poor), and my father has paid for my housing for the past 3 years. I have found multiple universities that are priced exactly the same, or CHEAPER, than what I would be paying for my university.

I don't want to lose my relationship with my parents, but I am tired of living in the shadows of what I want to do. At most, I would have to take out a loan for the cost of housing (which wouldn't be more than $5000/semester). 

The only question I have is, is it foolish to do this my senior year? I've completed all of my classes in my major/university requirements, besides an internship. I can do the internship in the fall or the spring. i already have one lined up for the fall, but I'm sure I can move it to the spring. 

Do you think this is all a bad idea?"

169gk2,2,2013-01-09,[24/f] and S.O. [28/m] takes 0 initiative in just about anything.  What's the best way to express my disappointment?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/169gk2/24f_and_so_28m_takes_0_initiative_in_just_about/,"Background: We have been together for a year and he has lived with me and my mom for 8 months (we pay rent, but it is minimal and goes toward student loans she took out for me in undergrad).  We live in an expensive area and do not earn very much, plus I'm close to my mom, and SO and she get along well as well.  No issues there.


He was laid off about 3 years ago and has been working in a higher-end retail environment (where we both work) since.  He is full-time and it's a great company with decent benefits, but at the end of the day, his primary duties are things like customer service and rearranging displays.  I am part-time there, but in addition to that, I am in a weekend graduate program that I am doing well in, I have another job that I go in to whenever I need the money (although it's still where I make most of my annual pay), I freelance in the field I consider my career, I just working pro-bono on a pretty big project that is a big step up for me in terms of duties, connections, and title, and it is looking like I am also about to land a part-time internship in the industry that comes with a small monthly stipend, but it is also a huge step forward for what I want to do.  The things I am doing now are pretty much things that have worked for me in the past in furthering my career or things that we are encouraged to undertake in my program, even as volunteers/interns, so although I spend a lot of time at home on the computer and I make quite a bit less than him (~16k to his ~24k), I am also busting my ass to move forward; the vast majority of the time that I am at home on the computer, I am touching up my resume, looking up/applying to job opportunities, networking, etc.


S.O. is a fantastic guy and it is obvious that we will be married at some point in the future.  He is a good man, always tries to do the right thing, is gentle, affectionate, stable, considerate, and fun.  There is no issue with him being a ""moocher"" or any other concerns about financial fairness; he pays my health insurance, I pay his car insurance, I pay the most for groceries, he pays for me just about every time we go out.  It is pretty equitable.  

At work, he has a strong reputation at work as being one of the most hard-working people there, and has even started the process of being endorsed as a manager.  But work is pretty much the only place he takes initiative.  He basically doesn't give a shit about his health, and has a BMI of 33, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and sleep apnea.  Since we've been together, he's lost about 15 pounds, and his snoring/sleep apnea has improved quite a bit, and I think if he got to a healthy weight he wouldn't need his CPAP (which he hates).  When we got together he had just the worst fucking diet on the planet, and since moving in, he's gotten a bit better just because we don't Coke and chips and Hot Pockets in the house (we're not fanatics by any stretch of the imagination, but we all have high cholesterol and I know what it's like to be laid up with poor health, so I try to stay healthy).  But I know he's at McDonald's pretty much every day that I'm not with him (I find the wrappers in our trash can constantly).  He'll eat better and make an effort to keep up with his nutrition journal if I mention it, but if I don't, I can pretty much forget about it.


He hasn't done anything with going forward with his manager endorsement because his current manager is always ""busy"" and he doesn't want to bother him or go over his head, I guess.  Meanwhile, our mutual friend (same company) has had her endorsement started and completed, whereas he's been sitting on his for months.  He says he doesn't want to work retail forever, but when he comes home or has off days, he pretty much just reads or plays computer games.  If I ask him to submit some resumes, he will shoot off a couple to jobs I've sent him (that he has indicated interest in and asked me to forward him), but that whole process will take about 20-30 minutes, and then it's back to whatever else he does.  We have both discussed it and I plan to be the breadwinner, but at least initially, when we start having kids, I will need him to be employed so I can be with them while they are little.  Right now, I'm pretty sure that I will either be waiting a long time for kids (which he has said he would like), or that we will have an accident and he will be forced to quickly find some shitty desk job that he hates, neither of which are attractive options to me.


Anything that we do (activities, going to the gym, job fair, etc), we do because I initiated it.  He doesn't complain when we do these things, and even seems to enjoy them, but if I slack even a little, or if it's not my invitation, we simply won't do it.  Even with sex, if I don't initiate, we don't do it.  I have a bit higher sex drive than he has, although honestly, most of the time I initiate it's because I like being close to him rather than I'm revved up or anything.  He initiated a few times in the beginning, but throughout the relationship, it's mainly been me, which I'm generally fine with, but occasionally I'd like him to want to get something started too.


He has had some bad shit happen to him in his life and I know it sucks to be 28 and underemployed, so I have always kept the possibility of depression in my mind.  However, his level of motivation and initiative is the same on the months where we're physically active and taking vacations and meeting all other needs, as it is on the weeks where we sit around the house all day doing nothing and eating garbage.  If he is depressed, he is very consistently (and very subtly) depressed, although I have not ruled it out.


He's so wonderful in every other way, but it wrecks me to see him just not give a shit.  Again, basically nothing gets done (unless it involves food, which he absolutely loves), unless I ask, initiate, or do it myself.  For the most part, I don't mind doing the laundry and cleaning and making his dental and doctors appointments (which, by the way, he hadn't done in about ten years), but it feels like a punch in the gut to realize that if I wasn't around, he wouldn't be looking out for himself in the slightest.  I don't need him to be a millionaire or have a six pack, but I'm very afraid that he is going to die young, and before that, he's just going to flounder in life.  


I realize I've written a goddamn novel here but I just want some outside insight, because I've tried doing the gentle suggestions, I've tried doing stuff *with* him (inviting him to the job fair, gym, doctors...and since we've been together my eating habits have changed pretty drastically because I know if I slip up and get a kid's milkshake, he'll get a jumbo size), and nothing seems to really work.  I usually get up when he gets up (if he has a morning shift) to make him breakfast and pack his lunch, because otherwise he just stops at McDonald's or some other bullshit factory for breakfast and/or lunch.  I couldn't today because I had to leave for a job interview, and instead of making himself breakfast, he just went to McDonald's.  It breaks my heart absolutely every time he does that, and I've told him my concerns about his health and happiness, and he's so, so smart....but nothing seems to click for him, unless it's about something he's interested in (which tends to be things like how traffic patterns vary from region to region or what the best kind of yoke for a canoe is).  I don't know how to make him care about things that are just by his very nature out of his sphere of interests, but I need to find a loving way to tell him that he needs to grow up, and nothing I've tried so far works.  It's not anything I'd leave him over, but it still hurts a fucking lot.

**Edit**
Was kicking around including this because it's personal and I wasn't sure it was even relevant, but just for some additional background, his mom died when he was 18 and a freshman in college, and I know that after she passed, the house (mostly brothers) turned into a ""boar's nest"" (his words).  No cleaning, less emphasis on hygiene, eating habits completely disintegrated, etc.  His family is absolutely lovely and I know they were close (although he's a typical midwestern guy, so no real long emotional chats with them), so I suspect this might have something to do with the way things are now."

",endlessninja,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/169dz0/things_are_shit_im_going_to_vent_for_a_while/,"I'm in a dark place right now Reddit. I've spent the last few days awake, not eating, not doing anything to better my life. I'm just sitting watching movies or reading articles trying not to think. I've ran into depression before, but it always got better after a while. I'd take a few days off, chill with some friends, recognize the things in life that made me happy.

It's all darker now though. Since the beginning of December things have been getting progressively more shitty. The love of my life left me. It started as a break but I knew she just didn't want to hurt me. The other day she told me her feelings for me were just fading, and she wanted to be alone. I understand I'm more than likely to go through a few more relationships before I find the one. This isn't what's making me depressed, it's just the one thing that pushed me over the edge. Nevertheless, it still kills me to think about her. I haven't gone to class for a week just do I don't have to see her, standing there in the lobby, smiling and flirting. 

I'm lonely, and I'm so sure I have reason to be, but I am. Most of me and my ex's mutual friends have held on to her while letting me go. It hurts. Not saying I don't have friends, I have one who I cherish, and he's helped me a ton through these last few weeks. I miss intimacy with love. I could call someone right now and have a fun night. After the break up I went wild and tried to fill the hole in my heart with sex but it felt so empty and meaningless, and it was. It was a very bad decision. I miss being loved the way my ex loved me. She was so deeply in love with me, I couldn't believe it when she ended things. She always dropped hints for a promise ring, when I was going to ask her to prom, about her plans for us after high-school. It doesn't make sense why she left it all behind. It fucking sucks. I know I'm most likely going to get over it in the future, but right now, it really fucking sucks. It's been a month and it hasn't gone away. 

I can't stop thinking about what I'm going to do with my life and how not to be a failure. I used to have such high aspirations, now all I want is to graduate and work my ass off as a painter. I'm very smart, though I'm a terrible student. I love learning and being educated; I'll stay up until 3 in the morning reading about epigenetics and morality, but I can't bring myself to write a compare and contrast essay for English class.

When my parents broke up I wasn't sad; I was more frustrated things were going to be difficult. However as things went on I realized how it really affected me. My dad left me and my Mom $60,000 in debt, with a house being foreclosed and $12,000 of my college fund missing. I can't get mad at him though, I don't know why. It was a few years ago and I've forgave him. We work together now; we're sub-contractors, painters. We just work though. I ask to go out for dinner but it never happens. I ask to go camping, shooting, hunting, it never happens. He says it will, but never follows through. 

My dad just had a stroke and I don't think he's going to last much longer. There's a burst hot water pipe underneath my floor and it's causing insane amounts of mold. I have to find a new place to live next week. I've all interest in doing well at school. I dropped all my classes this semester, I'm going to try to start fresh at the end of the month. 

I'm very depressed, though I know I shouldn't be. It's understandable to be sad dealing with what's happening to me right now, but not this fucking depressed. Last Thursday it got really bad. I called my best friend and thanked him for everything he's done to help me and the last 12 years of friendship and then hung up the phone. I walked to the park a few blocks away from my house, across the ravine, and onto the train tracks. I sat next to them and waited for twenty minutes. I felt the ground shake and heard the noise coming from up the valley. I layed down, and put my head onto the tracks. I closed my eyes and hummed the misty mountains song from The Hobbit. I was just about to fucking do it and I don't know why I didn't. It was so close and so loud and I could feel the train in my bones and I sat up. I sat there as the train went right by me and I just fucking bawled. 

I don't want to die. I want to graduate, work, serve my country, go back to school, find a girl, marry her, have a family, build a house in the Yukon. I just fucking need these feelings to stop. I want to be completely numb. 

This runs in my family. I've stopped my Dad from killing himself. Growing up I always knew, he has a huge scar running from the inside of his elbow to his wrist. My cousin hung himself, my uncle taped a bag around his head and suffocated. Auntie's tried a hundred times. Everyone's tried at least once. Fucking genes. 

I'm going to have a meeting later today a Doctor. I want to get counselling, as long as the person's intelligent and actually helps. A few years ago they gave me some fucking intern who had me chose my current emotion from a piece of fucking paper with a bunch of smiley faces on it. I want to take medication. I'll do whatever it takes for these feelings to leave me the fuck alone.

No job, no money, no friends. mid 20's, Adhd, depression, anxiety, introvert. Living at home with mother and 2 sisters, its filled with garbage and junk, all counters and tables have no open space. Even the stove top is a place to store coupons, newspaper, and magazines the neighbors were throwing out. Even dirty paper plates get set next to the garbage instead of being put into the garbage. My mother works 3 jobs, and takes care of my eldest handicap sister. The other sister who lives here doesn't do anything to help keep the house nice, but adds to the mess since she picked up my mothers hording habits. The kitchen sink has a pile stacked higher then the faucet of dishes that wont get cleaned till probably next week. I do my part by cleaning the dishes and utensils I use right away. If I need to strain the water from my noodles, sometimes it requires me to use the upstairs bathroom sink.

I sit in my room(because it's clean) from when I wake till I fall asleep, talking to my family as minimal as possible. I would go hangout with the few remaining ""friends"" that I have that my parents are constantly telling me to hangout with, but that requires money for gas since only one of my ""friends"" are local. Invite them here? No one wants to visit this house, have you looked at it recently? I do have a few xbox friends, and I game with my cousin too, but they are only on at night.

But when I come home from basically working out for 6-8 hours, tired and stressed, I didn't enjoy having to clean the stove stop, finding the cleanest pot to clean, make food in a kitchen that has the stench of rotting food, week old bacon and pork grease, and a cup or two of milk that has been sitting out for a day or two. Well that didn't continue on for too long. With it being a challenge to make myself breakfast or dinner, I ended up eating once a day at work. Jimmy Johns, Subway, the hot food at Pick n' Save, or Piggly Wiggly, fast food is way too expensive. Now that I don't have a job, I have no money to go out and buy food, so I continue to eat as little as possible. Typically a frozen pizza at night, finish it the next day, the next night repeat.

""Didn't you try to save money and move out?"" Of course I tried. My job was a lot of work, and little pay. So when you have an income of $1000 a month, and $240-$260 goes to gas to work and friends, $240-$280 goes to fast food and restaurants, another $240 goes to cannabis. That's about 3/4 my paycheck. Then with Netflix, Xbl, a video game here and there, maybe a case of beer, and a hobby. That isn't much left to save. I even found someone to get an apartment with. That would of given me a clean place to live, where I could cook my own meals, and lunch for work. I would of lived close to work and friends to cut way back on buying gas. I sold my iMac for less then it was worth to get the money for the down payment. But with little income, you are required to get a co-signer. Who could cosign for me? My parents? Nope, they refused. With no co-signer, that apartment was quickly taken, and my apartment buddy disliked the other apartments in the area. By the time he finally did find one he liked, I was out of a job, and out of any chance of moving out.

""What if you stopped smoking /r/trees[1] ?"" Well this message would have never been written, I would have killed myself by now if I couldn't smoke. My family and friends of past pushed alcohol on me. That lead to severe depression, self cuts and burns. The only reason I smoked cannabis, after being told my whole life by friends and family how bad it is for me and that it's just as bad as coke and heroin, is because I planned on killing myself. I had it planned and all thought out, and was ready to off myself. Would it matter if I looked like a coke head if I was dead? Not to me. So I talked to some sketch people, got jipped a few times, then lucked out on some nice herb. That week I was a different person, I was happy, motivated, no anxiety, my finger nails grew past my finger tips! (first time since I was a child). Cannabis is what motivated me to getting that last job. That job got me a nice tan working outside, some buff arms, a muscular back, and then I found a great girlfriend. I have never been close to my parents, because of my poor relationship with my parents, I have always had trouble and really disliked talking to past gf's parents, or even any of my friends parents. But I connected with my last girlfriends parents. Tho I was in my 20's, it was fantastic to have a father figure, and a mother I could talk to. And their house!!! It was SO CLEAN! It was the prime of my life, I was motivated to get a place with the gf and my buddy, to lead a life with love and friends, my life was looking bright and I couldn't ask for anything better
But as time continued, having to live in this house continued to take its toll on my mental health. I started going into work late, then a day off here and there. Some days I just couldn't handle my depression. I went from seeing my gf from our usual twice a week, to not being able afford gas to see her that week. She eventually left me, and I can understand why.

""You haven't said anything about your father yet."" My parents divorced when I was 8. I could care less about my father. I could write 10,000 words on how pathetic he is. He is an active member of his church and hold a high rank in his Knights of Columbus club. He has canceled family vacations because he didn't want to have to bring his handicap daughter along. He finds excuses and reason for why he cannot come and help her if no one else can. Before any of his children turned 18, one by one he emptied our savings accounts into his pockets. I had to split live with both parents, and couldn't move out of my fathers till I was 18(court order). Once I turned 18 I was out of there because he was always putting me down for being a ""low grade"" student, and the control he needed to have on his children's life's. But I still talked to him here and there, he has a nice income, and my mother drowned herself in debt, and she is still sinking lower in it. If my car broke down, only person who I could ask for money was my father. After I lost my job I broke down in front of him, with tears pouring out of my eyes, I cried to him about how harsh my life has been, like being a target kid to be picked on and harassed all through grade school and high school, in and out of school. I cried to him how I wanted to end my life. He only sat there for a few minutes before he decided to leave, so we could talk ""when I was calmed down."" The next time I talked to him I realized he could care less. I asked him why he doesn't care, and with a few seconds of thinking, the exact first words out of his mouth were ""Well you don't ever come up to my house and help with chores.""
So with no support from either parent, no motivation for myself, no reason to take care of myself and my body, never a reason to leave the house, no cannabis to settle the stress, and my birthday a week away. If this is the life I will have to continue living, I can honestly say I don't want to make it to my birthday. An xbox friend has been saying that in 4-6 months I could move south west by him, he could get me a job working for him, and he could fit me into his apartment. It wouldn't be ideal for me, but it would be a step out of this house. But having to wait such a long time, if I don't make it to my b-day, how will I make it 4-6 months?

Well I guess I should get on with what I am looking for in life, and I guess what I am looking for is a lot. Since cannabis is the only medication that works for me(yes I have tried anti-depressant pills, keep them the fuck away from me please), I would love to live in a state where I could get my medication, I have looked a bunch into finding a way to move to Washington and would be a dream come true if I could live there, but living in any state with medical cannabis would be amazing. If I could also find a job or internship blowing glass, then I would be the happiest kid in town. I'm not into glass blowing because of marijuana, I have had an interest in glass blowing for a long time. Making something out of a lump of molten glass if fascinating to me, not just glass pipes, but any type of glass art, putting my imagination into a form. ""Degenerate Art"" was one of the coolest videos I have ever seen. Jackpot if I managed to find myself working in a dispensary. But I don't need the perfect job to be happy. I need a new place to live, surrounded by positive people, people I could call friends. It would be nice to have someone one to talk to, to have some social interaction.

But this all just a dream of hopes and wishes.
What else to say? It's a bit of a rant, I cut out a few parts, reddit doesn't need to know how pathetic I am. But thank you for who ever took the time to read this."

I read the ""BS/MS in Econ and looking for career advice"" thread but feel my situation merits its own post; also, that thread did not generate much discussion.

I'm in a bit of a peculiar spot.  I got my BA in econ in 2010 with a 3.41 GPA and a bland resume, and started on my econ PhD at a non-noteworthy university immediately after.  I'm in the third year of my PhD program now with a 3.69 GPA, and got my MS along the way.  Although I began my PhD intending to go the public policy/think tank route, I've been seduced by finance.  I feel cooped up in academia and yearn for a real job.  I don't care if the hours are long, as long as I'm building career skills.

My preferred area is something like risk management, pricing, research, or modeling, but really I would be thrilled with any position that requires thinking, isn't completely monotonous, and offers career growth opportunities.

I'm looking for summer internships as well as full-time positions.  (Although I'm still enrolled in school, I've taken all classes and exams, so I can work a full-time schedule at this point and do dissertation research on my own time.  If I land a good job that takes up all my time, I'm perfectly fine putting my PhD on hold.)  Primarily I am looking on indeed.com and going through my school's career services site which uses the Experience network.

My problem is that I've never really felt like PhD material, despite doing fine in my courses.  I've applied to associate/summer associate positions geared toward PhD candidates, but I'm not sure that my background is strong enough for those positions.  My math skills are decent -- and I enjoy math/quantitative reasoning -- but probably below average for a PhD student.  My computer skills are somewhat lacking; I can do basic stuff in Excel, and I would consider myself an intermediate R user, but very much a beginner with SAS and STATA, and zero exposure to any other programs.

I think I would do well in an analyst/summer analyst role, but typically banks seem to want undergrads for those positions and I'm worried that I may be overqualified or too old for those openings (24 yrs old).  I'm also not sure how employers would perceive this seemingly sudden career shift and desire for full-time employment despite not being finished with my PhD (although I do have my MS).  I have no prior finance/banking internship experience.

So that's where I'm at.  I will be grateful for any suggestions about how I can break into finance/banking.  Like I said, I am interested in any role that involves critical thinking and offers career growth prospects."

1693xw,7,2013-01-09,Are there any better financial choices I could be making?,concreteclam,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1693xw/are_there_any_better_financial_choices_i_could_be/,"Hello personalfinance,

As a quick background: I grew up in a low income household, dropped out of public school for various reasons, then took a string of minimum-wage paying jobs until I realized that I didn't want to do that for my entire life, and used the savings I had made so far to enroll in a local community college. I graduated a couple of years later with no debt but absolutely broke (very little financial support from my family).

From an internship I had at the community college, I landed a job that pays $48K a year with benefits and a pension plan. I have been working there for the past 3 years. At first I solely used public transit as I had no vehicle, but have since bought and paid off a small, cheap-running car (Toyota Yaris, $9k) that I use sparingly to get groceries, go out on weekends, etc.

I've made a monthly budget using Mint and put everything I don't use for necessities straight into a savings account. I try to save at least $1k a month and have accumulated about $17k so far. I pay about $880 a month for rent and utilities, including internet, cellphone, and electricity.

Does anyone have any suggestions or tips on anything else I could be doing to save or gain some more money? Feel free to ask if you need any more information."

I was hired into a healthcare environment as a help desk intern. I was told to monitor the help desk and fix basic windows issue, reset passwords, etc. Right after I was hired in, the two network admins quit, they hired one new one, but there were alot of duties not being done so I decided to get my feet wet. I handled enterprise backups, server installation, learned a bit about networking, a bit about sql, basically your general ""wear alot of hats"" IT work. This went on for nearly 2 years.

Also after I was hired the company got a new IT manager. When I was hired the company had the head of accounting working as an interim IT director, but for obvious reasons that wasn't working out. 

Last year saw a huge software implementation. I configured and installed more than half of the new hardware (despite this being the assigned job of one of the admins). Worked tons of overtime. Helped deploy the new servers, and incorporated the new backup systems for the new hardware. 

I should mention at that right after I was hired there was a 1 year pay freeze. I was hired at intern pay of $10 an hour. As of last year, after picking up tons of responsibility and 2 years with the company I had still had no raise. I brought this up multiple times to my manager, and she said we would address it after the software implementation. So I worked hard during the lead up to go live, worked a couple 90 hour weeks during go live, and have been on call about three weeks out of the month for the last year.

I finally got our meeting for the employee evaluation scheduled. went to it. And (drumroll please) $0.10 an hour raise. My world pretty much exploded. Between the huge blow that was and the stress the previous year had brought, I had developed some health problems, actually was rushed into surgery one day after nearly collapsing.

I'm back from my surgery now and have had plenty of recovery time to think about my situation. Basically I've been spending all this time working hard and getting practical experience at the cost of academic experience. I had to drop out of school to accomodate all the overtime and on call that I take around here. What I want to know is, Where do I go from here? I can barely afford to live on what I make currently, but theres alot of people in the IT job market right now and I feel like I have no skills that look pretty on a resume. Are there any quick certifications I can get, or am I not looking for a job correctly? Any advise would be great.

**tl;dr after two years and sacrificing school for a company, I have no degree, not sure what marketable skills I posess, and could make more money working at walmart. What should I do?**

We pretty much have everything sorted out, however we want to do something to a) make people want to visit our stall, and b) something for people to remember us by.

Most companies give out pens, key rings and blah blah blah, boring stuff! I want to thing of something unique and innovative that will make us stand out.

A bit of background on myself? No job, no money, no friends. mid 20's, Adhd, depression, anxiety, introvert. Living at home with mother and 2 sisters, its filled with garbage and junk, all counters and tables have no open space. Even the stove top is a place to store coupons, newspaper, and magazines the neighbors were throwing out. Even dirty paper plates get set next to the garbage instead of being put into the garbage.
My mother works 3 jobs, and takes care of my eldest handicap sister. The other sister who lives here doesn't do anything to help keep the house nice, but adds to the mess since she picked up my mothers hording habits. The kitchen sink has a pile stacked higher then the faucet of dishes that wont get cleaned till probably next week. I do my part by cleaning the dishes and utensils I use right away. If I need to strain the water from my noodles, sometimes it requires me to use the upstairs bathroom sink.

I sit in my room(because it's clean) from when I wake till I fall asleep, talking to my family as minimal as possible. I would go hangout with the few remaining ""friends"" that I have that my parents are constantly telling me to hangout with, but that requires money for gas since only one of my ""friends"" are local. Invite them here? No one wants to visit this house, have you looked at it recently? I do have a few xbox friends, and I game with my cousin too, but they are only on at night. And since I am the only one in this house that sleeps with their door closed, I get upset calls and texts for me to stop playing because I am too loud. Are their xbox mics that allow you to whisper in them?

""What about a job Timeelostt?"" Well I used to have a job I enjoyed. But when I come home from basically working out for 6-8 hours, tired and stressed, I didn't enjoy having to clean the stove stop, finding the cleanest pot to clean, make food in a kitchen that has the stench of rotting food, week old bacon and pork grease, and a cup or two of milk that has been sitting out for a day or two. Well that didn't continue on for too long. With it being a challenge to make myself breakfast or dinner, I ended up eating once a day at work.

168x9d,6,2013-01-09,How long is the main quest?,MrMocca,DragonsDogma,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonsDogma/comments/168x9d/how_long_is_the_main_quest/,"Hey guys, I first bought this game a few months ago, I read some reviews beforehand and I really couldn't get into it because every bad thing the reviews pointed out bugged me to no end. Things like the pawns not shutting the fuck up, which is still annoying but whatever. To things like the lack of fast travel, which is also still annoying but bearable atleast....

I decided to pick up the game a few days ago since my internship gave me a nice paycheck for christmas but while most things are still annoying, they just don't bother me as much as when I first started playing. Anyway, I was wondering how long the main quest was, I'm currently level 31(?) and I only just met with the duke. I finished up every quest aside from some escort quests before meeting him though.

I must say that I am using a guide. I am not using a guide to finish up the quests or looking where to go when on a quest, but I am using a guide to find out where I can find quests. I am a completionist, but some of the things in this game are just really hard to find. I mean after I reached Gran Soren I went back to Cassardis a couple of times and there were new quests there, who would have tought? Things like that I would have never found out on my own, because what game expects you to go back to the town you started in after I don't know how many hours of gameplay?

So yeah, how many hours is the main quest? Because when I play the main quest I actually feel immersed sort of, the cutscenes are great IMO and I love the way my character looks. Maybe because I managed to create myself in the game... Who knows. I just want this experience to last a fair bit longer. I plan on doing all the side quests ( The Hero achievement) so you can also take that into account. By the way is there any way to see how long I've actually played? I can just see how long the owners of other pawns have played. 

This game is also the first game in a long while (The previous probably being WoW back in the day) where I get really excited and laugh. I hired this amazing looking Warrior pawn the other day and I entered a cave. The cave had one of those trolls which go wild after he sees a woman, my main pawn being a woman he got a massive hard on and went HAM on my girl. This badass pawn which I hired clinged on to him, screamed something along the lines of: I'll attack him from above! and started wailing at him. My main pawn tought it would be a good idea to stand near a cliff, the beast charged, you gained 8000 exp, RIP Nostele the brave. I was also absolutely blown away when I came back from work one day and I saw my pawn had been hired by two people. As soon as I left Gran Soren and I tracked my quest she ran off screaming: I know where to go! I just tought that was fucking amazing, never seen anything like that in a game before. I can honestly see why this game is getting a lot of flack, even by avid RPG fans but if you manage to look past the bad things, which even turn out not to be THAT bad (Walking everywhere doesn't take up THAT much time), the game is truly amazing.

Also this game is the first game where I ever had a true sense of accomplishment. I beat Dark Souls not a week ago and that entire game was 'meh' difficulty wise to me. But when I faced my first Chimera(? Liongoatsnake) I was practically screaming with excitement because I expected him to be a breeze like in the prologue. But in the prologue you play as the Arisen at the end of his journey, mine was just starting and you could really tell.

Only thing that's bugged me thus far is the Metal golem quest. Mettle with metal? I figured you had to destroy the crystals, but there's one up in a tree which I can't hit being a mystic knight. My ranger pawn doesn't want to shoot it so I guess I'll have to switch to ranger. 


PS
Also, any of you have visually badass looking pawns? I'm not talking about midgets with high pitch voices, but badass warriors with gigantic armor. Or a ranger with a neat set. I just want visually cool pawns. 

PPS
If I hire a higher level pawn, will it gimp my game and make is super easy?"

I'm thankful there's a place to dump this... To the 2 of you that end up reading through it all thank you and please do leave some kind of comment, whether it's related to the post or not.

I'm an european bisexual girl on my 20s. I'm a social outcast, I've always been one as far as I remember, as early as in elementary school I never got along with other kids. I never liked playing their silly games, I'd be sitting alone somewhere in the school, hidden to make sure the annoying auxiliaries wouldn't come ""force"" me to play with the others. My parents put me on a psychiatrist after much insisting from the class teacher, his suggestion was to put me in a ""special school"". The prices were ridiculous, the issue was ignored.

Thankfully there was this family friend who always spent more time with me than my own family, he was a successful programmer, the geekiest geek you'd ever meet. He got my family our first computer, this was still in my 1st grade and it boggled my mind how it could all work, in an attempt to explain it to a 6 year old he also tried to teach me Visual Basic. It took off beautifully, he'd see me every single day and by the time I was 8 I had made a small game in VB entirely by myself. By the time I was 9-10 I knew english very very well, I could easily just use search engines to find things to read and learn. I took a special interest in web developing and web security from there. By 11 I literally hacked an international company's website with a SQL injection dumping all their tables. It was meaningless, it took a few days for them to fix it, but it was amazing. At 12 I got a few cool XSS accomplishments on popular websites from back then.

As a kid, as a teen and as an adult I've always hid behind a computer. Just learning and coding was the perfect distraction, it made me feel fulfilled and it gave me the reputation of a prodigy back then. Though the only reason I spent so much time on it is because I _needed_ a distraction. I don't remember much of elementary, all I remember is hating being there, spending every mandatory lunch break alone in my corner but then came middleschool, where there was this social gender separation and I wouldn't fit in anywhere. I wouldn't fit in with the other girls... and contrary to many, I wouldn't fit in with the boys either, this frustrated me, I couldn't stand being the lonely twat hiding somewhere in the school waiting for time to pass, I started doing really stupid stuff for attention. I'd steal my parent's beer, I started smoking, I lost my virginity at 12 years old to a 15yo kid who went on to brag about it to everyone and got a new ""girlfriend"" not two weeks after. I got a lot of disciplinary action done on me but the teachers would continuously claim that they see my pontential (given I was still one of the highest graded students in every year I did there) and forgive a lot of stupid things.

Eventually a class director on 8th through 9th grade took a special interest in me, she started acting like my personal therapist. Having hour-long sessions with me every week and often several times a week, she was trying to understand why I couldn't get along with anyone in class and why were there constant complaints about me. We never really got anywhere... In 9th grade I put a keylogger on school computers and got into everyone's e-mails and sent stupid mails to everyone on their contacts because why not. I also simply admitted it was me when people went looking for someone to point their fingers at. The director freaked out, somehow this was worse than all the sex and all the alcohol - this time she had the police in the school because some parents reported it over privacy concerns (I didn't even know you could do that), she was livid. She suspended me and I came back to school from the suspension limping. During the next meeting with her she was distant, she asked _me_ what she should do, she said, ""If I tell your parents anything then they either beat you up or forgive you. There's only so much I can do here."", I started crying uncontrollably as she went on with her rant. She got me a tissue, waited for me to calm down and then we left her office. Next meetings were removed from schedule and I never saw or talked to her again. She simply gave up on me, that was the first time I genuinely felt someone giving up on me.

At the age of 15 I got into an internship web developing, I impressed all the right people and this summer-thing became a ""paid internship"", after I got into a programming course to give the highschool equivalent I used the money they were paying me to run away from home and live by myself, I left a note, I don't think my parents ever called the police or bothered looking for me as I expected would happen. By the time I turned 16 I used the help of a friend to get emancipation and I turned the paid internship into a full-time job, moved out to somewhere else, started paying all my bills properly (though on a nasty neighbourhood), became completely independent. And highschool? It didn't suck as much as school had thus far. Sure, I was this very odd girl, also the youngest in this course, but now instead of not fitting anywhere I seemed to fit everywhere, I'd hang out with the punks, the nerds, the cool kids... I didn't make that many friendships but I didn't feel like an outcast for a while there, I got an amazing girlfriend and two amazing friends.

This was by far the happiest time ever and a time I'll always cherish, we'd gather almost daily to play Rock Band and the early Guitar Hero games, we'd all have SO much fun hanging out. Sometimes we'd put everything dark and run around the house scaring eachother, doing the kids stuff I never actually did in my childhood. I'm not putting enough emphasis in how much I loooved Rock Band and Guitar Hero, I'll spare anything that might identify me if there's anyone reading this far, but let's just say I went around the country winning nearly every single tournament, played on several leagues, got a sponsorship... Made decent money from playing these games while the genre lasted. Though I know it's frowned upon by much of the gaming community.

It didn't last long. The genre, that is, it officially died in 2011 but locally it had been dead for much longer than that. I'd still participate in some online leagues but it wasn't the same thing at all ever since GH3.

My happiness didn't last that long either. It's been a very long time yet this is still one of the first mentions of this happening to me. One miserable day a person I trusted invited me to hang out with him and his friends during the night. I never actually got to see or meet him, but where I was supposed to meet him were instead a group of punks who seemed to recognize me. Good ol' innocent me shrugged that off and decided to get back home, but those punks followed me through the streets, laughing as I walked faster. I'm not sure why I didn't run, maybe if I had ran from the first looks I got locked on me this would have been a much shorter story, I just walked fast, nervous. They start calling for my attention and I desperately ignore them until one grabs me by the arm, offended that I've been ignoring his calls, that it was disrespectful. I didn't utter a word, he drags me to an alley while his friends are on the back giggling and ~~it's quite surprising how many details I still remember but they won't be written here~~ he pushes me against a wall and forces himself on me, he tries to touch me everywhere and I quietly but desperately push his hands away every time he tries, I try pushing him away from me and he forces himself closer and tries to unbuckle my jeans' belt. I fight him for that and this time not so quietly, as I get more noisy one of his friends comes to help him, he pushes me against his friend while calling me a whore and telling me to be still and quiet, his friend grabs me by the arms and another one rushes quickly to try to cover my mouth and threaten me with a pocket knife. The guy in front of me goes back to taking off my belt, I still fought but the two of them hold me while he does it, they started with the jeans but they had fun getting me completely naked and I let them, I just stood there, I choked, I mean, I fought for a few mere seconds and then I allowed them to undress me, I even kept my arms raised when they took off the shirt, why didn't I scream? Why didn't I just fight the whole time, I hate myself for so many different reasons this night. I remember being so cold. They didn't do anything, not right away, they pushed me to a corner and started yelling at the last of his friend's who was just spectating, it was random shit in another language, I was freezing, I was curled up in the ground covering my private parts in so much cold, paralyzed, it didn't even occur to me to just try and run. No, I'd have rather been in the cold forever, the guy that undressed me quickly yelled to not cover myself while calling me names, I didn't even look at him, he came at me and I was just paralyzed, he hit me several times and then forced me to stand up, his friends all gathered around and pushed me hard against the wall, hard enough for a few sharp ends of that shitty building to leave scarring in my back as they did it repeatedly. They grab and raise my arms, undecided on how to hold me, and again, the same guy puts his hands between my legs and starts fingering me, it was just horribly painful, it was brutally cold. The friends trying to keep me grabbed and constantly pushing me against the wall just have their kicks beating me every time I instinctively moved anything or made any louder sound. Acting like primates. Until the guy in front of me finally stops, just to unbuckle his own belt and opening his trousers. They just took turns on me while calling me names and thanking me for being cooperative, they left me broken in that alley, no-one ever came to help, I had to get up on my own and head back home where I spit out incoherent text to a couple of close ""online friends"" through the pleasure of internet anonimity and didn't mention it to anyone else. I never saw that ""friend"" again, I never understood why either.

This was a long time ago, I dealt with it in my own way. The worst was the embarrassment. I wish I wasn't serious when I'm saying the worst about rape was not the act itself but how humiliated I feel, how ""inferiorized"". Especially for being so passive. Now that I look back, I didn't accept needing professional help but I did need it, I might've needed help my whole childhood too. But I never got it, I also never asked for it but I became more aggressive, less caring, I had poor social skills as it was, this new distrust in everyone did not help. I pushed away the few friends I had, I pushed away amazing relationships, I focused on my course though, and my job. That's what's important, to grow up and become a successful person. Once I finished the course I left my job with a huge amount of money left for rent and bills, to dedicate myself to university and a degree. But I had met someone just then, this amazing 11/10 girl, hot as all hell with a brutal personality that I wasn't sure fit with mine but it did work, I was having this feeling of genuine happiness again, I held on to it as hard as I could, once again I no longer felt the need to hide behind the computer in games, work and personal accomplishments. I could do whatever I wanted to feel good and I did. I think it's justified that given how miserable I felt for so long, that I was looking for some time with the exact opposite, I lost a few years of uni to make the most out of this, I don't think I regret it. Except in the end she repeatedly cheated on me and eventually dumped me for a _guy_ nearly two decades older and with my help destroyed my small social life in the process.

This is when the independent idiot takes a look at her bank account and realizes that the money I had saved from my job for uni is pretty much gone now. I went to live with a couple acquaintances, got a new job but not making quite enough money to be comfortable by myself. The only people in my life are those giving me a roof and I feel like a nuisance. Today I found that the same people that used to play GH with me from those amazing times in my teenage years, they're all with my ex. You see, when I started dating her I integrated her in my small social circle with a casual encounter. She loved it, so I kept planning something like that often, it became a thing. I stopped planning it when I broke up with her, my ""friends"" always cared for her a lot and I can't accept what she did, or really get my head around being cheated and dumped for someone of a different gender and generation, I feel so inferior, it's a thought I can't handle, I've gotten suicidal over this, I'm now a little more sane but I certainly can't really accept my ""friends"" to be okay with it and I just learned that these casual encounters I started years ago are still ongoing. It just became a thing to not tell or invite me."

I'm a sophomore at a large school in Maryland and I'm looking for advice on what to do next. I live right next to DC for reference.

I'm pursuing International Studies at my school. I'd like to work for the State Department or even become a diplomat someday. How do I get there from here? I'm planning on taking numerous language courses as well as studying abroad for a semester or two.

What should I do this summer? I tried applying for an internship at the State Department but I haven't heard yet from them (I'm assuming this means I didn't make the cut). If I can't find anything useful to intern for, I'm just going to continue at my menial job I work at on breaks, which doesn't add anything to my resume, but does bring me closer to paying off my college debt early.

If you don't think working for the State Department is realistic/a good idea, what would you guys recommend I pursue?

Thank you so much guys for your help!"

In march university starts up again and I am to go back to finish my degree, graduate next year, and enter a career in Engineering. Except... I'm not sure if that's what I want to do anymore. In the past 3 semesters or so I've been quite bored with the work and assignments and it doesn't feel like it's getting any better. I have a marginal interest in a couple of the papers I did this year, but the other 6 or so were very boring, and I found them extremely tedious. Now that I'm getting work experience within the field (or a part of it, at least) I'm getting the same feelings - parts of it are kinda interesting but a whole lot of it is boring, tedious work, and I'm not sure if it's the kind of work I want to do for the rest of my life.

So what else then? I've thought long and hard about studying medicine. It's a field that appeals to me in many ways - the sciences, helping people out, an immense intellectual challenge - but again, I'm not sure if it's what I want to do. It's a big choice to make - a medical degree here takes 6 years to attain, and then a lifetime of self improvement after that.

So I'm stuck. I have to start enrolling for classes within the next few weeks, and I'm not sure which path to go down. Any advice you can give me, redditors? And how did you figure out what your passions were?"

I feel like one of the hallmarks of being a man is not talking about your feelings, or about yourself in general. As such, I have a lot on my chest that I want to get off. Maybe there's a better subreddit for me to post to, but I've been following this subreddit for a while and you guys seem like a really supportive and welcoming group.

So I started dating my ex within the first month of college. She was my first girlfriend and for the first year everything was wonderful. Then over our first summer apart, we started to have some problems.  She tried to break up with me, and although I was able to talk her into keeping me, things were never the same. All throughout the Fall semester of our sophomore year, she started pulling away from me, and she became very depressed.  Of course, seeing her pull away only made me hold on tighter which is not the right response.  She was also having other issues at the time, but problems academically, and she felt like she had no friends. Suffice it to say, she was in a very bad place. We spent a lot of time together, but we didn't interact much. I'd stay over her place every night, but we'd only do sexual things once every two weeks or so.  When I confronted her about our lack of sex, she basically blamed it on me, she said I wasn't very good. She didn't mind, but she really didn't want to do anything with me.  So I accepted that. Then spring semester came, and she started feeling better. We started going out more (previous to that, we'd spend most weekends sitting home together despite the fact that I'm in a fraternity and there were always things we could go to), and things seemed to be turning around. Then she started criticizing me, my clothing choices (to be fair, I have horrible taste in clothes and it was pretty deserved), my sense of humor (I have a fairly dry sense of humor, people can rarely tell if I'm joking or not), my interactions with her friends (I'm fairly awkward, but I did try most of the time), and my choice of conversation topics (I tend to over think minute details of things and it would drive her crazy).  Eventually it came out that she was embarrassed of me, which is why she rarely wanted to have me do things with her and her friends, or generally go out in public with me. The only time I even had a shot of doing anything sexual with her was when we were both drunk, and even then it was only a 50/50 chance.  She tried to break up with me a few times, but I was always able to talk her out of it.  Even through all this, I loved her and I couldn't even think of being without her.  Then the summer came, and we were further apart than ever. The first time I saw her that summer, she came to visit me for a long weekend and it was terrible. She was in a bad mood to begin with, then I accidentally broke her laptop (it was breaking already, but I do feel terrible about that). Her bus home was in another day, and through the entire time, she was barely even willing to talk to me.  Needless to say, it was the awkwardest trip you could imagine.  It was then that I decided that I didn't think I could be with her long term. Before that, I just figured I had found the one and we would be together forever.  So later in the summer, I broke up with her. Cue things getting worse and worse for me.

Some background about my summer, I was working 40 hours a week at a job I hated, at school with is in the middle of nowhere. My job was in a kitchen so I tended to work nights and weekends, so I barely saw the people I'd been living with, who I wasn't very close with to begin with.  I also did research on the side for another 20 hours a week.  I was miserable, but I kept thinking to myself: as soon as school starts in the fall again I'll be happy. 

Then school started and I was starting a new major. It turns out my major is the hardest at my college, which is a fairly hard college to begin with.  I had always been a smart guy, and for the first time in my life, I was struggling to keep up. I was pulling all nighters once a week just to finish my homework, and worse yet, no one else in my classes seemed to be struggling at all.  Add on to that the fact that since I'd been dating my ex for the past two years, and essentially living and spending all of my time with her all of last year, I didn't have many friends to speak of, even in my frat house. Add all of this up, and you can tell that I was pretty miserable, but I sustained myself with the though that Winter break will be better. Ironically, I was going through almost exactly what my ex had gone through last year, but unlike her, I really wanted to pull somebody closer, but I don't know many people at school.  So I contacted my ex, and while I got no sympathy from her on what I'm going through, we ended up awkwardly on and off for half of the semester.  That ended around the beginning of November, and then after a little while I was ready to start talking to girls again, but it was Winter break.  

So I went home for winter break which I'm currently on. What I would want more than anything is to go out and try to meet a girl at home, just to get myself back into the swing of things, but that's not really a possibility at home.  I do have a better support system home than at school, but I've kind of lost my place in my group back home. For one, I kind of let them fall by the wayside. For another, I've kind of lost my place in the group. I was always the smart one, but I feel like such an idiot because of my classes.  I used to be funny, but I'm so unhappy that I can't really muster up any humor.  So when I see them, I don't really feel like I belong.  Once when we were drinking together, I started talking to one of my friends about my relationship with my ex and how lonely I am, and he had me practice talking to women with one of our female friends. But every five seconds I talked to her, he would shout ""WRONG"" and tell me why the way I was talking wouldn't make a woman interested in me.  His heart was in the right place, but it more made my confidence plummet than gave me practice.  At a later date, I heard him tell someone I was a depressing drunk. 

Now in this time, I have gotten closer to guys in my frat, just not close enough that I feel comfortable with sharing much of what I've written here.  And I feel so out of place with my home friends that I'm not comfortable talking to them about it.  When I talk about myself too much, I feel selfish and weak and so I don't talk about any of this.  I just feel kind of lost.  I don't feel like anyone I know gets me. I'm not happy at home, I'm not happy at school, I keep saying to myself ""well this situation right now sucks, but wait a few months and you'll be in a different situation and you'll be happier"", but I've stopped believing it. I don't have much faith that the future will bring good things to me.  I've been applying to internships, but I can't think of anything I would be happy doing for the rest of my life. I've been glorifying the idea of talking to women, but I don't even know what I would do if I found one that was interested in me.  My ex took all my confidence in my sexual ability, and while I'd like to practice and improve, the thought of how bad I am getting out would mortify me, so I'm made impotent by that thought (not literally).  (To be completely honest, I'm pretty sure the lack of sex had more to do with her depression than my lack of ability, because we were find for a year before that, but the thought does haunt me.)  More than that though, I just don't see why someone would be interested in me.  I don't feel like I have anything to offer to anyone.  This semester proved to me that I'm not smart, I don't have the capacity to be funny at the moment, I'm definitely not good looking. And while I am actively trying to improve all of those things, it's hard to see any progress.  They say you have to be happy with yourself before you're ready to be with someone else, but how do you become happy with yourself? I feel like I've been wallowing for so long, I want to get out of my rut. I go back to school this weekend, but I don't see how things will be any different.  

If you made it through all that, thank you for listening. Like I said, this is really one of the most supportive subreddits out there.  If I have to resort to pouring my guts out to a bunch of strangers over the internet, I'm glad it's you guys."

",AgonistAgent,circlejerkcopypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerkcopypasta/comments/168ihr/retrosrs_and_blackmailing_archangelledworkin_by/,"and blackmailing ArchangelleDworkin by uncovering the sweltering volcano of drama she had with gqbrielle after seducing her as well, through a PBS shoot.

gq and I had chatted for a while by modmail. I knew she wasn't as into men as I was into women, but I have sensitive eyes that rival a woman's, to the extent that I can even attempt to understand a woman's experience, because I can't. after picking at her name and using that as a springboard to talk about dresses, she invited me to a genderqueer fashion show.

it was glorious. we reveled in how much the androgynous models smashed the patriarchy, we sampled the raw foods vegan Hors d'oeuvres and we knew that this was truly the 21st century. progress, people.

I had noticed toward the end of the show that my hand was tugging on her waist. it wasn't even a conscious thing, and I felt bad because I didn't have her permission. I don't know if this makes me a tool of the patriarchy to say this, but her eyes seemed like she liked it. as much as I hate the idea, it was ... implied consent.

she was a surprisingly good kisser, and was impressed when I said I didn't think about masculine gender norms at all when I brushed the bangs of her hair intimately.

at her hotel room, we agreed to have tequila shots out of shooter glasses, even though we agreed that the phallic nature of shooter glasses is a little bit creepy. I wanted to comment on how I was impressed how much she could hold her liquor for a girl, but implying that girls have a natural capability to hold less liquor than men is a biotruth, so I didn't.

by 12:34AM we were leaning into each other a bit too much, and her shoulder knocked against my chest. we fell back on each other laughing, and I shot her a glance. not because I was objectifying her, but because I was considering all aspects of her humanity. it was incredible.

that's when, after a hiccup, she broke silence: ""that was good, now do this to AADworkin and find out what we can do to fire her. if you don't, I've recorded this whole thing, and I'll be sending it to various activists groups to let them know that you raped me.""

a false rape accusation. an MRA's worse nightmare, but I am not an MRA.

still, I was shocked how used I had been, that even after browsing /r/seduction in my shitlord ways she had known my game the whole time and made me feel like an AFC back in the days when the most I could get was an HB7. the hardest neg I've ever had to deal with in my life. if I believed in traditional masculinity, I'd say I felt emasculated.

the next day, when I put gq in my contacts, I found a couple of people who could set me up with PBS. it's good that I was able to get my blogs out on reddit, because PBS took me much more seriously after that, and allowed me to intern for them for the fall.

after telling them that I could do a follow-up story on reddit, PBS bought the idea. it wasn't long after that I had Dworkin, in the flesh, responding to my questions. I was uncomfortably attracted to her emotions.

We interviewed for a while, and I got to show her my androgynous side.  ""Maybe he's not as much of a shitlord as he seems,"" she mumbled in her coastie accent. After a while, my piercing yet understanding eyes that totally show I understand her humanity must have got to her. I asked her about her opinions on the direction of SRS, and that's when she said:

""well, you know, I really think there are some terrible people here, and I wish I could just fire certain moderators.""

I tried as best as I could to understand. I reached out a hand -- only with her consent of course -- and felt her palm tightly grasp mine for comfort. it was cold. something was clearly on her mind.

""i'd really like to get rid of gqbrielle and her gang, once and for all.""

this is what I had come here for.

""would it be too Elevatorgate if I asked you for coffee tomorrow?""

""it would, but I'll oblige you, shitlord. I kind of like you anyway.""

it was about 10:45PM and we went to a swank coffeehouse with couches clearly designed for couples. the wind outside had made both of our noses stiff with cold, so we huddled next to our coffee cups on a couch, embracing each other for warmth and for each other's company.

""you know, in spite of our disagreements, I've always found you attractive.""

""you're objectifying me FROM THE START? jesus christ I'm out of here.""

""no, no. I've found your ideas attractive.""

""uh huh. thanks. I have always enjoyed reading the stuff you write, even if I hate you.""

we conversed like this -- half-hating, half-flirting -- until 12:05AM. I get a text from gq:

""if you don't get her back to the hotel room, you'll have a lot more to worry about than transparency.""

freaking out, but determined not to show it, I invited Dworkin back to the same hotel room gq and I were in.

Dworkin was considerably more resistant to the idea of consuming alcohol. champagne flutes? phallic. a margarita glass? gendered, it needs a stem to be held up by women. we eventually settled on martinis in those stemless wine glasses.

""if you found me physically attractive, it wouldn't be objectifying.""

""why?""

""because I'm giving you my consent. jesus christ you're thick. fuck me already.""

in a rush of passion, we threw the glasses on the floor. for someone who thinks I am a cissexist piece of shit, her body was remarkably... cisgendered.

12:45. we had just finished, our breaths exchanging such that my inhale was timed to her exhale. I had slept with a lot of women, thanks to my /r/seduction past, but none I found as attractive as her at that moment. there was a kind of beauty to how she tastefully defied gender norms, such as having armpit hair but not too much, or unshaven legs but not really in an extreme way.

12:57. we are sweatily embraced, and I hear a crash.

gq had been equipping herself in the bathroom. she had kicked open the door and was pointing a gun at me and Dworkin.

""I have pictures of both of you. and if you don't bring both of your cissexist shitholes to the ground, I will kill both of you on sight.""

we nervously put our clothes back on, and never spoke of the moment since.

ever since then, I've been wondering what was going through dworkin's mind when she made those SRS decisions. surely she remembers the beating of our hearts as gq's finger caressed the trigger. but we haven't talked about it. not once.

out of respect.

I'll wait for my death patiently.

I'm in the worst part of my life right now. I quit my internship last week and I also quit my studies. I was at university studying to be a software engineer, but the truth is that I hate desk work. 

I have a serious issues with social anxiety and this illness as taken lots of thing from my life. I started software engineering because I though I wouldn't have to deal so much with my anxiety problems, but guess what, sadness is even worse then anxiety. I have a lot of debts and I need to find another job quickly. 

I just don't think I'm able to work. I think I'm worthless, I think I'll be sad and depressed for the rest of my life. I don't know what I love anymore and life have no taste at all from my point of view. 

I wanted to backpack around the world, I wanted to be an artist, but I  never developed any talent. I want to help people, I want to put a smile on people's faces. I'm so petrified by this damn mental condition, I feel worthless in every situation, I think everything is my fault all the time. I still live with my parents who are on the verge of kicking me out. I know they love me and they are the only reason I'm still alive, because I'd kill myself otherwise. 

I feel like shit every single day. The girl I love doesn't love me back and all my friends are getting their lives together. 

I'm not looking for anything particular by posting this, I need to vent, I need advices, I need to know I'm not alone, whatever will do, because right now I am lost and my world is empty. I also know that I just puked everything I had without much information, but right now I'm not thinking too much, I'm just typing whatever comes to my mind.

168f11,0,2013-01-09,"Need some guidance. Thinking about Chemistry + Computer Science double, while doing premed",ilovedumbpeople,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/168f11/need_some_guidance_thinking_about_chemistry/,"I'm in a very interesting scenario. I am both very interested in Chemistry and Computer Science, and am considering getting BS degrees in both. I am a current freshman. My first semester GPA came out to be above a 3.9, and am taking organic chemistry this year (got an A first semester). 

My scenario is interesting because I actually took a lot of my premed requirements (all the math, General Bio + Lab, Gen Chem + Lab, Gen Phys + Lab) while I was in high school from another university, and I counted the credits as ""college credit only."" What I'm told is that this satisfies the requirements of medical schools, even though I'm not taking them at my current college. 

So, what would you guys suggest? Is double majoring possible? What classes should I take besides the ones that are technically required by med schools? Should I retake my med school requirements in order to get into a better med school, or will they look at my (hopefully) good grades in higher level bio/chem courses and (hopefully) good MCAT scores and think that it's enough? Should I start looking for labs right now (already kind of know the answer to this one)? Will med schools frown upon internships at tech companies during the summers of sophomore and junior year rather than research? I have many resources available to me from my university, so any suggestions are welcome.

Thanks!

I don't know what I want, I just hope somebody can lend me a kind word and a way to stay positive. 

I was supposed to graduate college last spring. That didn't happen because I fucked up some classes, and needed an extra semester to finish up. Everything looked like it would still be ok, though. I got a summer internship, and I was supposed to go back to school in the fall. But that couldn't happen. My father, who paid for my schooling, lost everything. He was self employed too. That means that now he is unemployed. I can't get a student loan because he is the only person I know who would be willing to cosign a loan for me, but his credit isn't worth anything because he hasn't had income in 2 years now. We were hoping that things would turn around by this time, but they haven't, and now I will not be going back to school in spring, either. I would take cheaper classes somewhere else and get transfer credits, but my school doesn't accept transfer credits from, like, anywhere. I can work for the time being, but its starting to look like I'll never graduate from my school, which I busted my ass to get into in highschool and have busted my ass through for 4 years (I still didn't do phenomenally. I'm just barely smart enough for my university, and the classes kick my ass). But here's the thing. I would be able to cope with all of this stuff. I'm dying though because of my girlfriend. I'm absolutely in love with her. We've been together for two years now, and she has been a real trooper through all of this shit, but I can tell she can't hang in much longer. I feel like crap for putting her through this. She gets mad at me for not being able to do anything about it. The fact is though, I owe the school $10,000, and another semester would be $26,000 more. My current balance is $112. The best job I could get would pay me 12/hour. My grades aren't good enough for a scholarship. I'm fucked. And she is gonna leave me. And I don't blame her. My family is in a downward spiral and she is getting tied into it. We had such great plans for our life together, but they are impossible now. I couldn't bare to lose her, and I know I'm going to. I feel absolutely helpless. Eight years of trajectory into a life I had planned for, and now nothing I have worked to achieve will ever happen. I know I'm young, and theres a long life ahead of me, but that isn't comforting. Its the opposite. I feel like I'm facing a lifetime of misery, wishing I had done better in school to get scholorships, dreaming about what could have been if my father would have been able to support me just that little bit more, missing the hell out of the love of my life, hoping for some stroke of luck that will never occur. I feel like I've enjoyed all the happiness allotted to me, and now I'm just going to wallow in misery until I die. I'll probably dedicate myself to helping others or something, but fuck. I just can't believe how things just turned upside-down. I can't imagine ever being happy so long as I can't be with her. I've felt fake love before, and I know this isn't it. I love this girl, and I'm hurting her by asking her to stay with me. She has so much potential and can do so much with her life if she leaves me. I'm just dragging her down and it hurts me so much to see it. What the hell can I do? I don't feel like I can control any of this shit-storm that has become my life. What midset can I assume to better cope, or even overcome? I need help."

**UPDATE: [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/16bsub/so_i_left_heres_how_it_went_down/)**

**TL;DR = I hate my role as the 1 man IT department and feel I'm overworked, and none of my pleas for help (people or tech) go answered for over a year.  I'm burnt out and my new 'manager' knows nothing about tech, or IT/support roles, and is doubting I do anything because there are still some open tickets for ongoing projects.  Do I rage quit? or bite down and play nice and 'man up'?**

And the full rant... 

I'm so pissed right now and my apologies if that comes out here.  I'm going to try and lay this out here in a way avoiding ID of me or my current employer.

I am the Network and Systems Admin for the company in title but in practice I am the one man IT department.  When I took the job, I knew I was getting into that role and with the size of the company it was quite manageable.  The company has now doubled, if not nearly trippled in size (including merging with another small company) and now spreads over MULTIPLE offices around the midwest US, and overseas sales staff that are operating on all time zones pretty much.

I am on-call 24/7.  Literally.  I am the only one and they all have my direct cell and while I accept 'mission critical' calls are par for the course, I get the ""my printer is beeping at me"" calls at 3:20 am just the same.

I manage everything from reloading printer paper at the office I am based in, to troubleshooting phone lines, over the phone, with people who don't know the difference between a busy tone and a dialtone, across the country.  I also manage the Cisco and HP network devices, and am expected to administer multiple Linux boxes running KVM, with multiple (too many sometimes) KMV guests.  

I am expected to document everything.  I do not feel shocked at that expectation as it's good practice for everything IT, but... I am expected to document everything I do, as I do it (get to that in a second), as well as retro actively document the 5+ years of things they've set up before I was even hired!  I am also expected to document it in such a way that ""anyone in the company can open a PDF and do what you do.""  Basically a how-to for everything, up to and including (this was a real request), configuring a Cisco ASA firewall... written for someone who doesn't even know how to ssh or what a firewall is.  Back to the ""at the time you do it"" rule.  I am often doing MULTIPLE tasks at once and rarely ever get more than 15 minutes straight without someone dragging me into another discussion that probably shouldn't even involve me, but hey, it involves a computer or a file so... IT right?  I rarely get the time to go back and close out the ticket I just completed work on, before I am dragged away to another thing... and I rarely get the chance to open, fill out, and then close a ticket, for many of the things (most things) when people just walk up to my desk (the front of the whole office so everyone can get to me instantly), give me a problem, and need a resolution right then and there.

On that... I'm at the front of the office.  For fuck's sake.  The UPS guy has ME sign for everything and asks me if we have shit to pick up.  Fedex too.  Postoffice dude comes in, drops mail on my desk, goes out.  I'm closer to the front door than the people who answer the phones, deal with mail, and UPS/FedEx.  This not an issue for anyone it seems.

I have been with the company over a year now, as the only IT person.  The only assistance offered is whatever lowly 'intern' they have hired to help with 'random office things' for that period of time.  For that persons time though, I have to queue up along with everyone else in the office who wants assistance answering phones or filing paper or scheduling meetings for them so they dont have to.  These people also NEVER have any IT skills, so all I can have them do if I get time with them is tell them to update a spread sheet with numbers (file sizes) they find on various network drives.  That's all.

I have personally installed 2 full racks in 2 locations for them with servers, NAS, network, VPN, spares, etc.  I am the only person with access to 1 of those which is 2 hours away from my home office, and no one else is willing to get access so that if anything ever happens, I  alone have to drive to the datacenter to flip a switch or console into a server when a dev turns eth0 off.

We also deal with media quite a bit, and we have multiple people who are geniuses with Adobe products.  I am tasked with managing all of the 'licenses' (very very grey area in some cases, if not just pirated), and the workstations they run on.  I am also tasked with keeping a 40TB Netapp from being full.  38TB they need to retain there ""just in case"".  So I am constantly copying 2TB off to external drives for off-site storage, and by the time I get it open for another project to fit on, they fill it back up and yell or open tickets ""NETAPP IS FULL!!! HORRIBLE DISASTER!! NO WORK CAN BE DONE!!!""  They refuse to buy more disk space for the netapp, or alternate large storage solutions for quicker offload of data.

Now, they have decided that I am using my time inefficiently, which I totally agree with.  I have no idea how to 'effeciently' keep up with the level of demands placed on me.  Their solution however is not to bring it another IT skilled person to balance the loads and work beside me, but to assign the office manager to be my boss because ""she's good at schedule everyone's time"".  ie: she makes the meeting calendar.

I have a ticketing system.  No one opened a ticket for the first 4 months it was up and running.  No one.  Everyone called me directly and no matter what I did they didn't get it.  Not until I had to tell the CEO to open a ticket 5 times in a call did he get the message and then make a note about it for everyone.  He still never opens tickets but that's what it is, he's the main man.  Now I get tickets for ""My mouse needs cleaning"", or ""Our site is giving php error code... ""  I am expected to clean mice balls, and replace mousepads, or hand them out.  I am expected also to apparently PROVE that a PHP error code in our products is NOT the fault of the Linux server it's running on, before I am allowed to have a dev look into it.  

Just tonight, sitting here installing a VM for our Oracle guy because he'd rather have a ""clean slate"" than upgrade his current VM's oracle with a patch... I have gotten an email telling me that I have failed to close all of my completed tickets in the past few weeks, and there is now reason to suspect I have spent 3 weeks doing nothing.

3 weeks, of a one man IT shop, doing nothing... the place would be burned down.  But, there's reason to doubt that I've been doing anything?  Really.

I emailed the CTO, my direct boss, who's been avoiding being ANYTHING of a manager to me for my entire time with the company up to the past few weeks, and who had repeatedly shot down requests for a) more IT help, b) more storage options, c) developers to look at site errors instead of me, d) meetings to keep us both on the same path with IT needs... I told him I need to know if HE personally has any reason to doubt my abilities and efforts, and if so HE needs to tell me, not this office manager (in an email she CC'd to him, the president, and the CEO, none of which have mentioned any concerns to me directly).

Oh and fucking vacation time.  I haven't had a vacation since I started. They have a ""strict, not strict"" vacation policy.  ""as long as work gets done when it needs to get done, take whatever vacation you need"".  There is no written policy.  No accumulated days.  No anything.  People just say ""I'm out from now til then.""  However, I am IT.  We are a tech company.  I am always on call.  There is always something relating to some type of technology that needs to be looked at.  The only 'vacations' I have gotten, is the drive time across the midwest to go from office to office now and then to work at differnet places for a week at a time.  Seriously, they consider that vacation, or 'personal time'.

I am fucking tired of this.  I'm tired.  I'm just fucking beat down by all of it.  I think most of the people in this company are fucking awesome and great at what they do, the other 1/3rd are all college friends that came along with the CEO when he made the place so they're untouchable and I'm just tired of getting slammed with multiple offices, remote users, everything from piddly shit to being the 1 person on high fucking alert during Sandy's landfall.  I'm just fucking tired.  I'm not personally invested in the company like my superiors are, and not guaranteed anything if they do sell, or we strike fucking industry gold or anything.  I'm just getting my paycheck (about 80k) and that's it.


I want to quit.  I want to clean out my fucking personal shit tonight, drive home, and fucking email them a ""good luck with that shit"" letter in the morning and never go back.  Okay, maybe hand them a formally typed letter and say ""sorry, it's just not working out."" in the morning and then go home, but what the fuck ever.  

Now, I ask you guys, from what I rambled here, does it sound like 1 IT person should be handling this kind of load on their own?  Does it sound like I'm just ""not realizing my true potential""?   Should I bit the fucking bullet and nod and play nice and wait for .. what?

I am already taking phone interviews, and look to get more when I bump my resumes.  Meant to do that this week actually but I have had to do lots of last minute ""we forgot to do this, could you look at it..."" shit for the DBA's and Dev's.  I am also at this point willing to work outside IT if it comes to that again.

If no one can, then I'm probably in my last 12 hours of being part of this company.  And in that case, how do I deal with this going forward, eg resume?

168ccx,9,2013-01-08,How should I properly set myself up for future jobs?,ragnvaldr2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/168ccx/how_should_i_properly_set_myself_up_for_future/,"I'll give the TL;DR first, because I'm afraid I'll let the full story get too long.  
**TL;DR:**  
* 22, No college degree, getting married in 3 months   
* No previous experience  
* Self taught--and it shows...poorly  
* My job isn't giving me useful experience, and I doubt ever will ever will  
* Would really like to get into software engineering, but am very lost and directionless  

Background: I'm 22, and live in southern California. I took enough community college to transfer to a UC/CSU, but never actually did so.   Instead, I took a full-time job offer at a company I was working at part-time. I'm also about to be married in 3 months, and both my fiancee and I make $30k, pre-tax, which is barely enough to scrape by where we are.  
  

The company I work for is a mostly family run, non-profit, movie review business. And I might add, it's a **very** poorly run company, and with the possible exception of my immediate boss, I'm the most qualified to do their IT--which is scary. A total of about 12 people in the office, plus another 6-12 in different areas. I was originally hired to do data entry, learn how to use their production printer, and generally just be smart enough to fix things and solve problems. I've grown up with computers, and have a number of years learning and fixing things, but didn't start getting a deep understand until fairly recently--still don't have near as deep of an understanding as I'd like.

  
When I was given the full-time offer, they made promises of teaching me programming and having me **just**  be a programmer that didn't quite end up as planned.  

That was a year ago, and I still only know enough HTML and CSS to get by, and a bit of javascript, and I'm still little more than the office grunt doing little jobs that everyone else can't be troubled to do. Every now and then I'll have to set up some new little website in rackspace and stick a WP theme on it (and try to customize it a little,) but that's hardly something I can put on a resume.  
Just today I was asked to make a ""piss simple"" app for them that basically just is a news feed of all our website's content (new articles, reviews, etc,) using something like Titanium, since it's JS, and though I feel like that's getting closer to what I'd like to do, I feel like it's not something I realistically *can* do yet.

I try to fit in some time to learn more, but there's not enough time to focus on it. Mostly codecademy (almost finished all the JS courses) and some Lynda.com. At home, on the side, I'm starting to go through C++ Primer.

What I'd really like to get into is software, I think mobile in particular. ...But I have no experience. And no one to teach me. And while I know there are unlimited resources online to teach myself, I feel like I'll be missing out on a lot not having someone guiding my curriculum or being able to explain certain things that I'd otherwise miss. 

So I think what I'd most like is to find a job where I can start out low (preferably making at least what I am now...) but somewhere where I have someone to teach me as I go. Or even a mythical paid internship would be great. 

I've looked at colleges, but the local school, CSUCI, doesn't have a night/online CS program, and I couldn't find a decent looking and affordable program anywhere online either.  
I'm also open to moving--my fiancee is at a job she'd like to leave as well, and we're both up for moving around a little for work if need be.

I'm sorry if this is the same old story you guys hear in here, and I'm sorry for the horribly long post, but any advice would do wonders for this desperate man. I feel like if I don't do something soon, I'll be paying for it dearly in the long term."
168a1n,4,2013-01-08,"Need advice figuring out how to get anywhere in video games. Suddenly don't know what I want anymore. (long post, contains tl;dr)",arcturin,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/168a1n/need_advice_figuring_out_how_to_get_anywhere_in/,"TL;DR: Moved to LA 1.5 years ago to get into video game audio. After a job at Starbucks and another for a film composer, I haven't gotten anywhere in video games. Don't know what to do anymore, because all my effort seems wasted.

Ever since I thought about what job I'd like to be doing for the rest of my life, I've been sure I'd want it to be in video games. I first got the idea in my first year of college - completed a double major at Berklee College of Music, and graduated August 2011, ahead of schedule. I love writing music and working with sound. It is my passion, and the only other thing that I have the same love for is video games. So, after connecting the dots, I started studying video game sound design.

After college, I moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in video game audio. After two unpaid internships, a lot of effort, and a few small paid projects providing music and sound for video games, I ended up working at a Starbucks to make ends meet. This went for six months, and I was left with little time to pursue my passions and started wondering what I was doing with my life. In late October, I got an email about a major film composer looking for a new assistant. I applied for it, and after a few emails, an interview, and less than 24 hours, I had been hired. I was so happy I cried. I don't think I've ever done that before.

Very quickly, I began to learn that the life of a composer's assistant is not one I want to lead. Constant 10-16 hour days left me exhausted, and I felt like the work was taking its toll on my soul - I didn't emotionally connect with any of it. I started making mistakes. Nothing major, just occasionally forgetting one thing or another. But it was still more than enough to annoy my boss to the point of firing me right before I flew home for Christmas. I had a bit of a mental breakdown the night beforehand (the job was really getting to me in a number of ways), so losing my job didn't unnerve me too much.

The entire time I've been in LA, even during my time as a composer's assistant, I've wanted to music and sound for video games. I got the opportunity to attend GDC 2012, I met/interviewed people from Activision, Infinity Ward, Riot Games and more, I've happily stayed current with what video games are hot (indie and AAA alike), and so on. After everything I've done, I've felt like I haven't gotten anywhere towards getting hired fulltime to work on video games. What's more, I don't feel particularly driven to do sound design in my free time, because I have nothing to design sound for. That's made me doubt if I have any place in the industry at all.

At any rate, I need a job very soon, and I no longer feel like LA is a good place to be for getting into video games. Today, I was looking at an application for Trader Joe's and, being disgusted with myself, tossed it aside. I feel like all my time since college has been a waste. I don't know what to do, other than continue creating random pieces of work and hoping that someone likes what I've done. I've been heavily considering applying for jobs at small, indie studios in San Francisco and Boston, but I am thoroughly dissatisfied with my work portfolio, and don't want to apply anywhere until I'm sure I can impress someone with something I've done (don't even have the money to move anyway).

I just want to work in the video game industry, and hopefully make enough to pay rent. I want to get involved in the community, assist in the design process, write character backstories, schedule progress milestones, maybe even provide music - I want to contribute in some way to something I'm passionate about in an industry with people I identify with. It doesn't have to be in audio, but audio is what I'm best at. Am I being naive? What on earth could I do competently enough so that my work is considered helpful, necessary, and excellent? I'm a member of the LA IGDA chapter, I've been on GANG and Gamasutra constantly, I've submitted so many applications to video game companies, I've networked my ass off, I've done sound design and music for video games, and I'm still at square one, because my work is mediocre and my effort seems wasted. If someone told me to do three different pieces of background music, twenty sound effects, and an essay to be considered for a job at a video game company, I would be happy to. But I've never felt so unwanted in an industry before - it seems like nobody will even give me a chance. I am now confused and desperate, and don't know where to focus my effort."
168a05,12,2013-01-08,"So much stress, but still losing it",kiwias,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/168a05/so_much_stress_but_still_losing_it/,"Background: 5'4"" 21 year old female. My starting weight as of May 1st 2012 was 168. I was disgusted. Lost 9 pounds the first week then followed with another 10 before classes ended mid June. I plateaued all summer but finally joined 24 hour fitness in early October when classes started back up. I went off and on then started losing focus. 

The weekend before Halloween I went out to a party with some of my guy friends I've known since freshmen year at college (seniors now). After the party I was driving everyone home. The last stop was an apartment two of them shared and I lived 20 minutes away. Despite not drinking I was extremely tired and they invited me to crash on their couch. Long story short in the middle of the night one of them attempted to rape me. After that it was scary to go to the gym as they went to the same one as me. After a couple days I realized I needed a new motivation. I signed up for a personal trainer. It was the best decision I've made.

Fast forward to now and I've been counting calories (1200 a day), exercising every day, and I just finished my 18th training session. I've still been under a considerable amount of stress but I have lost another 11 pounds since I started training on Halloween and despite battling major foot problems for a few years I'm training for a half marathon at the end of this month.

The stress has been coming from so many places. I have two jobs, I'm struggling to pay rent, I'm graduating school and trying to find an internship and job (and I want to move when I graduate so I'm looking for jobs outside my state which is harder than I anticipated), and of course I'm still dealing with the ramifications of what my ""friend"" tried to do. At this point I haven't seen any of those boys and only talk to one.

It's been a hard road but it just got harder. Despite everything I never once went over my calorie count or missed a workout (except two extreme sick days). But tonight I snapped. I drank a beer, which isn't smart because I also suffer from chronic migraines and for some reason even one alcoholic drink is a trigger, and had a double double with animal fries and dr pepper from in n out. Just for dinner.

I did this because 24 hours ago I was informed by my dr that the benign mole she removed two weeks ago is actually pre cancer. I have to get more of it removed and it has to be monitored for the rest of my life. If I hadn't asked her to remove it (I just thought it was ugly) it would have been melanoma within a year. 

But guys, tonight might have been an overreating day but tomorrow I WILL be back at it. I told my trainer what happened and asked him to completely kick my ass tonight since I wasn't planning to count calories. He agreed I needed this night but still looked like a kid in a candy store when I said he could do his worst. Which he did.... I don't think I'll be able to lift my arms tomorrow.

Don't worry about one night. Distressing via food is okay if it's not every week. Sometimes you need it, I know I did. Thank you for letting me share my story. 

18 pounds til my goal weight. I can freaking do it.

TL;DR: Attempted rape by a trusted ""friend"", ankle problems, chronic migraines, and now pre cancer. But I'm still losing it."

My grades were pretty low (well above 2.3, just below 2.7, if that makes any sense) and I was hoping to land an internship somewhere with a small firm like GT.

So now I am extremely disappointed that I cannot even apply for internships. I spent the year working 2 part time jobs and was part of 2 business related clubs at school hoping to build a great resume for jobs.

So where do I go from here? Though I technically won't be out of the internship program, there is a internship-only networking session coming up with the likes of KPMG and GT among other big (but not accounting) companies there.

I think I am going to go but once I build a network with these reps, should I tell them my situation afterwards and explain why they may not have seen my application? 

Where do I go from here? I'm so scared that I'm about a year away from graduation with no relatable work experience and I definitely could've networked a lot more during my undergrad. I'm hoping to land a job with a small CA firm but what about a CGA or CMA designation? I am still very much at a loss and what specifically I want to go into but accounting is definitely most familiar to me and salary is attractive (though I like marketing as well).

I'm at a weird place in my career and I could use some help.

I work in animal care, and I'm hoping to get into zoo education or zookeeping. I've had internships in both, and I loved them.

I moved to a tiny zoo-less town with my boyfriend for his grad program, where the only animal care job I could get was working with lab animals. I hate it, but I've managed to climb up the chain a bit and make okay money (for animal care).

Now, he's left his program and we're free to escape the tiny town! However, that means finding a new job, and getting a zoo job is incredibly difficult. I will almost certainly need to take something else while I chip away at that. Would it be better (or at least less harmful) for my resume to:

-Keep going in lab animal care, at the risk of pigeonholing myself into this field the more I advance (but which is more hands-on), or

-Take any old retail job while I volunteer in the positions I hope to get paid for later

In an ideal situation, that ""any old retail job"" would be at a pet store or zoo gift shop, or working in a kennel, but I can't count on grabbing one of those right away.

Which way should I be aiming?"

My boss is the CFO, and I was hired on to do a cost analysis of the bank's products (different deposit and loan products). After 8 months, I've finally finished that project, and I'm moving on to smaller things while things wind down.

My boss assigned me the task of going over the investment committee's policies to ensure that they comply with OCC regulations. He advised me to use the OCC examiner handbook and to comb through our policies and their relative handbooks. This is proving to be a much more daunting task than I thought it'd be.

The handbooks are all around 80 pages long and our policies are probably 10-15 pages long each. I've highlighted important information in the various PDFs and taken some hand written notes, but when it comes time to compare policies to regulations I feel like I am getting nowhere.

I know nothing about investment securities and the various terminology that goes along with it. My boss is a very busy man, and I have been told many times in the past that he is very happy with me because I do not require much coaching or handholding due to my ability to get the job done using outside resources (mainly AccountingCoach.com lol). So anyway, I'd like to get some real work done on this project without resorting to asking my boss to guide me. I have no real support system at work because the only other person in the department is his secretary, and she doesn't deal with anything like this. 

It doesn't help that I haven't had an audit course yet. I feel like I might even be approaching this all wrong because I don't know what goes into it yet. Does anyone have any advice for me?

I'm always excited to find new music so if you have a great group you'd like to share I'd love to take a listen.

I'm also a songwriter who works on stuff from time to time.  Have roughly an album-worth but haven't gotten around to laying any of it down.  I might be inclined to sharing little demos if you're curious.  :P


**You're a redditor...don't hide the nerd**

[Okay](http://retrorpg.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/13301_portal_now_youre_thinking_with_portals.jpg), [I](http://hardrockheavymetal.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/guitar-hero-3.jpg).

I don't bombard people with constant Portal quotes or talk endlessly about reddit or anything.  I'm more a math/physics kind of nerd, who likes to build his own toys and blow stuff up.  Also, I know how to have a conversation without looking at my feet.  :D

**""The bad stuff""**

* Alcohol: I consume it socially, don't really drink otherwise.  Don't care if you do or not. 

* Do you smoke?  ""Smoke what?"" 

* * Cigarettes/cigars/[cigarillos](http://straightfromthedome.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/swisher-sweet-cigarillo-wine1.jpg): only when I'm drunk.  I really can't stand them otherwise and I'm allergic to them in a very mild way.   

* * [Hookah](http://i.imgur.com/VSx7m.jpg): Yes, at least a few times a week.  Even have a lounge I frequent often with friends.  The owner is a great guy.

* * [Trees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees): ...you've got a frient in me. :D

If you don't partake in one of the above that I do partake in, don't worry; I'm not here to shove my hobbies down your throat.  Live and let live. (:

**The stuff that gives me money**

I'm an engineering student who is currently taking a break from school to save money.  I do plan on going back and I'm still enrolled in university, just not enrolled in classes.  I work as an intern at a civil engineering firm and I also work for a tutoring club (K-12), where I work with grade school kids of all ages in math, science, reading and writing.  

**Things you should know**

Once you get to know me I'm quite normal, but at first I'm shy until I figure out your personality.  So once you've got me out of my shell I will probably spend most moments trying to make you laugh, and I'm fairly successful most of the time.  

Also, on occasion, I will ""play"" socially awkward, basically mimic the personality for laughs.  I'm sort of weird (random, actually), but more in the funny ""Haha you werido (:"" kind of way and not really in the ""...*fucking weirdo*"" kind of way.

Pretty much I like to make everything I possibly can fun or interesting so you'll never really get a dull moment with me, if we share similar interests.  If nothing about the above sounds interesting or similar to you we might not get on so well.  Just a heads up.  

^^^It's ^^^been ^^^a ^^^while ^^^since ^^^*coughyeahcough* ^^^so ^^^if ^^^things ^^^go ^^^like ^^^[this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwm7crkV124&amp;feature=youtu.be) ^^^that's ^^^definitely ^^^a ^^^possibility.

16c9og,4,2013-01-10,CS Career Paths,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16c9og/cs_career_paths/,"Hi reddit,

I'm currently a junior CS student at the University of Idaho, and working as a software engineering intern for Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. My manager has asked for a write up and what direction I want to start pursuing for my career. The problem is, I have no idea. I have experience in several languages, and love designing software (not just programming). I've talked with my academic advisor, but he unfortunately could only tell me that it's too early to go down any one path, and I personally also feel I have too little industry experience to even know what all the available paths are.

Currently I think there are a few things I don't want to do: I'm not the biggest of fan of worrying about low level programming (I prefer high level abstractions, and I love studying different programming paradigms), so I don't think I want to to systems engineering or anything embedded.

My interest is currently piqued by release engineering. I am a major fan of source control, especially huge scale systems like GitHub. Continuous Integration I also think is a super neat concept.

I'm currently possibly being tasked with Jenkins plugin development, which would give me a lot of experience with Java and build systems.

I'm excited, but apprehensive, as RE seems like it can be very dirty, possibly unappreciated work, where if something breaks it falls on you to fix it ASAP (which is something I really didn't like as a system administrator with a small company I used to work for). I like my days 9-5 without a whole lot of work pressure during my off hours. Also, RE seems like a pretty set path that's difficult to hop out off.

I'm looking for advice, what would you do in my situation, and where would you look to learn more about what all I could go into?

Thanks reddit!"

Volunteer opportunities dealing with kids and/or abuse victims?! ,zombikki,StLouis,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/16c3gi/help_volunteer_opportunities_dealing_with_kids/,"Hi there! I'm currently attending SLU and getting my psych degree. This semester I've got a class that's a practicum and requires 90 hours of volunteer service at a place dealing with humanities of sorts--anything, really. I have several ideas and suggestions I've gotten from other people, but I'm looking for more specifics. I actually live in O'Fallon, Illinois, so I'm looking for suggestions all over the area. I know it's ridiculously late to be looking and asking for suggestions, but all of the ones that I know of and can think of that AREN'T full on volunteers... don't have much to do with my specific field of psychology! 

To give you an idea of what I'm looking for:

I plan on specializing in trauma, specifically sexual violence trauma and/or domestic abuse. I also want to work with children. I eventually want to get my PhD to hopefully become a child therapist, and again, specialize in trauma. Now what I'm looking for is something that does have children. I've already contacted ALIVE and sadly they're full on interns and volunteers for this semester. That was one of my big bets, so I'm pretty bummed. 

If you know of any charities or organizations that specialize with battered women and children, abuse of any kind, trauma centers, or things with underprivileged teens and children, please, let me know! I'd absolutely love to volunteer there and spend my time. I love working with children and I think I'd enjoy working with underprivileged kids the most, actually! 

Anything in the St. Louis area or on the other side of the river in Illinois works. I've got a few nursing homes I can do it at but I want to do something more relevant to my eventual professional goal!

Thanks! Really sorry if this shouldn't go here. :( 

If you need more information on me because you perhaps already volunteer/work for an organization that could use me, please feel free to message me! "

Background -- I've worked as an intern in a startup doing web development and statistical analysis; and as lackey in a genetics lab. I am/was in the last year of a program leading to a BS in math, with a broad academic range of electives, but I'm not sure I can find an outlet for those skills in my home country without a degree.

I'm a graduate student studying extensively for board exams in my profession and have a very hard time keeping up with the studying. I procrastinate a bunch and can't focus on ONE thing for more than 10 - 15 minutes, even movies or tv shows can't keep my attention sometimes. I blame internet browsing and growing up with such a piecemeal digestion of information. I've done above average in school without any ADD meds, but in college I would leave things for last minute and do my work medicated under Adderall XR (20mg) that my friend was prescribed. It worked wonders, but I didn't think I needed it on a daily basis, since it was pretty intense.

Fast forward to now, I've had internships in professional settings and couldn't focus on ""paperwork"" or anything technical unless I drank about 20 - 32oz. of coffee throughout the day. I also have recently been prescribed a low dose of Zoloft and Klonopin (as needed). The day after klonopin, I have even a harder time and definitely need caffeine to get cracking. I get headaches and my tolerance has been high, so I am starting to dislike relying on coffee. I think I need something different.

I've been falling behind and almost unable to study for my current workload. Only to be adding on another part-time obligation this coming semester with my studying and PT grad school. I'd like to be able to focus and SLEEP at night so I can get things done without anxiety. I get anxiety and miss sleeping due to my worrying about not accomplishing things during the day.

My younger brother was prescribed Vyvanse and I have been taking a 50mg every few days or so, and that's when I feel normal and can accomplish things/read and socialize without any anxiety. 

I have a Dr. Appointment coming up to refill on my meds and check-up with bloodwork. I am thinking of asking my general physician about my ADD/ADHD and what I can do to find help with my situation right now. I think a prescription would really help me out as my workload increases as I start my career. 

Background: healthy, 22-year-old, I go to the gym 3-4 a week, drink green smoothies, eat veggies and fruit, and don't drink more than 1x a week at most.

*edit: from patrick's blog

""There used to be a time when, as advertisers, we only had to worry about amplifying our message beyond competing brands. Now, not only do we have to beat out the competition, but we also have to break through the clutter of consumer content. Information and ideas are everywhere;  a customer opinion has never mattered more than it does today. We can’t just shout from the rooftops anymore, spray and pray no longer works. We have to engage. Advertising is about community and conversation. A community is organic, it grows and shifts with time, it’s adaptable to our needs and if a crisis happens a community works together to rebuild and fix. At GRIP this is even apparent in how we work as an agency: always growing, listening and interacting in open dialogue to come up with the best ideas for our clients. We have to look to the future and understand where all of this will go, but I’m also deeply focused on right now… What is happening? What are people saying and why? It’s our job to find out. I’ll be looking at all things digital, social and engaging in order to better understand this untethered world of information we are all trying to communicate in.
Patrick XXX started as an intern Social Media Planner for a small Toronto agency before briefly working at Apple. He now holds a Social Content Strategist position at GRIP.""

[What happened between you and Jenna? I understand she left to run the YouTube videos, which was always her goal, but why does the animosity/bad blood exist between you, as shown by some of your blogs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u2vzo?context=5)|This one would take forever to reply.  Should have written it first because I obviously knew it was coming.  Truth is Jenna and I didn't have problems for 99% of the time she was here.  When I hired her she cried she was so happy. She was working in a tanning salon.  I told her I wanted to make her into a personality.  Hence ""Getting Weird with Jenna"" videos and shit.  Turned out she could write too.  Gave her Stoolala.   She'd do anything we ever asked.  The second and I mean the second her first video hit she got weird.  She'd come into my office once a week and say I was exploiting her because I wanted to make money off her.  I told her that's why I hired her.  She'd refuse to meet with advertisers who wanted to advertise.  She tried to charge me 10K to appear in Quirk ad when I was paying her 50K a year as an employee.  Still we got along because I thought she was just nuts.   She hated blogging which she openly admits.  She basically stopped working for me.  Money was tight and I told her that as long as I could keep the lights on she'd have a job with us but if things got too tight she'd be the first to get the axe.   I suggested she sell tshirts with her face on them and I'd front the money and she could keep all the profits beyond her salary.   Long story short is once she thought she may be done at Barstool she went beserk making videos and doing all the things I'd always asked her to do.  Despite all that I still would have left on good terms if it weren't for the last blog she wrote saying her succcess had nothing to do with Barstool and spitting in my face basically.  This was despite us having a 2 hour heart to heart the day before.  She talked about how she was getting fired and didn't know when Stoolala would be shut down.  I offered to give her the site no strings attached.  Just give it to her.  Bottomline is I thought she painted me out to be a douchebag when all I did was help her.   Now when people ask her how she got her start she says she was just making videos in a tanning salon.  It's infuriating.   It has nothing to do with money.  She emailed me six months ago and apologized and I pretty much told her to go fuck herself.
[You joke about being worth ""internet dollars"" but in all seriousness has barstool had any offers to be bought by a larger company?

Always content comes up.  Will we tone down what we do.  I always say we won't.   I'd rather figure out how to make money ourselves than change our tone.   We are one of the last blogs of our size that has stayed true to what we do.   I think that scares a ton of advertisors, investors aways.  It's also why Stoolies like us I think.

[Why do you think Barstool and similar sites get a lot of hate from feminist groups for promoting rape culture, sexism, etc., but when someone like Chelsea Handler can make jokes about men from the other side,  it's somehow okay because she's a woman? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u2y13?context=5)|Yes.

Writers 60ish.
[What do you think of “rape culture”, a term that seems to have originated specifically from critics of Barstool? I imagine you wouldn’t deny charges of your website being misogynistic in tone, but do you feel the accusation that your website actually subconsciously or explicitly condones rape to be fair on any level? When you hear that specific term, what is your reaction? Does it piss you off? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u34wt?context=5)|I don't think it is fair on any level whatsoever.   ZERO.

With all the shit you spew on Barstool regarding how you'd love to bang other smokes or how many women you'd take down if you were single (which in 99% of the cases, wouldn't happen;  but that's neither here nor there\), is your wife able to always distinguish and separate the blog from real life? I can imagine there are a lot of ""David we're married now..please tone it down with your obsession of Sophie Turner and her huge dump-shoot"" moments. Does your stuff ever lead to blow-ups at home?

It was a special moment in time that will never be replicated.  Everybody who was at Hobart and the parties the night before know what I mean.

I can't look for a job. I'm too depressed to, and I don't know what to look for or where. My interest is in working with bears, it's been the focus of most of the internships I've taken, I've gone on an internship each summer, at zoos and wildlife sanctuaries and on field studies, but that's all I've been able to do, just summer internships, not permanent jobs, and as soon as they're over I'm back at home with my parent in a house and environment that crushes me with depression and hopelessness, and robs me of all motivation to do anything. I've had some neat experiences on my internships, working with bears and lots of other animals, but as soon as I get back home they become distant memories, like worlds away, and I feel the gloom of our house close in on me, like I've never been anywhere or done anything and never will. My dad died 3 years ago and it's just my mom and brother on and off, and the house feels almost haunted by its memories and quiet. My goal when I return home is to always look for a job asap and move out, to improve my habits and get involved in lots of activities, but I always fail at all of those endeavors and sink into a slump of doing hardly anything at all at home. I've had a job listing website open on my browser for weeks, hoping I'll eventually look for one, but i physically can't bring myself to go past their front page, I'm so addicted to the internet, to facebook and reddit browsing and to MLP:FIM and other dumb distractions that I can't even get the first item of my shit together and get through a few simple clicks of job searching. I don't know what to do next. I don't know where to go from here. I can't stand my environment anymore and I want to move onto something else but I'm so crushed with depression and guilt and self loathing from it that I can't motivate myself to do anything to try and get out of this situation. I need to move out of the house and find my own place and live around other people i can regularly socialize with but I can't fucking get out of this house, I can't move, I just don't know what to do. 

Each day goes by I swear to myself I'll do something today... I sit on the internet all day and when the sun goes down the guilt hits me hard, I stay up all night hating myself swearing I won't go to bed until I get something done, and I don't, my body resists everything I try and tell it to do, I just stubbornly browse facebook/reddit/ponies until 4:00 am and finally give into exhaustion and crawl into bed hating myself, and sleep until noon the next day and immediately get back on the computer again when I get up back for more. Months go by like this with me hardly noticing. I don't know where the fuck time goes. The internet and all of its crap is the only thing that keeps me from thinking about how much I hate myself for being such a lazy incompetent bum. When i'm off of it I freak out and panic about these things. I want to smash my computer, but it's the very thing I need if I want to find a job and get out of here, it's what I need to escape and to find a job and it's what's keeping me down. I don't know what to do. This cycle has been going on for too long, and it's about time i put an end to it, by whatever means. I don't care if I have to move out onto the streets and live as a beggar, I just want something to change and I want to be self-reliant."

I've taken a few courses here and there, but it's still not enough and I'm struggling to make my next move. 

First option is pursue a second Bachelors Degree in Design at an acclaimed art school, studying illustration with a graphic design minor. Would take me a minimum of 3 years even with my current BA. Second option is take continuing education courses in graphic design/illustration part-time to earn a Graphic Design certificate at a local college (I'd aim to finish this in a year). This would allow me to continue looking for internships/work.

I'm 24 now and feel really unsure of what to do next...Any advice?"

I've got a bachelor's degree under my belt already, and I'm doing a 2 year addition at my alma mater to get a second degree in CS. 

From what I've hear from friends and relatives and found online, its really difficult to immigrate to California. Has anyone here done this who was originally from Canada?

What are my chances of landing an internship at a big company like Google, Amazon, or Msft down in the states before I graduate? I've got near a 4.0, and hopefully will have some local co-op experience before I get into my upper division classes. 

My goal for the future is to move to California. Even if the money wasn't better there, I would still want to go. I don't mind Vancouver, but I've been to Cali and I fell in love with the weather and the cities there. Washington would be okay too.

I'm hoping to hear some success stories, but I wouldn't mind knowing about some of the pitfalls as well."

I only have 2 law classes left to take (1 this quarter, 1 next) and am ready to graduate from law school. For my M.A I only have 9 credits left to take which I will accomplish by the end of Spring term. 

My M.A program required that I do research or an internship, which I did and than do a final ""M.A project"". The project has to be a policy paper, a thesis or a paper that is accepted at a approved journal. 
I chose to write a paper based on the research I did in my international internship and have been ready to submit it to a journal for over 6 months now. My adviser has done basically everything in his power to block it from being published. 

He has had me re-write the same parts of the paper over and over again. At one point I was in a 4 hour long meeting with him every week for almost 2 months about plagiarism and how bad it is. I finally had to take to the head of my department who stepped in, read my paper and told the professor nothing in it was plagiarized and that my paper was ready for submission. 

That was 4 months ago and we are still stuck in the same spot. Right before Christmas, I finally asked my adviser if there was reason he didn't want me to get published and graduate and he just ignored the question. I've done everything this man has asked of me and I'm tired of worrying about this. If I have any hope of getting this paper approved for publication in time, I need to submit it by the end of this month at the very latest. 

I don't know what to do or who to talk to anymore. The head of the department is aware of the situation and hasn't done anything more than to tell my adviser that its ready for publication. 

**REVISION** 

I spoke to another professor who said that I should ask to have my adviser switched and he volunteered to be my adviser. I don't know if I should that this late in the process or if its even a option. 

**REVISION II**

I had a meeting with the head of the department and the Dean on Friday and we finally got everything sorted out. I don't know exactly what happened but the head of the department contacted me today to say that my adviser that been changed to a professor I'd spoken to before and that I was being allowed to graduate before the paper was approved for publication. I have 3 months after graduation to get it approved for publication in a approved journal which should be plenty of time since my new adviser is being amazing. He took my paper yesterday and said that he would give me all his thoughts and suggested edits by Friday so I can submit it soon. 

Thank you everyone for all your help!"

I'm studying computer science at college and I'm going to start applying for internships for this summer soon - specifically, it's always been a dream of mine to work at Blizzard and I plan to seriously apply there. I read all over the place (and have heard from employers first-hand) that it is a HUGE plus to have code that they can look at, presumably in the form of an open source project or contributions to an open source project. In my case, I'm nearing completion of an XNA platformer in C#, and could hypothetically make my github project public so that they could view the code. However, my game isn't architecturally very profound (because I've been focusing more on the design side of the game) and I'm worried that they would look at it and scoff at its lack of professional game-development techniques, or have a hard time understanding it's layout or why I made the decisions I did.

So my question is this: what exactly are companies looking for in ""sample code""? What are the risks of showing a company your code? Are they really looking for smart engineering decisions, or is it more of just a screening?

On the one hand, I want to show off the fact that I can make a game and know to code, but the other hand I'm scared to show off any inadequencies that I may have. If anyone could give me some advice on how to approach this, whether from personal experience or what they've read, it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

16at0g,6,2013-01-10,How can I bow out of being in my friend's wedding party without ruining our friendship?,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/16at0g/how_can_i_bow_out_of_being_in_my_friends_wedding/,"Last summer one of my closest, long-time friends asked me to be a bridesmaid. I didn't immediately accept, and explained to her that I was honored but that I did not think that it would be financially possible for me because I am currently in graduate school across the country and my budget doesn't allow for more than the bare minimum of living expenses. She said that she would speak with her dad and that as he was very wealthy and had lots of frequent flier miles my $400 airplane ticket would be covered one way or another. So I agreed. 

I checked in with her to see how the conversation with her dad went, and she said that she hadn't found the right time to talk to him about it and that she would later.  A few weeks later she casually mentioned in an email that her father lost his job and is now unable to help pay for her wedding. She did not mention anything about the airplane ticket, but she still continues to send emails about the wedding planning.

I am still unable to afford a ticket and rental car expenses, and she and her fiance would be unable to pay for the ticket as well since they had to postpone the wedding because he was filing bankruptcy (plus I would feel horrible having them pay for it). I think that she is hoping that I will suck it up and just pay for it (she has done this in the past), but part of my even agreeing to be in the wedding was on the understanding that airfare wouldn't be an issue.

I also just found out that my dream summer internship that I am applying for would require me to relocate the weekend of her wedding, so if I was accepted for the internship I would not be able to be in the wedding anyway because this opportunity is instrumental in my career. 

So far no dresses have been ordered, the wedding isn't until May, and quite honestly there is a chance that it could be called off as she has been unhappy with her fiance. What is the most tactful way that I can step out of the wedding party without ruining our friendship? I know that my presence there would mean a great deal to her, and I care about her and want to support her, but with the unexpected expense of paying for airfare and the internship dates conflicting with the wedding, I am just unable to. I can't help but feel selfish."

16ane2,2,2013-01-09,I'm Lost. Looking to put myself back together. ,alien_abduction,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/16ane2/im_lost_looking_to_put_myself_back_together/,"So, I joined nofap this summer, biggest streak was 28 days. Those were some good times. Instead of going on some crazy sexscapades I ended a several year relationship because we had grown apart. Nofap gave me the power to do it. Jumped into another relationship really quick. No sex thankfully, because I realize now that it would have just made it worse. Realized that nofap also gave the the confidence to ask her out. Started fapping again. Didn't feel like I really needed nofap but always wanted to come back. 

We ended up breaking up. Thankfully. She had her own issues and I'm just delving into mine. It ended really bad for just about a six week thing. I realized something. 

I can't be alone, ever. I have a problem with myself. I've been in therapy for about eight months for the passing of a close friend and I thought I was doing great. I'm a double major at a great University. Landed a sweet internship. On the outside I'm doing great. Inside, I can't stand myself. I hate being alone. I have no girl prospects and that bothers me. I feel like if I had stuck with nofap I would be better but at least I can focus on this issue. I'm getting back into my meditation which I have practiced casually since this fall. 

I've been a mess the last couple of weeks. I had to stop smoking trees now, since I've been using it and alcohol to cope. I'm not giving them up, just need to use those for fun. If I can't be happy with myself then I don't need to use things like fapping, trees and alcohol to escape. I need to exercise again. I'm not fat, but I've been binging on fast food to fill whatever hole I have. I used to never feel like this.

I need to learn to love myself. Be ok with being alone. I just have this weird thing in my head that I HAVE TO BE WITH SOMEONE. I need to find out why I think this. I need to quit the porn and the fapping. I need to not try to escape reality just because I'm upset my me. I thought I was past this. A month ago, I had everything. Now I feel like I have nothing. I need to invest in more time with just friends. Still, I feel like there's something wrong with me if I'm not dating someone. I don't know why. I need to be me for awhile. I need help, I need advice, I need accountability people checking in on me or something. I can't keep resetting my badge every morning and telling myself this is the last time for real. Because I keep lying to myself. I hate myself right now. I want to love me again. 

**
tl:dr: I'm lost, I feel lonely, and after a long time of failing at nofap, I see the problems go much deeper for me than anything I could have imagined. **"

My Company matches up to 6% of my contributions something I take full advantage of, however, as a part time employee, 6% of nothing is still relatively nothing, so it's slow going. I was thinking about switching over my 401K to a Roth IRA where (I think) it will grow more quickly but am not sure if this is proper logic or if it's even possible. My current school debt is $6467 and am estimating it to be around ~$15k (all loans are subsidized) when I graduate. I make roughly $1k a month after taxes, insurance, union dues, etc from my part time job and occasionally intern during breaks in between school to earn some extra cash. I have no credit card debt (pay it off monthly) and no car payment. I feel like I need to be doing more financially but am at a complete loss.

Also, I was employed by Circuit City for 2 years before they went under and contributed to a 401K there as well, however, never followed through when claiming stuff while they were filing for bankruptcy (big mistake). The 401K provider, Wachovia, was purchased by Wells Fargo. When I created an account with Wells Fargo, it recognized I had a Circuit City 401K plan with a balance of $0. Is there any way to recover my own money I put in to the 401K?  

I apologize if it's difficult to follow. I would like to become a better investor while in school. I've only recently followed this forum, however, it's been incredibly helpful and I've already taken advice given in other threads.

Thanks in advance!"

The only reason that I have not quit yet is because I'm holding out on the chance that they *might* hire me, eventually.

During his first week of work, his new boss came up and told him that they wanted to pretend he is and/or classify him as an ""intern"" so that he can file taxes on his 1099 as an independent contractor, instead of filling out a W2. They said they were doing this for his benefit, so that he could write off his transportation costs on his taxes.

None of this sounds too kosher to me though. It seems pretty clear to me that they want to do things this way so that they don't have to contribute social security or pay unemployment if they fire him, etc.

Two(ish) questions:

1. Is there anything legally suspect about what the company is doing? Is it fraud to hire somebody as an employee and then turn around and classify them as an intern? And fraud against *whom*? My friend, or the government, or both?

2. My friend is frankly just happy to be getting paid, and doesn't care much what goes on with the paperwork. He doesn't want to make a fuss here. But if the company ever got audited, could my friend be liable in all this? Is he complicit for playing along, assuming something rotten is going on?

I have worked on large projects for class, but I haven't really done any projects on my own outside of class. How much will this impact me?

Also, I'm pretty apprehensive about technical interviews in general. I do well in school, but a large part of that is because of my study habits and whatnot. As previously mentioned, I don't do a ton of work outside of class so I need to refresh myself on some things. So really any advice for preparing for technical interviews is appreciated.

Finally, I have a question regarding my interests in CS. I'm really interested in both linguistics and artificial intelligence. I've enjoyed most of my other classes, but these were the ones that I was really passionate about. I may be wrong, but it seems like it would be more difficult to find a job in those fields. Also, would I need a graduate degree in order to really work in those areas?

Is there a bad stigma against manga/comics in the literary world? Would anyone care about my working in a manga house prior or would they dismiss my experience there as unnecessary?

Now the manga house I'm at is fairly popular and successful, and I'm pretty sure the work and experience will be legit. But I still wanted some second opinions and insight on the field.

*3rd year Comparative literature major minoring in Global studies.
*Interning at a fashion magazine at the moment, but it's unpaid and I feel like it's a waste of time as I'm not learning much.
*I go to a pretty respectable school, within top 25 of most US rankings.
*I don't have much work experience though, which I'm trying to work on now.
*I don't know HTML and/or CSS. Not good with Photoshop either

As for the last bullet point, I've seen that on several internship requirements/desired qualities. How heavily does it factor in my application? And what exactly do they want me to do with Photoshop and html? Is it enough just to be able to read HTML and fix minor mistakes?

After graduating, I spent some of 2012 (Jan-April) looking for jobs in Germany and finally found something with a different division of my company. We have been living here since August and love it! Feel free to ask whatever, I've gone through the apartment hunt/visa/German paperwork process several times now and should be able to help out if somebody is in a similar situation! "

But living in another country for a while is kinda nerve racking. Basically a few things I was hoping to find out; 
1) How are Americans viewed?
2) Do people really hate our accents?
3) Any major cultural differences?
4) What are some things I should check out while I'm there.?
Any other advice would be great to hear what you guys have to say."

16dznk,7,2013-01-11,Facing hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans - do I get out now?,thehyruler,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16dznk/facing_hundreds_of_thousands_of_dollars_in/,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I apologize in advance if this seems like a redundant post topic and for the great length of the post, but I have not seen any posts with debt as high as what I am looking at. I am way in over my head, financially. I am attending American University in Washington, D.C as a first year student, although this is my first semester. I have 35 credits so far which is helping speed up the process of graduating, but I am still looking at 4-5 years of school in order to graduate with my undergrad/master's through an accelerated master's program. I am majoring in International Affairs if that matters. 

I spoke with the Financial Aid office yesterday and here are my numbers for **one** semester:

Room/board - $4,663

Tuition - $19,491

Other fees - $258.50

-$5,445 in subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans

Total Cost - $20,682.50

I received no aid from my FASFA other than the loans. My parents make ~$109,000 annually and they have around $35,000 saved up for me (I know, they are extremely generous and I am very lucky to have this). However, I am still looking at around $41,241 every year. Assuming I attend for five years, that is ~$192,000 in debt. I am sure they will help with what they can, but I would hate to be a burden. That number does not take into account any scholarships I may win (trust me, I am applying) but I feel like all of the scholarships I get will be a drop in the bucket. I am also applying to a couple jobs on campus that pay $9/hour which is decent, I think.

The reason I chose AU was because of their great internship program and career placement. I feel conservatively confident that I can get a decent job coming out of the school but I don't know if it is worth that much debt. Should I transfer? Stay here? Any advice on where I should get my loans?

I apologize again for the length of this post and sporadic points but I almost feel like I made the wrong decision coming to AU no matter how good of a school it is. I really appreciate any help/advice anybody has to offer. Thank you so much in advance. "

I've had a few internships since getting out of high school. The most recent was developing some test scripts for a large internal application (using QTP). I have also worked with a company, before leaving them after about a month, partially because my coursework was pretty heavy going into the fall semester. They were building a web application using ExtJS and Java. I had done all the necessary training and was starting to work on an actual feature, but of course decided to quit. Before that, I had a work-study where I created educational 3d worlds/helped manage servers and labs, classrooms. The first internship was basically scanning/importing maps and drawing the walls for a Cisco WCS, along with helping image systems, and moving machines around.

My programming classes have been in Java, and I feel reasonably comfortable reading javadoc, and java in general. Did a simple android app last semester, and studied android security for that upper level security class. I have also done some linux kernel programming in C, and while I understood that class well, I had a partner to get help with the actual programming.

At home, I have an ESXi server as well as a pfsense firewall. Mainly have a file server and a minecraft server running off of it.


I'm not sure what direction I should take. I feel like I don't have enough programming experience, and my grade in the upper level security class wasn't great either. I am planning to learn Python this j-term. When reading around reddit, the usual response it to find an open source project and contribute to it. I would indeed like to do that, but never know where to start. 

Finally, I'm not sure if I should go to Grad School. What should I be asking myself about this?

Thanks!"

Hello ladies and gentleme-en. I figured after getting a few messages, I'd go ahead and update to let people know that I AM continuing forward with the GVT program. I figured after having completed the first cycle myself, I can point out a few things I've noticed to help others who have been asking the same questions a couple of times now:

1. I am doing an unedited version of the program, which can be found [here.](http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/441/German_Volume_Training.aspx) **DON'T FUCK WITH IT**. It is enough work in itself.

2. EAT BIG + SLEEP BIG = GET BIG. I actually had one member inform me they were tired all the time, weren't really seeing results, feeling depressed, etc. If you're doing this program, you MUST eat a LOT and get more than enough sleep. I'm currently at 4,000 calories and sleep between 8 and 9 hours a night, and I STILL hurt in the mornings.

3. Yes, I'm keeping track of everything. Food, sleep, performance, bodily measurements, water drank, supplements taken, etc.

4. Leg day will wreck your soul.

As far as DOMS goes, you will feel if it. Chest day and arm day hurt about equally, but you're going to know a new kind of hell if you have a job requiring you to stand for hours (mine) and have to do it the day of, after, or after after leg day.

That's about all I can think of to address the question that have turned up. I can't be on here as long as I'd like due to currently doing 2 internships, my job, classes, and sleeping early. Ain't nobody got time for nothing with this bullshit. I should be done with this by the first weekend of March.

~~I need to know if someone knows for SURE if this is a five day cycle program, or just five days out of the week program. I have one site that says one way, and another site that suggests otherwise.~~

~~[Coldhardt's link](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/luis13.htm) suggests doing one cycle for 6 weeks.~~

~~[My link](http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/441/German_Volume_Training.aspx) suggests just doing and completing a cycle the immediately go into the next one, stating you only need those five days to recover anyway.~~

Disregard, found several more sources. Depends on the program. The unchanged ""original"" one is cycle based, not weekly."

During my stay here, I'll go to about £6500, not more. I'm not likely to return to Britain for work afterwards either.

Does this mean I can just continue doing personal invoicing? Do I owe HM anything?

Ok to start off let me give some background info: I am a 19 year old, male who just finished my first semester at the UofM. I am a aerial performer working with a local aerial company by the name of Valeria's Wings(http://www.valeriaswings.com/) I make a small amount of money doing shows but when I say small I mean maybe once a month I make enough to fill my gas tank(and I drive a small car). 

However though I am honestly losing money doing aerial it is my passion. There really isn't a better feeling then flying and performing in front people. It's the only thing that has ever inspired me in my short little life and I couldn't be happier doing anything else!

Now here is where I ask for the advice.

I mentioned earlier that I had just finished my first semester of college. And well yes I will admit I enjoyed it and had a lot of fun and learned a lot of things...I don't think it's for me. ACTUALLY no it's just not for me right NOW! I do want a degree one day(hoping to get one in Hospitality) right now it just isn't what I'm passionate about. 

Money for college isn't even a issue either I am lucky to have VA benefits from my parents and that money will still be there when I come back.

What I do love however is my performing in aerial. The problem however is right now I'm not making really any money from it. HOWEVER I can be very soon. I am working on a internship program with a bigger traveling company that I've already worked with before. The issue is money till then. Membership at the studio I practice at is $130 a month. I've been applying everywhere but so far no luck.

So here is where y'all come in. I need help deciding:

A) Following my dream continuing being a circus performer and until then hopefully finding a job that can fund me till then.(if anyone knows of one of those that would also be great)

Or B) Choosing the easier route and stick with college, but giving up on my dream(this however is probably the more safe choice)

TL;DR (Follow my dream or take the safe route?)

Thank you for reading!"

I've battled with insomnia for the last 13-14 years or so and I'm only 26. I had some issues with drugs when I was a teenager and witnesses a few fairly horrific things that have never left my mind. I've recovered though...I haven't done any drugs aside from smoking weed since I was 18 and I've lived on my own and supported myself for the last 9 years and managed to maintain healthy relationships and friendships throughout.

Bad decision in my youth and lack of motivation or direction lead me to drop out, so I've struggled to get ahead for many years. After dropping out I traveled aimlessly for about a year and returned to my home town and lived on minimum wage doing whatever I could - washing dishes, telemarketing etc. 

I was in a long term relationship in which we lived together for about 4 and a half years - from the ages of 19-23. It wasn't a great relationship and it should have lasted about half as long but we both became complacent, and in the end it ended up holding me back from trying to get my shit together and start going to school so I could make some progress in my life.

When I broke up with her she took everything - pretty much all of our money, the bed, the furniture, the dishes etc. I was left with my computer on a desk, a guitar, my clothes and a few blankets. I was 23 years old and had no idea what to do with myself. I felt stuck.

I had finally gotten a decent paying full time job about 2 years before that, so after I ended that relationship I worked my ass off working overtime and any other odd jobs I could find to save money so I could move out of the town I was in and start going to school. I always wanted to move to the west coast - Oregon or Washington. Where I lived made me miserable and I was sick of struggling for so long and it motivated me to work my ass off to get somewhere better.

A little under a year after I had ended that relationship I had a decent amount of money saved up and I was figuring out where I wanted to go to school, for what, student loans and etc. I was finally going to make some progress in life and I felt more excited than I had felt about anything since I could remember. 

I met a girl completely randomly online one night. We got close despite our distance of about 800 miles. She traveled to see me not long after we met online so we could meet in person and we got closer and closer from there. We started a long distance relationship. I'd never felt so close to somebody.

About a year ago last July I was suffering with some depression and some severe insomnia issues and I got pneumonia. Around this time I posted something to /r/insomnia trying to express my frustration and get some things out. My health did recover, but I was scared for a while. It kept getting worse and worse and I felt like I was slipping into insanity. 

I ended up having to use almost all the money I had saved for medical bills so after I recovered I was back to the beginning. My girlfriend stayed with me despite the distance and despite not knowing me for very long and without even thinking twice she was there for me as much as she could be. After I recovered I made as much effort as I could to see her but more often than not she would take the time and the effort to travel and to spend more money so we could spend time together because I was living paycheck to paycheck. I ended up owing taxes and it put me farther behind. My girlfriend helped me financially in a few situations and never questioned being with me. I appreciated it more than anything.

I was able to save a bit of money up after a period of time but it wasn't enough to move. My girlfriend knew how much it would improve my life and how much it would mean to me if I were to be able to move out of there and have another chance and she gave me that chance. She gave me money to help me move.

I moved to Tacoma, Washington in September.

She had to go to work for an internship far away as soon as I moved here though, so it continued to be a long distance relationship BUT only for 8 more months - until May, 2013, at which point she would come back home and we would only be about 2 hours from one another. I was moving away from my home town, all of my family and all of my friends and everything I knew so I could be happier, improve my life, go to school and be closer to her. She had put so much effort into our relationship I figured that was the least I could do. She put everything into it, and it was my turn.

I've just looked forward to starting school and her being done with the internship and coming back home so we can be close and actually have a non-long distance relationship.

When I moved here I moved in with a friend and slept on his couch. I couldn't find a job for a few months, and even now I've only managed to find a part time job. My friend and I managed to move into a 2 bedroom apartment in December, so now I'm on the lease and I'm responsible for half of the rent. My expectations were unrealistic for how long it would take to find a job when I moved and I've been struggling financially since I got here.

In the last few months since I've been here my computer ( which was my only solid form of communication with my girlfriend. ) died and I couldn't afford to have anything more than a tracphone. I was unable to keep the contact with her that I wanted to. She was getting frustrated that I was still not finding a job and making progress and I started to feel resented. I just wanted to be stable and not stress about things and it was causing me to delve into depression. We grew distant and not being able to communicate when we wanted didn't help. 

At the beginning of December she met somebody else that lived far away from her but was working at the same company for an internship. They got close, and she never told him that she had a boyfriend. After a week of them getting close in an inappropriate way she broke up with me on the internet two weeks before she was supposed to come home for Christmas and see me. She told me she still felt exactly the same about me but she needed to see that I was getting myself together and she couldn't handle a long distance relationship where we rarely talked and I was constantly struggling. She said she wanted to be with with me again when I was stable. I asked her if there was somebody else and she said no, but there was - and the next day she started fooling around with him. 

We didn't speak for about a week, I sat in my room heartbroken and depressed. My roomate is my only friend here and he's busy but talking to him occasionally has helped a bit.

The week after we split up she contacted me and cried and told me everything that happened and how horrible she felt and that the guy she met ended up being a scumbag. I had no idea what to think. I was only the second person she had ever been with. We didn't have sex until we had known each other for almost a year and she required an STD test before we ever got involved like that. She was VERY careful and had a lot of self respect. It was completely unlike her. I was heartbroken and hurt. My trust had been destroyed. She agreed to see me in person when she came home for Christmas, and I saw her twice on her week long break. It was emotional and nothing really felt resolved - it was just confusing. She told me her feelings haven't changed but she can't be in a relationship with me. She acted like we were dating again when we were together and it was incredibly confusing. She wants distance now, and we haven't talked much. I'm still confused and hurt. Tonight we talked for a bit and I told her that I'm confused because what she did after she broke up with me wasn't something I would expect from her because I always thought she was so classy. She flipped out and said fuck you and I assume she'll never talk to me again.

I still can't find more than a part time job and I'm getting into bad territory. My phone stopped working a few days ago and I have $3 to my name and no food. I need my phone for the only job I have right now so I'm probably going to lose the job. I haven't eaten in 3 days. I don't know how I'm going to pay rent next month. I was supposed to start school on the 28th but there's no possible way of that happening now. Everything is hopeless. 

My roomate started dating a girl about 6 days ago and ever since then I've had to listen to them fuck constantly. When I'm able to suppress the tears to go get some water from the kitchen or something I have to awkwardly interrupt them having romantic dinners and etc. He hasn't really talked to me since he started dating her. I sit in my room alone crying and he's enjoying himself with his new girlfriend. Nobody has asked me ""what's wrong"", I feel like he wants nothing to do with me because I'd ruin his mood. I have no friends here,I have no money, no car and nobody close to me anymore. I have nowhere to go to even try to escape and take my mind off of things. I don't know what to do. I can't stop shaking or crying. 

Any time things start to look up it all crashes down on top of me again and ends up worse than it was before. I'm probably going to be homeless in a matter of a month or less. I just wanted to be stable and be happy.

I'm not suicidal. I couldn't do it. Maybe if I had no family that loved and cared about me and I was all alone in the world but I couldn't do that to them and I feel like it's kind of cowardly. I can't help but wish that the world really would have ended on December 21st though...or a plane from Seatac would have engine failure and come crashing down on my apartment and disintegrate me into nothing. I'm just sick of being alone and being in pain.

16dap2,14,2013-01-11,Just got my first real job and it happens to be in tech support. Any hints for me as I embark on this treacherous journey?,Chizzoink,computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/16dap2/just_got_my_first_real_job_and_it_happens_to_be/,"Well, by a wondrous stroke of luck (and some persuading from my girlfriend), I applied for a job listed on Craigslist, got a call the next day, got interviewed, went on to the second interview, and got the job along with one other, less tech-savvy guy.

I had held an intern position at my old school district for 3 summers in a row plus September to December (until they ran out of money and had to let the interns go). It allowed me to learn about hardware and troubleshooting and such, but only limited to the fleet of computers we had. I had never dealt with viruses and such. 

I consider myself very adept at working with hardware and I can hold my own when it comes to software.

Our company is more of an on-call place, where people call in and either bring in their computer to be repaired or we'll go out to their house and fix it. It's solely a tech support company, not a parts sales company (although we attempt to sell parts in addition to services).

At my new job (which I'm still in training for), I'll be required to do opening stuff, check in customer's computers as they come in for appointments, fix said computers, ship some off to be repaired if the repairs are more serious, and just all around manage the shop while the other employee works out in the field.

I'm not sure what else to put here. So if you need more info, just ask! Thanks for any input!

**EDIT:** Thanks for everything so far! I'm gonna compile a list of all the main points and hang onto that while I work."
16d9id,6,2013-01-11,Need some advice!,eloraw,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/16d9id/need_some_advice/,"So, last summer I bit the bullet and really committed to some weight loss. I am 23 years old, 5'9 and my heaviest weight was 235lbs. During the summer i began calorie counting and working out regularly. By the end of the two months my weight dropped to 205lbs. Over the fall I became really busy with internship and didn't have a chance to get to the gym at all. However my life style is very active. I was up and moving all the time with kids, teaching creative movement to 3-6 year olds etc. I also kept up my healthy eating habits. (Don't get me wrong, i definitely cheated every once in a while) but over those 4 months I maintained the weight of 205. 

Dec 27th I headed back to the gym. My goal was to get back on the weight loss train and try to shed some more weight as my goal weight is around 175. When I go to the gym I do about 30 minutes of weights and core strengthening. (100 sit ups, stretching, and some upper and lower body weights) I then do 30 minutes of running as I am doing the a 5k training program through an app I downloaded. (I run approx 3-3.5kms in the 30 minutes). 
I also began calorie counting again keeping my daily caloric intake below 1200. In the past two weeks I have gone over this amount 3 times however I have not exceeded 2000 calories in a day. 
My diet: Generally for lunch I have a sandwich or wrap with lean meat and lots of vegetables and always on a whole grain wrap or bread. and for supper its usually a lean meat with a large side of vegetables/salad. When I snack i usually snack on fruit and vegetables or nuts and dried fruit. I drink mainly water with the odd diet coke if I want to treat myself. 

My question to everyone out there: Why have I gained almost 5lbs since being back in the healthy routine these past 2 weeks?!

any ideas? Let me know if I missed anything about my routine...."

We've all known each other for about 3-4 years and we're all around 25 and we all go to grad school. Two of us are in each room. Lillian and Marissa live together while I live with Shauna. We all paid the same fee for the apartment. We're only living in this specific place for a two semester period since we all go to our hometowns for the summer or internships usually/

Lillian moved in first. The rest of us showed up later. Turned out that one room is much bigger than the other. We had no idea they were unequal sizes until we got there.

Fast forward to during winter break. Shauna and I had talked a few times about asking about switching but we never did. My roommate suggested that during winter break, we could just move everyones stuff and switch without having to tell Lillian and Marissa.

This is where I was stupid. I told myself doing that would be a prick move. But then I convinced myself that was the only way to do it because of two reasons:

1. Lillian is a OCD type person who gets partly irritated by small things and every year I lived with her, she comes first thing during move-in week to pick the bed and etc.
2. We had mentioned it to Marissa in passing and she had said no. I mentioned it to Lillian through text and she said she was laughing.

So I convinced myself that if we had directly asked them, the answer would be a no and they might even padlock the door or something. Our logic the whole time was that since we had all paid the same price, we each should get the bigger room for one semester.

Anyways, so I still had doubts about switching the stuff without telling them. So this was what we did. We got to the apartment and tidied our stuff and moved everything to the living room. Marissa wanted to switch the stuff without telling them, but I really felt that would destroy our friendships beyond recognition. So I txted Lillian and Shauna, telling them that we wanted to switch. I told Lillian that we had moved our stuff in the living room and we were happy to move all the stuff for her or if she could come and do it with us if she wanted to. Marissa said she was fine with it but to make sure with Lillian.

Lillian responded angrily that she did not agree with it and it was completely ridiculous and shady. I responded that it only made sense since we all paid the same fee.

The conversation came out to be that Lillian sounded pissed that we hadn't asked her before and to her, it seemed shady. I told her that I didn't want to switch the stuff without her knowing and I didn't want to touch her stuff. I told her that all of our stuff was in the living room and she could move her own stuff to the smaller room and then we would move our stuff to the larger room later on in the week. She stopped the conversation by saying that she was hurt and a bit shocked by this and we would talk later.

Anyways, I really realized that I should have listened to my conscience and told Shauna in the very beginning that we weren't going to do anything unless we asked them directly. The worse part is, Lillian is obviously made at me because I did all the texting and asking and it looks like it's all my idea.

Any advice on where to go from here in terms of repairing my relationship with Lillian? Also, are we in the wrong for assuming we all should get a shake at the bigger room?

TLDR: Other roommates had bigger room for one semester. My roommate and I planned to switch our belongings without them knowing. However, I backed out and only moved our stuff to the living room and txted the other roommates to tell them that we wanted the bigger room. Advice on what we should have done and where to go from here?"
16d3l5,0,2013-01-11,"Possible anxiety[F24] straining relationship with SO [M26], help/advice? ",LupoCattivo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16d3l5/possible_anxietyf24_straining_relationship_with/,"This might not be the right subreddit, but I'm not sure where else to start... I've[F24] been dating my SO[M26] for a year and my self diagnosed anxiety keeps straining our relationship. I am calling and scheduling an appointment with a therapist first thing in the morning, but in the mean time I need help. 

Ever since I spent the summer at an internship where  90% of the time outside of work I was miserable, I've developed some kind of anxiety disorder (again, seeing a therapist as soon as possible). I start to worry profusely when I text my SO and don't get a reply until several hours later. I have trouble listening to him and digesting what he says without starting to panic internally, thus appearing that I haven't heard a word, or don't believe him. I'm terrified that as a result, he's going to get to the point of frustration that he leaves me. 

We've had multiple tiffs about my neediness for attention and my worrying about him not replying, plus other silly things(which we sum up as craziness), but usually can use them as a stepping stone to grow stronger together. The last month was great. No tiffs. Until tonight…

The past week he was at a workshop, splitting a hotel room with a female coworker.  And I trust him completely; I trust that he would never cheat on me. But yet, I was uncomfortable with the situation. Which lead to several small anxiety ""freak-outs"". But I wanted him to trust that I was trying to get over the ""craziness"" that I developed, so I didn't say anything to him about the situation until tonight while he was driving home. That's when hell broke loose. He assumes that my uncomfortableness was due to the fact that I was jealous, which thus means I do not trust him. (Jealousy is a huge deal breaker for him, as he feels that jealousy means lack of trust.) I tried to reason with him that I was not jealous, and that I trusted him completely, but that got us nowhere. We ended the call with the agreement that I should seek help (to address this anxiety, or whatever it might be), but I'm terrified that I won't be able to get over this ""disability"" (for lack of a better word) and that I will lose him. I've been sobbing to the point no more tears will come :(

How do I show that I DO trust him? Does anyone have any suggestions to cope with the anxiety so it doesn’t ruin our relationship? Was I wrong to be uncomfortable with him sharing a hotel room with a female coworker? Sorry for the length of this post, I needed to get this out, its been a rough night so far :(

TL:DR [F24] anxiety is straining relationship with SO[M26]. Things got nasty tonight when I told him I was not comfortable with him sharing a hotel room with a [F] coworker, he viewed that as jealousy, and I swear it's not. I'm terrified my anxiety will ruin our relationship. Help?

16d2zu,0,2013-01-11,I'm [f23] sick of my boyfriend's [25] mother [~50],manicrysis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16d2zu/im_f23_sick_of_my_boyfriends_25_mother_50/,"So, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year (10 months to the day of this post). Now, I've had some other posts bringing up issues in our own relationship. But never including his mother. This is really the final straw. 

First, I'll explain some of the difficulties in his own relationship with her. He lived with his parents up until March or so of last year. The parents moved out leaving my boyfriend and his twin brother the house. The boys pay rent on the house ($300 each) and their father pays the rest (approximately the same amount). The boys also pay utilities. There was no written lease. There is only a small sheet of paper saying the boys would pay rent with their signature. My boyfriend was never allowed to read the paper, only was able to sign it (I'm not sure of the reason, I can only assume). 

Now, this doesn't seem like there should be an issue here. Only that their mom constantly bitches about rent and how they should be paying more, and constantly wants it to be known that they couldn't find any place cheaper (aside note: they can). She always expects them to be grateful for *everything* she does for them. And they are. However, the mother takes it to an extreme. She's constantly badgering them about it. On top of this, she always complains about buying the boys groceries all the time. However, they never ask for help and she just brings them food whenever she feels like they need it. Yes, it's a nice gesture. But she constantly complains and holds it over their heads that she buys them groceries.

On top of all this, she has overstepped her boundaries constantly. I live an hour away from my boyfriend. And until this Spring, I haven't had a car to drive for years (anxiety issues after accidents - not completely relevant here). Anyway, I'm going to have a car. So, over this year he has been awesome and drives to see me for a day, or picks me up and takes me to his house for the weekend (sometimes longer). Here's where the issues started. 

She learned that I smoke (she does, too). And bitches at my boyfriend about it. Because he hated it when she smoked because she would smell up the whole house. I don't smoke inside their house and I never would. He hates the fact that I smoke, but we make it work because I've constantly said ""I'm going to stop smoking for me and not because of you."" He accepted that and we moved on. However, his mother can't understand that. She thinks I'm a bad person because I'm overweight, I smoke, and apparently laze around the house all day. 

She makes an issue of my ""issues"" and bitches at my boyfriend (okay, I'm getting sick of writing ""my boyfriend"", so now his name will be Carl) even while he's at work. She complains that I need to ""earn my keep"" while I'm there. That I should vacuum and clean the entire house. I have no problems cleaning the house while I'm there. And to say the house needs cleaned all the time is an overstatement. That place is *spotless*, practically. I do their laundry (especially since I shower and use their towels). And I do their dishes for them (it's a dishwasher, but I would do them if they didn't have one). As a matter of fact, when I'm over at my friends' houses, I wash their dishes if there's a pile up, or clean their bathtub because it's absolutely disgusting. I can't stand sitting in a dirty place. Anyhow, she constantly complains that I never do anything. 

Once she texted him, ""She's fat, smokes, and sleeps all day. What a life to lead..."" And I'm just going to put this out there, she's had plastic surgery. And she is by far not thin. I admit I'm overweight, and I'm working on that. But she constantly cuts me down to Carl. And for the record, that's never bothered me. It's the fact that she's overstepping her boundaries and interfering in our relationship. 

I'll tell you a story. I made a friend on the internet from California, who was coming to my hometown for an internship. Anyway, her and Carl met. And since Carl lives in the nearest city, her and I made plans to visit Carl and his brother for the weekend. Everything was okay with the boys. So, this happens over the course of the summer. Well, one weekend, while Carl was at work, their mother came over. Anyway, she made big exaggerations about how we were basically living there (it was only once or twice a month) and that we need to start paying rent (or something, I don't remember much, I was seething the entire time, biting my tongue). She kicks us out. And my friend and I go to a mutual friend's house to get away. 

Okay, so there's that. She's overstepped her bounds countless times. There was one time where she complained about me getting her sons sick because I was putting my toothbrush where their's were. Okay, I'll give her that. Sure, except that neither of them were sick. I stopped putting my toothbrush there for my own sake of not having to deal with that anymore. Another incident: I'm lactose intolerant and only drink organic milk. So, I always bring my own milk (sometimes I accidentally leave it there, but it doesn't entirely matter, because it doesn't go bad as fast as other milks). Usually, I get back to be able to use more of it and eventually throw it away. She complains that I'm basically living there because of this. 

I'm going to get to my last straw now. Carl's brakes are acting funny and his father is a mechanic. So, we go over to their house with our food (because Carl hasn't eaten all day) and let his dad fix the brakes. For the first half hour I'm there, she's talking to Carl, complaining about me like I'm not even there. I don't want to get involved, so I bite my tongue. Now, you might say ""Why didn't he stand up for you?"" He *does*. *She* never listens. **EVER**. She just continues on her high horse and just keeps going. Eventually, I gave Carl the rest of my food because I was so nauseated I couldn't eat anymore. Then, not even five minutes after she's done with that conversation, she shows me a baby picture *and* ask me which one is Carl. What? Really? You're going to act all nice to me like you weren't just bitching about me?

I know a lot of you might say, ""OP, you need to speak up!"" I know. But I haven't because I have absolutely nothing productive to say to her. I know if I say something, I'm just going to go on a rampage. So, I bite my tongue and don't say anything at all. 

Now, the last and final straw (for me). I'm at my house and I get a text message. It's Carl. He says that she is accusing him of seeing other people. Apparently, she got on his call log history and found a number she didn't know. They were two calls. He didn't answer because he didn't know who it was. And they never left a message. This woman (his mother) *pays* $1.99 to get the name of the person who called the wrong number! He's never even known anyone by this name! Who does that? First of all, it's his business. Second of all, shouldn't she be happy if he was seeing other people? She hates me and constantly complains about me. 

Anyway, that's pretty much it for me. I want to know what my boyfriend can do short of moving out and cutting all ties (he can't right now due to other reasons). The only solution I can come up with is Carl and his brother move out of the house and into an apartment that's not controlled by their ridiculous mother. 

So, what should I do? How should I react when she does this type of stuff again? How can I help my boyfriend?

**TL;DR** Boyfriend's mother is becoming a monster-in-law and I can't stand it. She constantly oversteps her boundaries in our relationship and tears me down constantly. I don't know what to do, what to tell my boyfriend, or even how to react anymore. I'm pretty much done with her.

I'm going to be a junior this upcoming Spring semester, and I recently declared as a Business major with a concentration in Finance. I don't know much about Finance yet (only taken one course), but I'm interested and excited to try and make a career out of it.

So, I go to a small/private liberal arts school that has a really cool 'Student Managed Fund' class. This class is monitored by a professor, but the students make ALL the final decisions about investing 5 million dollars!! It looks great on a resume!! In order to get into this class, you have to fill out an application, write a 4 pg essay, and pass an interview by the teacher. I think only 20% of the students who apply are selected.

My Situation:

I skipped this last semester and worked as an intern, to boost my resume and earn a little cash. With this little bit of cash (about $3000), I really really want to invest it somehow. I think if I can do this successfully it will help me a lot for getting selected for the 'Student Managed Fund' course. Also, being a noob and all, I think I will learn about investing in the process.

SO REDDIT.. WHAT SHOULD I DO TO INVEST MY MULAH??

16cyce,4,2013-01-10,To my first love,emzmurcko,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/16cyce/to_my_first_love/,"D,

So I’ve had some time to gather my thoughts. I was wanting to talk to you when you got back, because while you were gone I had time to think about everything. This was before you had called me.

 I was thinking about how you don’t make me feel good. I always felt like I was putting so much effort into everything and you couldn’t give a fuck. I loved you, and cared for you a lot for like almost six months. I can’t ever say I was in love with you though, because before I got the chance you pulled that first bullshit on me with the manic episode at my house and I could never actually trust you fully again. Granted, I have trust issues... but I was attached to you at the very least. Which was mostly my fault for letting it happen, partially your fault for fostering it, but kinda no one’s fault because I think it was somewhat out of our control and pretty much bound to occur. 

I knew you didn’t feel the same way about me. I knew you never loved me the same way I loved you. Always. But I ignored it, because you were comfortable, even though the thought fucking hurt. And as much as all of my friends and family thought you were a scumbag, told me not to waste another tear on you, that I’m better than you, I always protested. I would tell them you cared about me as they rolled their eyes, but dutifully listened. I made a fool of myself, every time I would call the same round of people after you did something to make me cry. Then they would all come over and we’d get fucked up on whatever substances people brought and the girls would declare that none of us needed men anymore.  The guys would tell me I was too great of a catch, you didn’t deserve me. “They don’t know our relationship,” I’d always think to myself.

Then something would happen, you’d come over, we’d have sex, the cycle would start again. I let it happen. Even though it wore me the fuck out. People noticed. My grades this semester were the worst they’ve ever been. I missed the most amount of classes, ever, because I was so unable to focus. I was more anxious and depressed then I was since the last time I was in the hospital. I kept trying to snap myself out of it, force myself to get my shit together, and it just wasn’t happening. I’d been on an upward swing, so it was frustrating. I knew in my mind that the only thing that had changed in my life was the fact that I’d been in a new relationship. But I ignored that rational fact as well. 

The last night we saw each other, you dumped all this news on me that you were going travelling, I wasn’t going to see you for weeks, etc etc. That was during my vacation, and I guess that showed that you weren’t taking me into consideration, or making me a priority in your life. Not to mention the fact that you were going to see J, and obviously hook up with her. But we weren’t boyfriend and girlfriend, and while you were gone I hooked up a few times too. B, S, a new guy who leads the T's on NYE. I wanted to prove to myself I’m fine without you, too. Also in the back of my mind was the fact that you said you were planning on moving this summer. I honestly was skeptical as to whether or not you would actually follow through, but either way, there was no way I was going with you, and if we kept on this way I would have just been delaying the pain of saying goodbye while getting more and more attached as time passed.

You called me Thursday morning, I thought you were going to suggest plans for the day. We’d left on a pretty good note, I thought it might be nice to see you. Instead you told me that you’d gotten back together with your ex-girlfriend who lives in another country. What. The. Fuck. Are you fucking serious? I am shocked. I cannot believe, even after everything, that you could do something like that to me. The words felt physical. After everything I’d done for you, put myself out there, let you fuck with me for so long, you come at me like THAT? D, you knew you were stringing me along this whole time, and you really just don’t give a fuck. I let you know how deeply I cared for you, how sincerely I wanted you to be happy. And you seriously just gave me the finger in return. Don’t try to tell me that you care about me now, or ever, because no decent human being does that to another. Not to mention the fact that you decided to be a coward and tell me over the phone JUST LIKE THE LAST TIME. I asked you if you had anything else you wanted to say and barely whispered, “Sorry?” You should be ashamed of yourself. I don’t surround myself with people who have a negative attitude and are so uncaring. You have treated me with such disrespect and insensitivity since I’ve known you, and I’ve just put up with it, because of my own fucked up head and insecurities. But I’m better than that. I guess I should have wised up the first things fucked up between us, but I’m a person in a state of constant denial.  You really fucked up things up between us with that phone call. I’m not gonna say I’d have a different reaction if you’d manned up and told me in person, or at least worded it a little more tactfully, but at least I’d respect you for it and we maybe we could’ve talked again sometime.

You hurt me extremely deeply, but I’ve made a conscious decision to bounce back. I refuse going to fuck up my last semester in college, I just got an amazing internship, I just turned 21, I have friends and family who love me, and there are plenty more guys out there who are interested in me. I always get what I want when I set my mind to it. And I certainly don’t need to be wasting any more time and energy on a person who doesn’t even show me respect or reciprocate effort. I definitely deserve someone who is crazy about me, and would choose me over anyone else.  That’s not you. 

We are not friends, D. We were never friends. And together, we discovered we are not meant to be a couple. We are lovers. We are only meant to be lovers. That’s all I want from you, all I wanted. I don’t want to make it sound like we never had any good times; we shared a lot and I don’t regret the fun we had. I learned a lot about myself from being with you, and I can appreciate that. 

I honestly wish you the best. Good luck finding a new job, and seriously take the time you have off now to work on yourself. Don’t just fuck around, be productive. I know it’s scary to think about when you’ve been on autopilot for so long (not to mention how cliché it sounds) but really take a look at who you are now, and what you want to be. Do work to better yourself. Continue with your professional mental health help, it’s going to be really important for you in the long run. Think about what I’ve said, I hope it makes you understand—not just know—that there are other people in the world, with feelings. Not just you. Learn from this. Maybe next time you won’t fuck up so badly.

16cvmw,3,2013-01-10,My ex and I share the same friend group... I don't think I can handle seeing him so much...,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16cvmw/my_ex_and_i_share_the_same_friend_group_i_dont/,"I [20f] met him [21m] over a year ago. We started as friends, became friends with benefits, and by last summer it had become so much more than that. We both claimed we didn't want a relationship but that's what it turned into. There was no fighting it. He became my best friend and the person I felt the closest to.

And it was wonderful. I'd always cheated on boyfriends before but this time I was so content to only be with him. I actually felt myself falling in love.

But at one point things started going wrong. Basically it was a series of stupid insecurities, distrust, and suspicions of him seeing other girls (he had cheated on his previous girlfriend with me). In fact, he had lied to me about this same ex-girlfriend spending an entire afternoon in his room. He was bailing on me almost every single night for his friends (and her). I was feeling so lonely and sad all of the time, and I convinced myself that breaking up with him would somehow improve my life. So I did.

For the next few weeks my heartache got the better of me and I wound up sleeping with him. A few times. Those mornings-after were terrible, so awkward and loveless, that I knew it would never be like it was. The last time he asked me to come over, I politely declined. That's when we stopped talking completely.

This was almost two months ago.

The problem is that we've always shared the same group of close knit friends. Since we broke up, I see him everywhere. Every weekend I'm dreading the prospect of him walking through the door. The second he arrives I feel my smile fade and this sadness descends and sucks out all of my energy.

He acts like I don't exist. I'll say hello and he'll look at me then turn away. We were all walking to a concert and I asked him about an internship he had applied for. He just walked away and started chatting it up with some other girl. He'll leave the party and walk right past me without even a ""bye"".

It's breaking my heart. I miss our friendship and it's so exhausting to see him constantly dangled in front of me but so far out of reach. I don't feel any progress at all getting over him. The constant crying is actually painful. I've never run out of tears before.

But I can't avoid him. I would never see my friends if I evaded every party I knew he'd be at. Tonight I'm supposed to go see all of my friends that I haven't hung out with in over a month. But I know he'll be there. So I'm at home sobbing typing this and just dreading having to go there and hold back tears the entire time.

I don't know what to do. I'm still in love with him and to sit in the same room as him and be completely ignored... but I love my friends even more.

I guess this ended up just being a rant but any words of advice/comfort? Right now I'm trying to muster the courage to go to this apartment but right now I'd rather stay at home crying.

Maybe I do deserve to just be ignored. It makes more sense to feel isolated *outside* of a relationship rather than in one... right?"

I am currently on my second internship with a company. I have been with them since the beginning of last summer so about 8 months. It was a summer internship which turned into part time when I went back to school.

The thing is that Im not really happy working here. It has nothing to do with the people but just with the type of work Im doing. I don't find it challenging and its very boring for me. Its a manufacturing position which turned into working with quality department.I go in and the only thing I think about is leaving that place. The last internship I had I absolutely loved and I left it to try a new company. 

Saying that I dont see myself working full time with this company when I graduate. I do all my work and I am told that I do great work but Im pretty much there in order to get some extra cash while Im at a school. I could go my last semester without the extra cash though. 

So what are your suggestions? Should I quit? I dont have any other jobs lined up when I graduate so Im just kinda worried that if I quit I wont find anything.

When I got here, I decided to switch to CS, and the switch added two additional quarters to the expected two years to graduate (two years plus two quarters total).  What this means is that I'm cramming a lot of complex concepts in a short period of time, and it seems like I have very little time to comfortably complete outside projects.  However I decided to begin working on a simple iPhone game with a few friends that we are hoping to release by the end of the school year in June.

Unlike a lot of younger CS students, I actually have a lot of other kinds of work experience under my belt.  I worked at Wells Fargo for a year, a recording studio for four years prior to moving to go to UCSC.  My questions are:

-Should I put on my resume the fact that I'm working on an iOS game, but that it's not yet submitted to the app store?

-Should I list the languages that I know given the fact that I have no previous work experience?

-Should I provide school projects or courses that are relevant to computer science?  For instance I wrote a simple compiler in C for a simple C-like language, an AI simulation of simple creatures on a three-dimensional plane, etc.  (I would put these on GitHub but they are assignments that other students could potentially search for...)

I won't have trouble filling the page, I just want to know what I should emphasize and what I shouldn't.  School takes up a huge portion of my time since I finished me GEs at community college, so the workload for me has been pretty intense.  Any guidance would be appreciated!

I can afford to support myself with my current income, but am afraid that should my entrepreneurial passions go sour, it would be very difficult to find a full-time job that would utilize my experience. 

A full-time job is attractive to me because it would allow me to gain more self-discipline, obtain more experience and have greater income security. However, I am the type of person who likes to put 100% into everything and know I would sacrifice my business plans to meet my employer's expectations. I hear about people struggling to get out of the corporate world to start businesses and wonder if not getting involved in it at all would be a better route. 

I do not know which option is more profitable in the long run, either. My current business is a blog network that earns most income from affiliate advertising (pretty classy, nothing spammy).

So, yeah. I don't really like life - nor the universe. there're very few things that make me happy and I don't feel like living for them is really worth it.

I'm a college student stuck on a few disciplines. After I get over them, I'll graduate, probably go after a masters degree and start all over again. Then again for phd. And then I'll probably get a job as a professor/researcher and things won't change much.

It's not that I'm being forced on academic life, I just have horror to the industry, I don't want to be a white-collar. I barely have discipline to go to the internship every day and I don't feel that'll change once I graduate.

And I kinda like my area. I used to be very enthusiastic about it, reading books as a hobby and then passing some disciplines with horrid attendance just because I already knew everything on the test and a few things more. If I really studied, I'd be already graduated and maybe even some kind of semi-prodigy.

Still, I don't feel motivated. The thoughts of how my life will continue dread me. I don't want to sound like a lazy bun, but the thought of going to work every weekday dreads me. I'm *very* uncomfortable with leaving home. Working from home as a freelancer also isn't a option because of my lack of discipline.

I want to stay in my bedroom sleeping and resting. Even if I'm not really happy with this, that's something I don't want to lose. Rather, the thought of having the life described above and ""enjoying"" it is somewhat scary. I feel like if I did this, I wouldn't be myself anymore. If I were to disappear, I'd rather do it as I am instead of being transformed in something I don't want to.

Please PM me if you, or someone you know has any available positions.

Thanks a ton,

My university requires 500 hours of clinical work for graduation. I've been looking at the BBS Statutes and it's quite vague about the kind of organization I can work for as a student. It just says ""not a private practice"". What does that mean, exactly? Does the place I work for have to be a non-profit? What should I be looking for in an internship site? I've asked my program head and she essentially told me to Google ""Counseling Center""."

I love this subreddit, and instead of lurking I finally have something to contribute. I'm currently a sophomore studying Environmental Science (focus on Ecology) and working in a wood anatomy lab. I'm applying for this amazing internship my school offers over the summer, and of course they need a personal statement. I'm great at interviews, but writing this is driving me insane! They say that want you to tel them about yourself, your career goals, interest in research, and expectations. I know the answers to all of these things, but for some reason I am having an immense amount of trouble getting it out on paper. Do you ladies have any advice on writing a personal statement, both content and structure of it, or anything related?

Thank you!"
16g711,1,2013-01-12,[22/M]Confused about a situation with an ex [21/F] over the recent...chapter of my life. (Forgive the life story),[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16g711/22mconfused_about_a_situation_with_an_ex_21f_over/,"**Background:** I've known this girl since we were sophomores in high school. We shared a friendship that grew into mutual attraction before we started dating for a majority of that year. We broke it off (rather roughly) our junior year as she suddenly transferred to a boarding school across the state. Our SENIOR year, she moved back, we went to prom, graduated, got back together, etc. etc. Needless to say, by this point, we had developed quite an attachment to each other.

**Fast Forward to college**. It was obvious things wouldn't work out as distance became an issue. We grew apart. It didn't take long before I broke things off rather abruptly. As close as we were, it would be quite a while before I felt comfortable with opening up to another girl. With her, however, within a month, she was seeing another guy. It ended up being about a year and a half before we really talked again. 

**Summer 2011**, she calls me, tells me she's in town for a few days and wants to get together to catch up. I agree. She stands me up on the night before her flight leaves and I don't hear from her.

**Christmas 2011**, she sends me a text explaining how depressed she'd become since starting college and how I was the only person she felt she could trust/turn to about it. I respond, briefly asking what was going on. No response.

**Spring 2012**, I have an emergency surgery. She somehow finds out about it through the magic of social networks and texts me out of the blue in a panic to see how I was doing.

**Summer 2012**, She calls again. She's in town for another couple of days, wants to hang out before she starts an internship elsewhere. No response from any of my attempts to get in touch with her and she leaves a message letting me know that she left a few days early to travel with her sister but she'd be back occasionally throughout the summer. Nope. Spent the remainder of it in Texas.

By the middle of the summer I'm pretty much done with whatever she's doing and I delete her number and unfriend her on facebook. While this was once a person I cared for deeply, I simply couldn't deal with the emotional fallout from whatever mind games she was playing.

This past semester in school, I really let go of it all with her. I actually hit it off with someone new right towards the end of the semester, which was a huge deal for me. As luck would have it, though, about a week before Christmas I get a random call on my cell phone from a number I certainly don't recognize. Surprise. Once again, she shows up out of the blue, informing me that she's in town indefinitely and that she ""absolutely needs to see my face"". At this point, whatever offers she brings to the table are met purely with cynicism. I literally don't want to deal with her outside of simply clarifying what the fuck she's doing ignoring me if she wants to see me so bad. For six days, we go through this pathetic cycle of making plans and her backing out at the last minute with these embarrassing excuses that I don't want to hear anymore mainly because I know her best friend and they'd been hanging out since she'd been in town. 

On one of the last instances of her contacting ME I decide to call her out on it, seeing as how this was an extremely rare opportunity. She apologizes knowing how pathetic it must seem. She admits she's scared. She knew it would be hard but she didn't expect it to play out like it did. 

Last thing I heard from her. After New Years I find out that she literally went out with some local friends and got absolutely wasted while club hopping. 

Why is she doing this? Is she trying to drag me along? Are there residual feelings involved? I don't mean to sound selfish but I've been dealing with this fallout for far too long. All I want at this point is clarity.

**TL;DR**
Ex constantly wants to meet up. Ignores/blows off every single time for 2-3 years. Tells me she's scared. What does she keep contacting me for if this is the only outcome?"

16fzn2,6,2013-01-12,[help] social anxiety is keeping me from asking teachers for recommendations!,redirie,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/16fzn2/help_social_anxiety_is_keeping_me_from_asking/,"I have two internships that have been offered to me; I just need to complete the application materials and get several recommendations. I have four teachers who really like me and know I'm very capable. Somehow I just can't bring myself to ask them for the recommendations though. It feels like such a big favour to be asking someone to essentially praise me and it makes me feel really uncomfortable. Also, school doesn't start until Monday but even then I only have class with one of the four teachers and I only have the emails of two others; is it okay to ask for a recommendation via email? None of them have regular office hours. Not wanting to do it via email is another reason I've been putting this off for almost a week now when I should be doing it ASAP.

Also, it doesn't help that one of the teachers (my favourite, actually) invited me to her New Year's Party and unfortunately I brought my boyfriend and he ended up getting sick because his alcohol tolerance is basically zilch, he was tired from a long day of work and we were spinning around dancing. It was pretty embarrassing but she and her family were very nice about it; still, I intended to write an email to her apologizing and thanking her for the lovely party a day or two after but I never did because I am just so anxious about talking to teachers even though I **know** I am her favourite student. Now I feel like it will be even more unacceptable to ask for a recommendation for her without at least writing the apology/thank you first; I've been thinking about lying and saying my email didn't send it for some reason and that I'd meant to send it about a week ago but I'm not sure what to do.

I really need to get over this anxiety because it could potentially hold me back from two internships that I could really use! Please help. :(

16fxyw,1,2013-01-12,Will a 'more prestigious' MSW degree matter once I relocate?,[deleted],socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/16fxyw/will_a_more_prestigious_msw_degree_matter_once_i/,"Hi everyone. I'm a senior psychology major looking to get my MSW in the near future to do counseling. I have a decent gpa (3.3) and a lot of experience in the mental health field due to volunteering and internships. Also some research experience.

I have no doubt that I want to get my MSW, and I would like to go to a program that has a strong clinical focus. Preferably I would also like to do research and would not have a problem writing a thesis. (Originally wanted to do clinical psychology phD but my gpa killed that dream. I also like the that social work takes into account a social and environmental factors.)

If I could have any job in the world, I would be a clinical director eating disorder treatment center. I would also like to do a little research and maybe teach at some point (possibly get my phd in social work when I'm older). 

My issue with MSW programs is COST. I live in Massachusetts and there are a lot of great programs in the area. Unfortunately, the most of the prestigious ones like Boston College, Simmons, Smith, and Boston University, are very expensive. I have no intention of taking out huge loans since I have $25,000 from undergrad. So I've got to get a scholarship.

I've decided to apply to City Year Boston, where you tutor inner city kids. I really do enjoy working with kids and I really like the organization's mission. They also have amazing scholarships for the MSW programs at BC, Simmons, and BU. Not sure if I would definitely get one, but I think I am a pretty strong applicant. 

This is my only issue... I don't want to stay on the east coast for the rest of my life. Ideally I would like to move to southern California. (Can't take the cold winters here). If I go to a more ""prestigious"" school on the east coast... will it even matter when I move? I fear that all of my connections will be on the east coast, and I have no intention on staying here once I get my education. 

Basically, I would like to get a degree at a strong clinical program that will prepare for a job wherever I go. I would go to a state school in MA, but I want to get the best training possible, and from what I have read, they are not as highly regarded. Please correct me if I'm wrong. 

Sorry for the wall of text!!! Feel free to just answer the title question.

[I have a good friend who is a VP at your firm . They blamed the entire Financial crisis on ' poor people who could not afford their mortgages ' they said this was pretty much he opinion among the investment banks .  How do you feel about what happened to Greece and Goldmans hand in it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vfvp7?context=5)|That is not true. Opinion is very much split within the investment banks and there is no right or wrong answer. I personally don't believe at all that the crisis was caused by 'poor people' - and I don't like that sort of categorization of people in the first place. There are perhaps 15/20 different institutions you could blame for the crisis, there's no way of isolating individuals.  I'm not sure what exactly you think GS's hand in the Greece affair was. Of course it's a sad story and I feel remorseful - I recently donated £50,000 at a charity ball to help rebuild one of the islands which has almost been burned to the ground. But ultimately Greece employed GS at the time because they wanted to fudge their finances  so as to meet entry requirements for the Euro i.e. the greek government was knowingly employing GS to help perform an extremely risky task - GS didn't force anything upon them. If the experiment explodes 10 years later (as it did), should GS really be the party to blame?

[1\) How did you cope with the hours? I like working hard, I like working for my money but I also like enjoying free time and having a social life. When working a 100 hours as an analyst that would certainly have to suffer  2\)What were you academic results like through your degree?   I'm currently in my second year and will be realistically looking at 2.2, 2.2, 2.1 and 2.1 (years 1-4\). This summer I'd hope to get an accountancy internship in one of the big 4 followed by an internship next year in one of the large IBs. I know there's more to a candidate than solely their academic credentials + internship but would this stand me well for a BB in London? (Top Irish university, undergrad will be in Business and French\)  3\) What is it that makes you enjoy this job? I know the paycheck is certainly a bonus but you've said there's more to it than that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vfba8?context=5)|Whatever your breakdown between modules is, you need a 2.1 overall. Even if your average is 60% or 61%, that's enough to get you past the minimum requirements and through to interviews. After that it's up to you - they'll take someone with a good business mind and strong communications skills irrespective of whether they average 60 or 78 or 92.  I disagree with him. My job is extremely rewarding and i wouldn't swap it for any other industry at the moment. If you want evidence of people enjoying their jobs look at the number of years they spend at their respective firms. Most of the partners at GS are 'home-grown' and have spent 20/30 years sweating away but don't regret it for a second.

How do you reduce it? It won't happen unless the public demand it, as everyone with power tends to benefit from it and so they won't make meaningful steps to change anything, i.e. its a win win situation for government and business.

The chinese walked away and so the share price plunged and despite serious operational issues, the massive drop has presented a golden buying opportunity.
 |Long term- anything to avoid inflation, inflation scares the crap out of me and is going to be a big problem in the Uk and elsewhere in the future.
 |Also buy into soft commodity boom e.g. meat in africa, think zambeef etc if you can find an attractive entry point.

Depending on what area you are applying for, make sure you know some really good examples and stock pitches as it is amazing how many candidates lack knowledge e.g. if applying for ECM for god sakes know some of the recent IPO's  and likewise for equity research have good stock pitches and have conviction when presenting. Best of luck!

[What is the biggest reward of working in IB? Where I study, students with high grades are pushed to chase the prestigious internships firms like GS, MS, etc offer. Their reasoning why they chase these jobs is that they think it is the highest (prestige\) in finance they can go or are attracted by the money. It seems shallow to me.

Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vf7nq?context=5)|I'd say during my first 3 years as an analyst the 'balance' was almost non-existent i.e. i was regularly working 100+ hours/week. Since then it's become easier year by year and i think that's true for most. And yes certainly i would encourage my children to pursue it - not that i have any yet.

 |And by the way all of us are tax payers too. The top 5% contribute approx. 50% of the government's taxation revenue. So if losses are being 'carried by tax-payers' - that doesn't exclude people in the banking industry by any means.

Comm enough to compete with others when looking for jobs in the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vek3v?context=5)|Depends on what entry point - if you do an mba then you apply for associate entry whereas b.comm is an undergrad degree and so you apply for analyst roles. If you do a b.comm at a top university/college and get some internships then you should be well placed. Good luck!
[Do any of your co-workers frequent Reddit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vm4fp?context=5)|I imagine less than 0.1%.

[I used to work for the swiss banks and swiss stock market indirectly, and have a few friends in the banking business, including GS and Nakamura in London.

Also, also what is your stance on GS' questionable involvment in Backpage.com? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7voje3?context=5)|With regards to backpage.com, the guys on the deal did not do their KYC checks properly. KYC checks are crucial for banks- your reputation and future success is more important than any single customer. Look up riggs bank and the Obiang family and then you'll see!
[Possible. But realistically those kind of excuses are given no matter what really happened. For a company as big and powerful as GS I can only take it with a grain of salt.

Any chance you answer the other questions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vp76w?context=5)|Yes, apologies. I think some of our deals have been morally reprehensible in the past. The same goes for any major investment bank. But i think we've done a very good job in 'cleaning up our act' over the past few years and the public has played a large part in that. With any luck we will see a much healthier banking industry soon.

16fuet,1,2013-01-12,Phone call from potential employer was super confusing. ,throwawaythebelt,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16fuet/phone_call_from_potential_employer_was_super/,"OK, yesterday at about 5 after 5 I get a phone call unexpectedly for a job I applied for about 10 days ago. The first thing the woman did was gush about my experience and how great my resume was. Then she took time to  pick my brain about various things I had done.  It was a great boost to my ego as up to this point I have had no luck since my graduation on December 8th. My only interview was for an unpaid internship that maybe they want to make a job and pay me for it, but they are not sure yet. That one was a real let down as the whole conversation both people took pages of notes on my ideas, but there was no promise of paid employment at the end. 


Well after she was done with that line of thinking, she went over the job and stated that normally the position pays low 30’s but considering my experience, they were willing to go as high as 38/39. She then said she knew this was not enough considering my background and experience   and she wanted to make sure I was aware of the compensation before I came in. Then she asked me about my plans and where I saw myself. I told her that I would finish my MBA while working full-time and hopefully get to a point in my career where I can be comfortable enough in my finances to help my two kids with college. 


Now, right here it got a little awkward as she started telling me that they wanted to make me a happy employee and they wanted to make sure I would stay at least a little while as they were investing in me with their training and such. She made sure to tell me there were not a lot of title changes at the office and that it may be difficult to climb the ladder there. She said that she wished she could fast-forward two years as they have some need for an MBA for some kind of other position and that would be just the right salary for me. 


We then closed with her telling me to take time to think it over and call her on Monday to set a time to meet if it seems agreeable. She thanked me and told me how great I was again and we hung up. 
The whole conversation had an awkward vibe to it. It is weird when someone offers you a position but then says there is no real mobility to it and then goes on at length about how great a candidate you are. I just do not know how to take that. The money is less than I would want as I wanted at least 45, but I do not want to turn it down and lose my chance. 
Last evening I added her on LinkedIn and thanked her as well as letting her know I would call to set a meeting to further discuss salary and such next week. I figured maybe they could come up to 45k.


The thing is I just got an email from another position I had applied for and then a follow-up email with a login for a Predictive Index® survey. THEREFORE, they were interested enough in me to do that. The pay on that position is a bunch more. I still have quite a few applications out there and I do not want to jump on this offer and then be thrown something better. 
I would feel like a douche if I take this job and then something better comes a week or two after and then I burn my bridges with them by leaving. 




What should I do?


What is the take on that whole phone conversation? 



Is the other company interested in me if they went ahead and sent out a Predictive Index® survey login?

16ft51,16,2013-01-12,Can I safely let myself fall into debt in order to make it through school and graduate with a BSc in Mechanical Engineering?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16ft51/can_i_safely_let_myself_fall_into_debt_in_order/,"I am half way through my 2nd year of a 5 year program. I have maxed out my student loans every semester so far. In other words, I am in:

4 semesters x $7000 = $28000

worth of debt in the form of student loans. I have owned a credit card for many years now and have never missed a payment and never carried over any balance.

Here's my problem: Due to the program I am in, I have to work as an intern about once a year (for a 4 month period). Due to this, I'll likely have made too much money to be eligible for loans in my province. So I'll receive $0 in loans from now on. But considering the costs of living, I will not have made up the difference. 

So I'm thinking that the only way to make it through these next two and a half years is the following:

-Live from penny to penny  
-Try and use my available credit intelligently to its limits while making sure I make the minimum monthly payments

Or are there any other recommendations?

PS: I was just approved for a second credit card with a limit of $7500. I'd like to restate that I currently have absolutely no debt other than student loans, and I'm fairly certain that I have a decent credit score."

I feel really bad, like am I an asshole for telling her it's not going to work? She kept telling me that I shouldn't have been so mean about it because I told her it's not going to work instead of just letting it happen after I transfer.

That makes my goal of graduating this semester a little harder. I haven't taken any IS courses yet, except for IS 350.

So, my questions for you awesome peeps are:

1) Should I push myself and take seven classes this semester, or just take it easy and take five classes this semester, and get a full time job and take the rest after work next semester?

2) I've been looking for internships, but so far, haven't found any. Any tips on what I can do? Like I said, I haven't taken all the courses yet, but I know that one of my strongest skills is my ability to grasp and pick up knowledge fast. How can I use that to land an IS based internship?"

16fai1,3,2013-01-12,Finally got an accnt and my first post is to ask y'all for help. I got fired today...here's my story...,[deleted],misc,https://www.reddit.com/r/misc/comments/16fai1/finally_got_an_accnt_and_my_first_post_is_to_ask/,"I'm a lurker too. Been a redditor for a little over a year now and ironically, just last night I upgraded to a ""pro"" account on the iPhone app to support reddit and thought today I would join. 

Go figure that my first post is a, well, downer post. I got fired from my first job. I know it sounds like an ever-day Joe Shmoe woe, but this one was particularly tough, I wanted to share it and get your guys’ help. If you don’t want to read the story, skip to the end – I totally understand, heh.

So here is my story and here is why I wanted to post it on Reddit.

My name is Justine. I'm 24 and I graduated in 2011 from Ringling College of Art and Design as part of their first digital filmmaking class. I don’t know if y’all know of Ringling, but it isn't cheap. I was frankly surprised my parents allowed me to go there, knowing I'd come out with over 70k in loans, but they had tremendous faith in me and my talent/passion for filmmaking. The four years I spent there were tough - I was new to film (having never touched a record button in my life) but I made it through. Bumps and bruises to be had, but I survived. But I managed and even snagged a few awards along the way.

Here was the hard part though. We were the first graduating class and that meant we were pretty much on our own – no alumni of the major, no real connections, nothing. So I had to get really creative and no small amount ambitious. The looming graduation brought to light two options that I had: either go back to suburban Pennsylvania and live with my folks, or find a way to get to Los Angeles and pursue my (yes it sounds cheesy) dream. Of COURSE I was doing the latter.

Another problem (as it is with a lot of recent grads) - I had no money. I knew that, my parents knew that, my friends even my teachers knew that. So after talking with some people I came up with the idea of posting an ad on Craigslist with the title ""will trade work for room and board"" - I thank my lucky stars for ""the Sams"" as I call them. A family of two (widower and his daughter) living in northern Los Angeles took me in and said I could stay with them until I found work in exchange for light cooking, cleaning and nanny-ing.

As many if not all of you know, job hunting isn't easy...especially in the entertainment industry. I got a part-time job at a retail store and took up working as a PA on more student films, did some free jobs and got one or two paying jobs. Despite that, it's hard being at home all the time - your head gets to you (mine in particular is ruthless). I fought really hard to get to LA but even that didn't prevent me for wanting to give up. My student loans had gone in to effect and my parents were paying them, but I knew that wasn't going to last long as they are close to retirement. If I didn't have a full time job by the summer (one year from when I moved out there) I was to go home and pretty much work as a waitress because I would be cornered by the loans/debt. Needless to say those were some of the darkest days of my life. The lack of being productive and independent made me feel like a failure. I got in to shit that was not good, drama that was way outta the realm of a reality TV show among other things. I'll spare you all the details.

I kept going, and finally got an internship in Feb 2012 (yes AFTER school). The internship was only $8 an hour but it was a hell of a lot better than nothing!! 

Three months of that and then I got my big break, or at least what I thought was my big break. A dear friend of mine suggested me for a position she was temping in at BIG Cable Network (i.e. premium channels) as an executive’s assistant. After lots of phone calls and an interview or two, I was hired. This was unusual because one, I didn’t have any agency experience and two, I was very nearly fresh out of college. But I had a bang-up resume and some wonderful references. It was a job I felt I was made for.

Little did I know, haha.

I don't now if many of you have ever worked for an executive in the film/entertainment industry but let me tell you. It's hard. Check out this website: http://hollywoodassistants.tumblr.com/ or watch ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Granted, my story as an executive assistant wasn't AS bad as Anne Hathaway's but my fear and paranoia was EXACTLY the same.

I worked my ass off, making a few mistakes, but I was just out of college and this was my first job. Everyone told me my boss knew that and mistakes happen so I should just keep working hard.

I would ask for feedback, talk to his previous assistant for advice, talk to OTHER assistants, I asked HR to find a class I could take on being the best assistant, I even tried to train myself on the particular department I worked for (as it wasn’t my forte). Shit hit the fan a few times (but nothing that was major, or so I had been told…this was my first job, so I needed other people’s insight), but I did everything in my power to fix it. I thought things had been going smoothly....he really hadn't indicated they weren't. And like I said, I was paranoid as shit so I double and triple checked things.

Then today, two days after he got back from a HUGE conference in Vegas that I organized down to a ""T""...he calls me in and there is HR.

Boom. Fired.

Dunno how I didn't fall to pieces in that meeting today, but I didn't. I calmly packed my things with the help of a coworker, sent a goodbye email and made it to the elevator where ALL my friends/coworkers had gathered to wait for me. The faucets turned on and I bawled.

I need your help. If you guys know of anything in Los Angeles, openings, websites, even advice ...please email respond or email me at sigyn.astira@gmail.com (or if any of y’all are interested, I have a website you can check out, just ask). I have one month's rent left before I'm looking at having to head back to PA.

And I really don't want to do that. So please…anything helps :-/

After only six years. And now I feel like I'm going to lose the life I've worked so hard for to it and the thought is completely devastating. 

The first time forced me to spend all of high school at home and in and out of hospital rooms. It cost me a volleyball scholarship. A golf scholarship. Most of my friends. Now, in my FINAL semester of college (which I struggled to do in three years to stay ""on-track"")... three days before I was expected to return to classes, to my clubs, to the stellar internship I worked my ass of for, to my roommates, to my boyfriend... it's back. And nobody knows what it is or if the treatment plan we're taking is even going to work.

A content marketing/copywriting internship.

**About me**  
I am a 22 year old University graduate keen to work in a creative marketing based role. I recently completed a BA in Media at the University of New South Wales where I focussed on Marketing and Advertising. I also learnt how to make effective presentations in front of large audiences and refined my writing ability with the assistance of peer and teacher evaluations.

In my last year of studies, a few close friends and I formed the European Society of which I became Vice President. In this role, I managed the social media presence, wrote the copy for flyers, designed the logo, assisted in brainstorming and organising attention and fund raising events, and actively recruited members. Within two months, we were able to gain 120 loyal new members and were featured in the University magazine. At the time of my graduation, the society had over 400 loyal members. 

In addition, I supplemented my studies by attaining over four years of experience in sales, ranging from cold-calling to pitching and face-to-face interactions. This experience consistently helps me determine how to create and maintain attention and interest, and allows me to compose content that reflects this. 

Upon my relocation to London at the start of 2012, I worked for 10 months in an admin-based role in a small office environment. In this position, I wrote and sent out promotional material, developed and strengthened relationships with suppliers, successfully negotiated for lower prices and better service, effectively managed my diary and organised my time to ensure all deadlines were met. 

In looking for an internship, I am eager for an opportunity to utilise these skills and abilities to help write fantastic content for your business and approach any challenge and task you throw at me. I will also be happy to assist with administrative duties, and help your team with anything else you require. I am also fluent in Russian . 

**Goals**  
 My primary goals for this internship are to learn, network and grow my brand.

**Contact**  
Please PM me for more details and my portfolio. 

Thanks.

I'm also a telecommunications major and like to write. Now that I'm starting to look for summer opportunities, no one thing seems to jump out at me-- that is, there aren't any companies or positions that immediately seem like a good fit for what I can do/have done.

I am in my 3rd year of study, out of 5 (as the school has a 3 co-op cycle, meaning I am in school for Fall/Winter quarters, and then have a 6 month job internship, paid).  I'm also a white female, born in the US, so I don't have a huge advantage in terms of acceptance to medical school.

Over the past year I've been trying to figure out what I want to do after college. With what I have read, and the professors and students I have talked to, I realize the job possibilities post-undergraduate with no additional degree in Biomed are very few.  Most go on to graduate school, law school or in the vast majority of cases, medical school. Most of my classmates are in BME to up their chances of medical school acceptance, with the intentions of being a doctor of varying sorts.  Besides the fact that I need to take the MCAT, I know nothing about the process of applying.

I am extremely fortunate in that my parents will (to an extent) help me with some fees, but I expect to be taking out some loans in the case that I am accepted to medical school.  Right now I am more concerned with the ""getting in"" aspect.  

I am concentrating in neuroengineering, and I am intending a minor in psychology. Psych has always been of the utmost interest to me, since my family has a prevalence of mild-medium degrees of mental illness.  At the urging of my parents (both businesspeople), I went into engineering to achieve a ""technical base.""  It is not my intention to get a masters in any engineering field, because I feel my talents are exceedingly in the favor of another venue: psychiatry.

tldr; I want to become a psychiatrist, which I understand entails medical school, and I have absolutely no idea where to start with any of it.

No one in my family has ever gotten a degree above an undergraduate, and I do not closely know anyone who has gone to medical school, let alone someone in my intended field.  I have a meeting set up with an advisor at my school, for the end of January, but I'd prefer to walk in knowing at least SOMETHING so I don't sound like a blubbering idiot.

***So, my question is this***: What should I be doing RIGHT NOW to start preparing?  What should I do first?  What classes should I take that look best on applications?  When and how to I apply?  Who should I be trying to contact?  What should I be expecting, in terms of applying to medical school, first classes, and the length and demand during clinical and residency?  Are there any tips or tricks for any aspect of this whole process I should know? "

She was the reason why I was able to receive Pell Grants to go to school, as well. Now I can no longer get those grants. Dad is unable to pay. As Bursar charges have prevented me from enrolling in future classes, I'm left with the question of what to do next.

At 23, does it make sense to get a job, save up, and finish the remaining (~two) years I have left? Or would it make better practical sense to go ahead and try to pursue a career, despite not having finished? Further, is it possible to get a job that could benefit me later professionally while paying off school in the short-term? My degree focused on political/geopolitical affairs.

I was an active campus leader elected to run some of the largest organizations at my university (at a larger state school), and I also had many national opportunities to network (where various organizations would pay for my travel to many activist-related political/geopolitical events). I've also had 11 internships since the age of 16; ranging from every level of government (local to federal) as well as private-sector.
 
So what do you think: stay and work it off, or go out and try to join the workforce? That would probably entail me moving from the South to Washington, DC.

[possibly NSFW],ConfusedGemini,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/16imu2/im_a_straight_female_who_fell_in_love_with_a_girl/,"I am a 21 year old student who spent the summer in Europe doing an internship. I have a wonderful boyfriend who knows me, everything about me and who I am, and with whom I can not imagine being without. We have been dating for over three years now. We laugh together a lot, and the sex is fantastic.

When I went abroad, we agreed to do it long-distance for the 3 months and to see how we were doing when I got back. I knew that I didn't want to cheat and that breaking down this kind of relationship for some summer fling would be stupid, so I resolved to remain apart from relationships in general while abroad. This was not difficult for the most part...I didn't actually meet any guys that I would have wanted more than my boyfriend.

However, one of my female coworkers and I quickly became great friends. I often went out drinking with her and would crash at her place, and we had so much in common. I loved hanging out with her. One night, while drunk after stumbling home, I thought I was getting vibes from her...I realized that in theory, I did find her sexually attractive. Me, someone who had always thought I was completely straight! I later found out that she was a lesbian, if not bisexual with a preference for women. This didn't change anything, and I remained good friends with her.

At one point, she got drunk and confessed to me that, if I did not have a boyfriend, and if I did live near her, she would pursue a relationship with me. She said she felt a connection, and I was stunned to answer that IF we were living in the same country, and IF I didn't have a wonderful relationship with a man for 3 years, I would say yes. I knew in that moment that I was telling the truth. We acknowledged that it was silly, and that starting a relationship in this sense wouldn't be fair to either of us. We didn't want a quick fling, we actually felt affection for one another. We told each other it would remain friendly affection only, and that's how it was the rest of the time I was there. I was very sad to say goodbye to her at the end of the summer.

When I returned, I realized how much I had missed my boyfriend. We started back up again as if I had never left, and we are still very much in love. However, I still think of my friend from abroad. We keep in touch through email, and I look forward to hearing from her.

This is what confuses me: is it possible to love two people at the same time? I feel like part of myself is the part loving her, and I would never admit this to anyone. Another part of myself, the large majority part, is still madly in love with my boyfriend of 3.5 years. I would never, EVER cheat on my boyfriend. 

I still feel guilty though, is this emotional cheating? I'm not sure what the right way to go about this is. So far, I just don't tell anyone. At all. I keep it to myself, but that's why I had to post it here. It just feels good to get it out there, even if no one reads this!"

Aubrey Plaza plays an intern at a magazine who has to investigate a classified ad from a guy(Mark Duplass) looking for a partner for time travel. 

Accompanying her on her trip to investigate are another intern and a journalist from the magazine, who attempts to rekindle his own teenage romance while attempting to get the other (nerdy) intern have some fun in life.

The film has charm and the performances from all the actors are good. The story is weak though, and as I've said before ""comedy-dramas"" are almost always just forgettable.

Decent film, but never going to be on anyone's favourites list or must-watch list.

Real talk:
Myfitnesspal made me realize just how much beer I've been drinking.  It's difficult to get away from alcohol but I realize I've been using it as a social crutch, and not treating it as what it should be: a treat.  I have to face up to the fact that I've been using beer and food as a substitute for real positivity and dynamism in my life.

I've always tossed and turned at night. My dad was always yelling at my sister and I, and my mom. He was that way until I entered high school. I wrote my first suicidal note during class in 2nd grade, I was lonely and didn't know how to interact with other children. I did have a friend on my street, she was very manipulative. The coach of my PE class hated me. He always thought I was cheating and lying because I couldn't look him in the eyes and because I was always off to the side being nervous. He'd make me sit out sometimes, and I wouldnt even know what I did wrong. He loved my sis. He told my sis ""You're nothing like your sister.""


When we moved from TX to PA, things just got worse. I started 4th grade there. I was bullied for being chubby and for being different, because I said ya'll. I'd get pushed a lot, and kicked, and one time got beaten up at the bus stop. I had a friend that wouldn't even acknowledge my existence in school... and even be a part of the bullying, but she'd be nice to me once we got off the bus to go home. I had another friend. I remember walking with her hand in hand down the hall and everybody started calling us lesbians right there and started laughing at us. I had to ask what it was because I didnt even know what a lesbian was. The bullying kinda tore our friendship apart. I just decided to be alone.


This girl would bully me and then say ""Geez, why are you always crying?"" I remember the day I got fed up for being bullied because I was chubby, and threw my uneaten lunch away. I descended into anorexia. Some kids caught on and told the nurse. The nurse told the teacher and my teacher said that if I didn't eat, he'd take my recess away, but it didnt make any difference to me, I had nobody to play with. Id usually just sit on top of the highest place in the jungle gym and watch everybody else live their lives, lives that I was not allowed to be a part of. Alone.

**Middle School**

Still lonely, but I had a good friend at lunch. Was never able to hang out with her after school because her mom was strict about visitors and didn't let her outside the house. I didn't have much energy, and depression made it hard to concentrate. Teachers would stop in the middle of their lecture and pull me out of class to scold me outside for not paying attention.  I wouldnt want to go to school, sometimes Id drink a bunch of salt water and make myself throw up so that I could feign illness and stay home.

When we moved to FL, I had one teacher scream at me in front of the entire class because my folder wasn't organized the way he wanted it to be. (They were all looking at me, remembering how embarassing it was, I've started crying while writing this. I've always tried to not draw any attention to myself, yet theres been so many instances where the whole class had their eyes on me, like ""Why are you here? You aren't like us."") This was the same teacher that didn't let me go to the nurse when my fingers were sprained and got mad at me because I hadnt written much by the end of class.


Things were slightly better in FL. I still had bullies, but I had some friends. I met my (now) husband when I was 13, we met online. With my poor self esteem, I could've ended up with an asshole. That's not him. He's a wonderful person and he's helped me a lot... He's very sweet and understanding, the best kind of influence. 

**High School**

It seems like every time a teacher scolded me, even if it was something really minor, I'd start crying. I don't know why. And everybody would be looking at me again. I still cry really easily when someone is scolding or criticizing me and I can't stop it. But I've always been hard on myself too. I had a solo in high school chorus. The first time I performed it in front of people, I went back to the dressing room and started sobbing. ""That was terrible, I hate myself."" 


I got a concussion one day, it took 2 weeks to get better, and when we got an MRI, they discovered that I had arachnoid cysts on my brain. Many times they wont have symptoms, but I have a really big one in the front. It may contribute to my depression.

High school was not so bad... only that the damage done during the previous grades was still there. I was really paranoid and on the edge. Really shy and awkward. I felt like every whisper was about me, and some of them were, but... not to the extent that I felt. Still stayed up late, tossing and turning, afraid about tomorrow.

**College**

I finally got over my anorexia towards the end of high school, and at the beginning of community college, I was starting to feel pretty good. I was still pretty awkward, but still


Things kinda went downhill when I entered university and got my first ""job."" I majored in Web Design. I was working with my mom at the UPS store and this guy comes in and says he needs help with his website. I was so naive, I really wish I had said no...


My fiance had started fire academy back where he lived. With this ""job"" I thought, ""wow this is a great opportunity for me to do my part too and start getting experience in my field."" Not so. 


I slowly started to realize something was fishy. ""Something isn't right, or am I going crazy?"" First he told me he'd pay me. Then he said he'd get me school credit instead of paying me, he told me an internship was required for my degree and then I found out that it wasn't. Then he said he'd pay me again. He'd play mind games.  He'd make you feel like crap. He'd lie. He'd make you feel like everything was your fault.


My facebook was set on private and I only add people I know. I never added him. I swear he could somehow see my posts though. It was like... a couple times, he brought up something up that I said the night before on FB. I had started complaining about this whole thing on facebook because I wanted advice. This is hard to explain correctly, but he'd even use  some of the same wording as I did, using emphasis one a specific part that pissed him off, but at the same time, be so vague about it that you aren't quite sure that you know that he knows... it makes you feel like you're going crazy. I didnt get on facebook on a company computer, my computer scan didnt pick up any spyware, my facebook was private. ""How could you possibly know that?"" I didnt feel safe inside my own head, you know?


He always seemed like he was about to boil over and go off on us at any second. He felt dangerous, I was afraid... I thought he could kill me at any time. I wanted to believe that what I was doing was a good thing though...


 I saw him lie to someone about his name and then he made some excuse to me that, at the time, I believed. Pay time came around, and he kept making excuses and putting it off. ""I'll have it tomorrow"" I asked the other woman there if she'd gotten paid, she said no. We swapped numbers. When he heard us doing this, he flipped out. He called me and told me not to believe anything she says because she was bipolar and unstable.


It turns out my so-called ""boss"" was a scam artist. He hops from city to city, running from the police, changing his name. Before I quit I discovered that someone even made a blog dedicated to all the people he scammed. For a while he was using the website that ""I"" helped make to scam other people. I felt like I couldn't live with myself. I was afraid to quit because he was so violent. After my summer class was over, Id sit in the empty art building alone, sobbing and hyperventilating. I couldn't talk to my fiance about this because I could never get in touch with him while he was in fire academy. He was going through his own hell at the time.


I finally got the courage and made up some excuse like ""working full time and going to college full time was too stressful and I keep having panic attacks. Im going to go start seeing somebody about my stress.""


I called the other lady that  worked for him that was suspicious about him too and she said she was going to stay and that theyd worked out some agreement. I told her what I knew about him and told her to get out of there. I asked her to not tell him that I gave her this info. She tried to fight for both of us, and it was a kind gesture, but she wound up dragging me into it. I just wanted to cut my losses and  walk away from it. They'd both be calling me with their arguments about each other. 


I was shaking violently out of fear when I called her and told her that she didnt have to stand up for me, that I appreciated what she was doing, but I just wanted it to end. But now he wouldnt stop calling me, and it lasted for months. As quiet and submissive I am, even I got tired of it and yelled at him. He finally stopped calling after that. I had to change my ringtone, because every time it went off it made me remember everything and gave me panic attacks. This is kinda funny looking back at it, but I had been playing pokemon on my DS, and and NPC called me in game and had the same name as him, I wound up flinging my DS because I had this overwhelming and irrational feeling of dread that he was trying to contact me again. 


I had a few short jobs/internships after that. For the rest of my college career I was pushing through burn out, depression, stress, paranoia. I started skipping many of my classes and doing all my work at home. I also always felt like group partners were trying to take advantage of me.. and there is a ring of truth to that because I had a lot of lazy partners, but perhaps I should not have viewed them as harshly I did my ""boss."" 

I was lonely without my fiance, we spend 9 years apart while visiting maybe once or twice a year. Towards the end of college, I was contemplating suicide daily... and had to do everything in my power to stop myself. I remember sitting in the bathroom with the door locked with a razor blade in hand. ""Do it. Do it!"" Id sit there for a long time trying to convince myself not to.

**Now**
After graduating, I got married to the love of my life and moved in with him, but it's been months and I can't find a job. I feel so worthless. I feel like I don't belong in this world, like I can't fit in anywhere. I've sent out a lot of e-mail applications for jobs in the area and remote jobs. I try to write my e-mails as professionally as I can, and I keep improving my design and programming skills while I'm waiting for a reply from SOMEBODY. Even if someone were to get back to me, suppose they want an interview? I still stutter and shake and mumble, not to mention I look like a 16 year old... nobody is ever going to take me seriously. Even when I was booking hotel rooms for our honeymoon, they were all ""What are you like 12?"" I'm twenty three, TWENTY THREEEEEEE! 

My husband gets upset because I seem unhappy sometimes, its only because I feel like I can't pull my own weight no matter how hard I try to. He makes me very happy, but I worry about my ability to make him feel happy and fulfilled, and he in turn... sees this and becomes upset because Im unhappy, and then Im all ""Oh no ;__; hes not happy with me."" I know its stupid...

But there are plenty in nonprofits! So I'm mostly going to be applying to those, especially social-justice-y ones like the ACLU.

I was discussing this with my mother and she started mocking, telling me that I'll be poor and do I want to be poor and how am I going to live the life that I'm used to? She pointed out my glasses (they're currently taped together, I haven't had time to get a new pair yet) and said that that's how I'll live for the rest of my life if I don't get an internship at a for-profit place.

My family is very affluent but I don't think that I live an extravagant life (outside of my college tuition). I understand that having no money all the time sucks, but I'd honestly rather do that than move back in after college, or work in a sterile corporate environment that makes me hate myself.

Blegh. This is part rant and part advice request I guess. All I want is a job that lets me take a day off once in a while and that doesn't make me conform to beauty standards (wear lots of makeup, shave my legs, straighten my hair, wear skirts/heels). Can it be that hard to have a job like that and put food on the table?"
16hxld,0,2013-01-13,Looking to reboot my career with seemingly no resources to so. Where should I start?,honkerburger,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16hxld/looking_to_reboot_my_career_with_seemingly_no/,"I graduated from a tiny liberal arts school in 2008 with an impractical degree in sociology. Since then, I have encountered varying levels of struggle and frustration in figuring out a way to keep my head above water without selling myself out. Here's a little back story, and if you want to skip it, just go past this next paragraph:

The journey began with me spending about 9 months working at a cafe where I met some great people and got to coast for a bit on the ""just figuring things out"" phase. I was financially solvent and had a low overhead. When student loan payments started coming in, I was seeing myself barely breaking even. A friend recruited me to work at a hip restaurant he was opening up through promises of a decent wage and generous flow of tips. Long story short, I learned not to work for friends and quit that job with some new baggage - credit card debt. After that stint, I got my first desk job as an Administrative Specialist/Executive Assistant at the state's biggest medical college. It was a nice change of pace at first, but I eventually became amazingly depressed from the muted atmosphere and the meek, bored/boring people I worked with. I felt I wasn't growing as a person and felt disconnected from my goals of helping people and exploring my skill set. I pulled a 180 and opted to do an AmeriCorps stint with Habitat for Humanity. I loved working with my hands and really enjoyed my cooworkers' company. They were much more my type of people. Our affiliate kind of sucked, and living on government stipend was extremely difficult ($900/month), but it was refreshing for the most part. After that year, I briefly took up a green building internship, which at the time looked like an in to a possibly career path but I ultimately didn't enjoy the work they had me doing or the people I was working around. I left the internship for another government stipend funded job with a homeless shelter that is recognized in the entire region for its rehabilitative services. For a year I worked on capacity-building and creating housing and community resources for our homeless residents. There were things I liked about the job, but I saw a lot of corruption that I hoped to avoid by working in the nonprofit sector and ended up almost counting down the hours until my one year contract expired. I decided to give non profit one more chance and got hired last September as a case manager with a local branch of a national nonprofit which I won't name. At this point, I'm pretty sure that this nonprofit game is not for me and I am finding myself burnt out and routinely frustrated by the pressures of what nonprofit work entails - namely compromising quality and care to meet the needs of wealthy funders who simply want to see quantity.

I now believe I have a career path that I want to explore, but am facing some challenges in even knowing where to begin. I have been looking into becoming a physical therapist, possibly by way of becoming a physical therapist assistant first. For someone with savings or a safety net, this would probably mean going back to school full-time and maybe holding down a part-time job to pay the rent. Here are the problems I'm currently facing that have made going back to school difficult:

* $15,000 left in student loans from my undergraduate
* $6,500 in credit card debt accumulated over four years
* A current salary that has firmly established my in paycheck-to paycheck territory (I am not a generally irresponsible spender)
* My car's about to die
* Continuing my education would require a relocation that would be another expense problem and possible logistical problem.

I want to help people and I want the chance to make a comfortable living. I see a pathway to achieve that equilibrium, but I don't have the resources for that path. I would love some good advice on where to start on making this idea a reality.

Any advice would be so appreciated.

Posted to r/Jobs with no success ,[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/16hwd6/relocation_advice_posted_to_rjobs_with_no_success/,"I've just finished up school and have an internship under my belt and now I've started applying to a bunch of jobs. I'd like to move out west and establish a career out there, I'm just looking for some advice or general guidelines on how this whole relocation thing works.

I have two phone interviews set up for next week at smaller companies, one in California and one out in Colorado. I'm 99% sure relocation assistance is out of the question but I'm not sure how to proceed. Both people doing the hiring know I'm looking to relocate as I've put it on my résumé and they mentioned it in a follow up email.

Anyway, during the phone interview I assume they will ask me when I'm available to start, I don't know exactly how to answer that. I would figure about one month so I can put in a notice at my current job and some time to pack up and leave, but I don't want to get rejected for taking too long. Also, would you suggest if/when I secure the job to take a trip out there before actually moving to find a place to live? Or if someone has gone through this situation any tips would be greatly appreciated.

16hnmd,1,2013-01-13,How do you guys handle all the bitchy girls at bars/clubs? *rant*,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/16hnmd/how_do_you_guys_handle_all_the_bitchy_girls_at/,"What really turns me off to nightgame is how uptight and bitchy 90% of the girls are (especially as the night progresses). Even the ugly ones carry themselves as if they're fucking royalty. Even when they're actually receptive after you open them, they're usually really boring to talk to and make absolutely no effort to enliven the conversation (eg. I'll make a ridiculous sarcastic joke, she'll laugh, pause for 5 seconds, then give me some serious super-boring response or wait for me to say something else).

I know this sounds cocky, but I know that I'm a decently attractive guy and have pretty high standards when it comes to both looks AND personality (I like fun girls who don't take themselves too seriously). When girls are boring to talk to or make no effort to enhance the conversation, it's a turn-off to me and I don't feel compelled to keep making the effort to converse with them so I naturally stop talking (at which point they'll usually leave). Girls act completely different at bars/clubs than, say, a house party or a day-time social event. It's as if they expect you to do all the talking, provide all the entertainment, initiate everything, etc. 

How do you guys do it? When a girl doesn't really seem that into it do you keep at it or just eject from the set? It seems that in order to be successful, you have to be very aggressive and keep at it. The problem is, personally that goes completely against my style. The way I have it internalized in my brain is that if she's not even willing to make a certain minimal amount of effort to make this work, then she obviously doesn't want it enough and it's her loss. (I don't view myself as some sort of amazing prize or anything, but I definitely don't put a random cute girl on a pedestal.)

**the rest of this post is just ranting from tonight so you can stop reading here**

---

I'm seriously considering abandoning nightgame altogether. I hate to sound misogynist, but it's almost unreal how practically every girl gradually morphs into a cunt as the night progresses. Some examples from just tonight (sorry I feel like ranting):

* As I'm leaving the bathroom I see a girl fixing her hair and whatnot in front of a mirror. I say ""you look nice"" as I'm walking by. She gives me this death stare as if I just tried to date-rape her. In hindsight I wish I had said ""too bad you're a bitch"" but I'm too nice of a guy to say that...
* Countless times I'd approach a girl and she'd respond ""I don't know you"" (with a ""fuck-off"" expression on her face). O RLY? No fucking shit. This kind of response pisses me off. If you're so anti-social and/or uninterested in meeting strangers, then don't go out to a crowded bar/club. Actually, I don't even have a problem with you coming here, but how hard is it to give a polite rejection like ""sorry not interested""? Fuck's sakes.
* I had one of the most unpleasant conversations of my life tonight. Basically she was one of the most insecure losers I've ever met in my life and has absolutely no ability to detect sarcasm. To summarize, she just started working in IT consulting at Ernst &amp; Young and I'm a student applying for summer internships who's still figuring out what to do with my life. I was asking her questions related to her job to see whether or not it might be a good fit for me. When she said they had to travel a lot and I said that I'd only be willing to travel to cool cities and not the middle of nowhere, she legitimately got pissed and angrily said ""noooo you can't be that picky"" (as though I was a god-damn employee. wtf?). I tell her that I'm not set on consulting and could work in X industry and still get to stay in the city. She's like ""fine do that"" in a bitchy tone. Then I sarcastically say ""so basically, fuck consulting"" (keep in mind I'm smiling the whole time while she's legit getting pissed). Next thing you know, she's pathetically attempting to impress me with her job (all with a dead serious expression on her face). She even tells me that she's making $90k/year. At this point I'm just thinking ""wow this girl is so fucking insecure, she must hate her life"". I ask her (still smiling) ""are you trying to impress me?"" She gets pissed, says ""whatever, I don't even care what you think"", and walks off. 

I don't think I'll be applying for IT consulting at Ernst &amp; Young if a retarded life-sucking blonde like her can get a job there.

* On my walk home, the streets are empty except me and some Asian girl who's right behind me. At first I'm thinking ""whatever, it's 5am, she's not that hot, I don't want to scare her"". But then I'm like fuck it I'll be social/friendly, turn around, and say ""Good night?"" She's like ""meh"" without making eye contact so I turn back around and tell her my night was the same without looking at her. Then I stop at my apartment building and she happens to be in the exact same building (my building is small so this is rare). We're both kind of like ""woa"" and I ask ""are you a student here too?"" as I'm fumbling for me keys. She ignores me, unlocks the front door, and walks ahead of me. We both walk to our apartments and neither of us say ""bye"" or anything else.

Anyways I guess my point is, girls are cunts on Friday/Saturday nights. I understand that they get hit on all the time at bars/clubs, but this inflates their egos to the points where it's ridiculous and makes me want to turn gay. Seriously questioning the whole concept of nightgame. Doesn't even seem worth it unless you're shooting the shit with your buddies. /rant"

Ask me anything.,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16hht9/iama_female_sound_engineer_who_interned_at_a/,"Hi folks! I am a recent audio engineering graduate who has just completed a 3-month intensive internship in a world-renowned recording facility located in New York.  

I decided to put my internship experience up for an AMA for several reasons: 

*  There's not much firsthand information out there about internships in large-scale recording studios. But I should warn you, it's not as glamorous as it sounds.
* Since it's mostly a male-dominated profession, it's rarer to get a female perspective on it
* All in all, it was a unique, intense and truly rewarding experience. In a nutshell, my work ranged from doing daily microphone &amp; outboard gear inventories to scrubbing toilets and brewing fresh pots of coffee. With a couple of odd, bizarre tasks here and there.

So ask away! For the sake of anonymity, though, I can't divulge which studio I worked in, but I'll see what I can do to provide proof that I am in fact who I say I am :)

Update: **[PROOF](http://i.imgur.com/M6Faf.jpg?2)** = photo of the studio's microphone locker (well, part of it). One U87 microphone costs 4000-5000 USD. The studio I worked in has more than 10 of those mics, and many other more expensive selections."

I currently live in PA, USA and I recently applied for an internship at the School for Peace, Neve Shalom/ Wahat al Salam in Israel. Neve Shalom/ Wahat al Salam is a cooperative community jointly founded by Israeli Jews and Israeli Palestinian Arabs to show that they can live peacefully together.

It is an unpaid internship, but I'm mainly going for the experience.  I feel as if this opportunity will allow me to get my foot in the door for the field of conflict resolution research / nonprofit organizations. 

To tell you a little bit about myself, I'm a 23 year old male Korean-American, recently graduated with a B.A. in psychology with minors in political science and peace &amp; conflict studies.  I'm a HIP (Help Increase the Peace by [American Friends Service Committee](http://afsc.org/)) trainer and I hope to bring what I've learned through schooling and experience to this internship.  I also have some ideas in education and dialog I hope to develop but I understand I have a lot to learn before I can actualize my ideas.  In the future I hope to be in grad school and then eventually go for my doctorate but for now, working for nothing and learning whatever I can from wherever I can is my goal.

Anyway, I got an email from the communications and development coordinator asking me to begin looking for funding sources for my housing (I guess I'm being seriously considered).  It would come out to about 3,000 USD for my 6 month stay. So today, I come to you reddit, to ask you for your advice.  I've helped with project planning and fundraising for rotaract (rotary) in the past to expand a cramped school in Monrovia, Liberia but I've never had to look/ask for funding for myself from organizations.  Any advice or leads on where to start or how to go about doing this would help immensely.  I wasn't even aware organizations had programs to fund individuals like this, I always assumed it was more of a scholarship thing for school.  This is new ground for me and could use a little hand holding.

TL;DR: Need advice and help finding sources for funding in order to be housed in Israel for my (potential) unpaid internship.

I'm a senior analyst and I mainly lead efficiency projects and I've been doing very well there. 

I'd like to think I'm a good fit for consulting, but do yoy think my background is enough to apply for analyst consulting jobs? Or should I wait and distance myself from my bad gpa for a few more years before applying? 

Also, I haven't found anyone in my immediate circles who works in consulting. Is it best to apply blindly through their websites (I imagine no) or should I try to blind approach consultants through linkedin and try to apply through someone? Any other tips? 

And finally, I speak four languages and would love to do something international. Would international jobs be ridiculously more difficult to get?

I spent $329 on books that would have cost $560 at the bookstore. **However**, there are some books that need an online code to use on an online system, or you can't find on Amazon/online. I would suggest buying them *used* at the bookstore, or renting them. I've rented a few books and it has saved me about twenty bucks per book. Better yet, find people who have had the classes before and buy it off them. **A few people have also suggested using half.com and booksprice.com and bigwords.com. www.gettextbooks.com finds the cheapest textbook!**

**Go to every single class.** If you're sick, obviously skip, but going to class is nice. Not only does it make homework and tests easier to take (since you're there in class for lectures and assignments), but you get to build professional relationships with the professors and friendships with your fellow classmates. Also, you're PAYING FOR THEM.

**Most universities and colleges have tutoring places for free. Use them.**

**If you ~~don't like your roommate~~ need mediation between you and your roommate, be sure to go to your RA about it and have a meeting.** Instead of being an ass and saying straight up ""I hate you!"", make it less awkward and have a meeting. **However, if you have an actual issue with them, like them not cleaning their space or just being rude, talk to them about it first gently.** **EDIT: aishtr1295: ""Er, as someone who used to be an RA, don't come to us if you don't like your roommate. We can't do much about it unless shit hits the fan. But lets say you wanted someone to impartially and efficiently mediate a discussion between you two, then come to us. Talking, we can do. Anything else, not really.""

**Get to know your roommate's schedule.** Then, you can know when you're alone, when you need to wake up for class, etc.

**Be careful with your schedule.** Be sure to know where your classes are and when they are.

**Take advantage of the general education classes.** You need them to graduate. Sure, you might want to go into *x* major, and you're going to need that class *eventually*, but if another unrelated class sounds interesting (and it's considered a gen-ed), take it!

If anyone has any more ideas, include them in comments and I'll add them!

**EDITS:**

**The library is excellent for studying. Utilize it.** Also, the lounges in your dorm hallway are usually empty and they're good to study in. I'm not sure what your university or college has, but my student center and library have a bunch of study rooms specifically for studying. **Sometimes college libraries have textbooks that you can read and take home for a while! Check if your college has this!**

**Your relationships will change.** Not speaking from experience, but I know a few friends who have broken up with their SOs because of college. *NOT SAYING THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WON'T LAST.* Even my friendships have changed. There are some people who I don't talk to every day and now I don't have as strong as a friendship with them. For some, distance makes the heart grow fonder.

**That being said, my family relationships have changed for the better.** I was with them every single day for hours at a time. Now that I'm away I feel closer to them.

**Don't be afraid to be yourself.** Now that I'm out of high school, I feel that I can be more of myself than I was in high school. Partially because I don't see the same people every single day...

**Don't skimp on sleep.** Sleep is more important than homework. Plus, it's [proven that it's better to sleep than stay up late cramming.](http://healthland.time.com/2012/08/21/study-or-sleep-for-better-grades-students-should-go-to-bed-early/)

**Plagiarism is BAD. Don't do it!** Like SenseiKrystal pointed out, it may save time now, but it won't help you in the future. You could get kicked out of some universities for doing that (I know at mine you do.)

**Bring duct tape and a screwdriver.** Better yet, get a [mini tool kit.](http://www.amazon.com/Allied-49032-25-Piece-Tri-Fold-Mini/dp/B000EMBHHE) This has DEFINITELY helped out! I have a pink one that my aunt got at Target for $25.

**Get a job.** If you can work on campus, fantastic! It makes everything a hell of a lot easier. If you can't, it's still okay. It not only helps you pay for college, but it gets money in your pocket. Personally, I don't have a car, and the city I'm in isn't exactly the SAFEST, so I don't have one.

**Get an internship your junior/senior year. It gets your foot in the door.** As pointed out by luciphur.

**Don't buy your books before class.** You could waste a lot of money if you don't need the book.

**Find a balance between working and playing!** Don't stay souped up in your room the entire time, but don't spend your entire time partying, either!

**Join organizations on campus.** I am part of an improv group. Not only do I get out every weekend, I built friendships, the board members (president, vice president, etc.) can be used as references, I build my skills (I have noticed I'm more outgoing and not afraid to do what I want), and if you are part of an organization you are able to be a part of the board, which looks super amazing on resumes! Also, I know at my university, if you are a board member of an org, you get a Learning Beyond the Classroom credit, which you need to graduate.

**USE YOUR PROFESSOR'S OFFICE HOURS.** Most of the time, a lot of people don't go there. Even if you understand everything, go in there and talk to them. It builds a relationship, which helps in the professional world.

**At the end of the semester, MAKE SURE TO RETURN YOUR RENTED BOOKS.**

**Also, resell your books on Amazon, even if you didn't buy it on there. But also check your bookstore to see if they're buying books back.** My bookstore has a list of books they're buying back and for what price, so you can compare prices. I sold my speech book I bought on Amazon for $20 at the bookstore, whereas on Amazon I would've gotten like $5 for it.

**tekn0viking said: ""If you dont get up normally at 7 or 8 am. DON'T TAKE A 8/9/10AM CLASS! You will NOT get up for it.""**

**Use the librarians to your advantage.** ch0wtime: As a library intern at a university, I'd like to add on to your tip about the library. Don't just use the library to study, ask your reference librarians for help with your research papers! We know about all of the databases your university has to offer and are extremely willing to help you find any information/sources you need.

**Don't use Wikipedia as a source. Use the sources Wikipedia has as your sources.**

**Do your work! Do your readings!**

**Do not freak out.** Do not panic. Everything will get done, everything will turn out okay. I know my university offers twelve free counseling sessions, not really sure about any other universities though.

**Invest in a good backpack and shoes.** They will come in handy!

**Don't confuse boredom with hunger!**

**Make a list of homework.** It helps with procrastination.

**Take the stairs instead of the elevator.** It helps with the freshman fifteen and it normally is quicker/less crowded."

Where should I start applying for jobs (US)?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16gzqp/international_student_graduating_in_may_where/,"I'm an international student graduating in May with a Business degree (and tech literate, self-taught web dev/designer). I am able to work for a year under student visa via OPT to gain experience. I've definitely heard my share of horror stories that it's hard for international students to find jobs.

The pattern seems to be big companies have more options (ie perks, potential pay, resources to apply for a work visa if they're inclined) but are tougher to get into, while smaller companies are easier to get into but you do a lot more things (due to the few staff) and basically are the '1 year intern'. I'm not being too picky though as I'm mostly in it for the experience.

I'm in a small town in California and would like to work in a different city (I have the Bay Area, LA, Seattle or New York in mind). Where are some good places/websites that an international student can apply for jobs? Especially for smaller/lesser known companies which don't have a big presence.

I'm definitely having to apply to different cities since the small town I'm in offers few opportunities (even fewer for non-citizens); how do I find local job listings for other locations (which range from 300 to over a thousand miles away) without physically being there?

I'm sorry if I appear clueless but I haven't much experience looking for a job in the US and other international students aren't particularly willing to share information with each other =/ (best reluctant answer I've got from a friend was ""so how'd you get your job?"" ""online"", yup 1 word answer and a period)"
16gz5q,3,2013-01-12,How do I find a good internship?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16gz5q/how_do_i_find_a_good_internship/,"(You can skip this part if you wish, just keep in mind there cannot be a 3.0+ GPA requirement).

I have been searching online for an internship and they all seem to have outlandish requirements or GPA requirements cut off at 3.0. I have a 2.94. I will have a 3.0 by the end of this semester, but that is a bit too late for a summer internship.

I feel that my GPA is not an adequate representation of my ability or my intelligence, but I have no idea how to prove that. I have my high SAT scores, but that was over three years ago and it would seem silly to put them on my application. My university is no help; they only help students with a GPA of at least 3.0 to get internships. (In case you are curious of why my GPA is so low: major depression. I didn't transition into college very well and so my second semester of freshman year and my sophomore year really messed me up and I lost all motivation. I redeemed myself this semester, but it wasn't enough to get that 3.0.) I also realized that I never connected with any professors. This is another thing I regret. I felt like I was the underachieving student and he or she would not want to have anything to do with me or interrogate me about my grades. I have maybe one professor who would write something good about me because she loved how interested I was in her class.


I am a history major, but I am also interested in the video game industry (particularly game design), law and the government. I live in the US near Indianapolis (while in school) and I am willing to travel to the East or West Coast only if there is a stipend or it is paid (I am too poor to not have a stipend). 

I am tired of watching people in my graduating class who had worse grades than me and were even slackers getting internships in NYC, Los Angeles, while I am stuck here because my major and depression has pigeonholed me into an area with little opportunities."

1/2/2013

*Safety Not Guaranteed* follows a journalist and two interns going out to investigate an ad put out by a man claiming to be able to time travel. 

The film is split into two plots that converge multiple times. The A plot consists of one intern, Darius played by Aubrey Plaza investigating the odd Kenneth Calloway played by Mark Douglas. The B plot is the journalist character trying to rekindle a past relationship. The B plot does not enhance the story in anyway.

Mark Douglas steals the show as the paranoid Kenneth. He's entertaining and although neurotic, a character we feel empathy for. A lot of the minor characters have no purpose besides a few lines of dialogue.  

*Safety Not Guaranteed* does have charming qualities to it but in the end the story lacks enough interest built up in a film that deals with time travel.

I've just finished up school and have an internship under my belt and now I've started applying to a bunch of jobs.  I'd like to move out west and establish a career out there, I'm just looking for some advice or general guidelines on how this whole relocation thing works. 

I have two phone interviews set up for next week at smaller companies, one in California and one out in Colorado. I'm 99% sure relocation assistance is out of the question but I'm not sure how to proceed. Both people doing the hiring know I'm looking to relocate as I've put it on my résumé and they mentioned it in a follow up email. 

Anyway, during the phone interview I assume they will ask me when I'm available to start, I don't know exactly how to answer that. I would figure about one month so I can put in a notice at my current job and some time to pack up and leave, but I don't want to get rejected for taking too long. Also, would you suggest if/when I secure the job to take a trip out there before actually moving to find a place to live? Or if someone has gone through this situation any tips would be greatly appreciated.

A shit-ton of exposition because fuck ""show, don't tell"" right guys?

Anyhoo we finally get back to it, and after that refreshing Tolstoy novel we finally get a conflict in space, and wowee if it isn't a giant triangle firing green liquorice at a rocket powered hammer how fucking majestic. So the triangle finally gets its shit together and sends a bunch of polar bear soldiers to kick some ass, they then proceed to use their advanced tactical genius to enter through one hole into a tiny corridor rapidly filling with flying liquorice, luckily for them they have the super awesome King Gimp who arrests some bitch with a terrible taste in hairdressers.

But fuck that shit, I didn't come here to see fighting I want to follow some whiny prick in the middle of the desert. Well apparently this guy doesn't like living in a desert which is beyond me because its like a beach without that pesky water getting in the way. So despite having a bitchin car and eyes that would make cougar hunting a walk in the park, he instead goes out and buys a trash can and a pimped out sex doll, well luckily for us the bin has a message from the walking fashion disaster desperately asking for her stylist Ben Kenobi (designers have to have weird names, don't ask). Well the trash can decides the plot has to go somewhere and runs away, leading to our hero, Liam Sunstabber, meeting his first fashion blogger. Well Ben knows his shit and can see that Liam has a really good bone structure and a perfect winter complexion so he tells him about how there used to be loads of fashionistas roaming the galaxy dispensing sartorial justice but then the space equivalent of the 90s happened and it all went to shit, he then gives Liam his very own colour co-ordination rod.

Well Liam is still a bit of a prick and refuses to follow the way of the ""fit"" up until his aunt and uncle get killed, Because then. ITS. ON. 

And by ""ON"" I mean they take a quick trip into town to look for a space bus. Well public transport is for chumps and luckily they find the premier fashion tumblr user Hank Lonely who dodges like 50 bits of liquorice from a space kermit before throwing one back. One quick chat with a giant slug and we're finally back into the void, ready for some conflict, they head off to the new club thats opened in town, apparently the speakers are literally earth shattering.our boys finally rescue Miss Worst Dressed 5076 while totally rocking the polar bear suits. But dramaaaaaaa, King Gimp faces off against the Artist Formerly Known as Obi and it turns out he used to intern for him! He pulls out his colour co-ordination rod and shows off his totally sweet red and black wardrobe. But Ben is like ""Whatever, that is so last season"" and proceeds to school Gimpy's ass on how brown and blue is both more versatile and flattering before ascending to a higher level of sassiness. Hank declares he is ""over-it"" so the gang head out to moisturise and update their instagrams. 

But its not over yet because that new club is totally coming for them and taking out all the smaller independent spots that ""I've known about for years"" and ""I can't believe you haven't even heard about it"". So the gang get together some fellow mided free spirits who proceed to get into matching retro-chic orange jumpsuits and shoot some liquorice at this motherfucker. At first its a bit shit because the club has bigger liquorice but then Liam finally understands the meaning behind John Galiano's Spring 2011 line and shoots some liquorice right into the air conditioning or something which of course makes it explode.

Hooray, everyone gets medals apart from the giant ewok because his outfit was complete already.

Been together with my gf for 4 years (2008), this was during her last year of high school and my second. 
Been living together for 2 of theese. From september of 2010 when she had a year off from school and we both started college (she social studies and me economics).
Ever since we moved (to a new city, but only 1 hour drive/train away from original home town) we have had some problems. We were both young, moving directly from our parents house. 
In the beginning of the move, she went home like every weekend because she was home-sick. After like like ½ year she started going 2-3 times a month and after another ½ year she started being here (here as in our apartment). In our fourth semester that is currently on its last week, she had an internship in our old town and came here like 2-3 weekends a month. 
The thing is that we are now experience some problem...
We have never had that... ""big"" fight, but problems keep nagging at us. She feels that every time we argue, it stacks up on her consience and pile up. And I feel that since this she has been kinda ""depressed"", not so much, but she has not been very glad. And this has led to lack of, well, love from her side. Somthing I feel is kind of important. I have kind of a bad temper, but that I am aware of and working on. But when I try to be happy and show some love (hugs and kisses and things like that) i barley get any answer because of her light depression state. 
Today, we had a talk (which we havnt done, not about this anyways). 
We both agreed that we are kinda of unhappy with the current solution and something need to be done. We talked and the reason for all this we think is that we moved away ***from*** something, not *to* something. Well, we moved to study and living together. And also a reason is that we were young and we have evolved alot since we moved away from home, she because of her studies, and me because i left home (where I lived with a single dad, who was **always** right, and *never* wrong). Anyways, I think that a important part of why we are not as happy as we used to be, is because we dont do anything together. By that I mean on our spare time, exept cooking and eating and such.

What I ask you, reddit, is do you have any tips on how I can make this better for the both of us? 
Will try to answer questions if you have any.

Having problems with gf, want some help. We have maybe got stuck in bad habits.

The only problem is that my boss is making work a nightmare. She has enormous mood swings, is unbelievably high-strung and seems to make it her mission to take out her stress on others- namely, me. 


Before I started working there, it was the receptionist; a young, incredibly sweet and smart woman who everyone loves. My boss would order her around (although the receptionist was outside of her department), yell at her in front of everyone for the tiniest offense, and generally make her feel stupid and inadequate. 


Now that I'm the 'new girl', her attentions have turned to me. She seems to go out of her way to find things to criticize/take issue with. When she does, she is insulting, degrading, condescending, and makes it a point to do all this loudly enough so everyone can hear. She berates me for close to a half hour for a tiny mistake that is easily fixed. 


Because I help out multiple departments with different assignments, I know that I can't be doing as bad a job as she makes it seem. I get tons of compliments and appreciation from everyone else, including the company president. But my boss is sucking away my self-confidence and making me feel incompetent and stupid.


I'm not sure how to handle it- I want to keep my job, but I don't want to be treated this way anymore. I'm scared to make a scene/call her out on it because I fear that I may lose my job. Help!"

16k26z,2,2013-01-14,Need some career advice!,absurdfatalism,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/16k26z/need_some_career_advice/,"Hi r/ECE, I wanted to post this here rather than /r/engineeringstudents because I am looking for long term career advice.

I am currently pursuing a M.S. in computer engineering and I have to choose between two 6 month internships. Neither are 'big' name companies so I will leave them anonymous .

**Company A**

* High speed fiber optics telecom hardware
* I would be working in the FPGA division
* Had 6 month internship there 2 years ago (was a great experience)
* ^ Worked in the board-level design division (schematic and layout work)
* Would end up making less money (10-20% less than Company B)
* ~60 employees (seems likely to hire after graduation)

**Company B**

* Board-level controllers for power electronics (*schematic only*)
* Start up company ~10 employees (seems *unlikely* to hire after graduation)
* I would be one of 2-3 engineers (i.e. lots of experience doing schematic digital design)
* Also be involved with the business aspect of starting a company
* Would end up making more money than Company A

**My personal thoughts**

* I am divided between chip-level (FPGA) and board-level (digital) design.
* I already have PCB design on my resume, should I expand to include FPGA (Company A)?
* If I do FPGA then it is at a company that I worked at before - bad? FPGA and PCB at the same company?
* If I do the Company B board-level position I will be doing something I've already done (doesn't expand resume) but it is at a start up where I would get tons of experience.
* I have a desire to start a company at some point in my life but that may just be fanciful thinking.
* Company A has a long commute ~1.25 hours, Company B is within walking distance.


**TL/DR : A - worked there before (not showing variety of employers?), expands resume OR B - start-up, lots of experience, doesn't expand resume just makes one skill stronger.**

Ask me any questions to help clarify. Thanks so much!"

However I obtained a job at a small start-up company in western NY as a manufacturing chemist prior to my graduation in May. I started approximately the 2nd week of April. During my negotiation for the salary they brought up that I didn't graduate yet and will pay me the intern salary until I graduated they will provide me the competitive chemist salary, no benefits or compensation at all when I started. 

Graduation came and went, I requested a review and meeting when my 3 month probation came along and obtained a 4/5 overall rating from my manager. I went in unprepared for providing my case, thinking that they would give me a competitive salary. They gave me a 15% raise from my intern salary which is still 72% lower than the median for my degree, along with no other compensation benefits other than a stock initiative plan (being a small company isn't that valuable). Since I wasn't prepared to present my case to reach my major's median i had to take the 15% raise. 

Fast forward another 6 months and we almost shut down 2 times due to budgeting issues, I requested another review and obtained a 4/5 rating (which means exceeds expectations, they said they never give a 5/5 rating). I requested for another raise and came in prepared and confident. I presented my case on a friendly front saying is that i want to be well compensated for my performance and degree. Provided some minimal information about the market for someone with my experience and degree has the median of 72% more in base salary alone. Trying to be reasonable I requested another 15% raise and compensation for health benefits for my family (its very expensive paying benefits weekly without compensation). My manger said ""You gotta be kidding, you have a job and not working at a paper hat job. Be appreciative what you've got a job straight out of college and you'll never really make money, accept it and get out of my office and go back to work."" I was surprised because my manager is typically understanding and very involved, but this really put a wrench in my gears into my motivating factor. I'm already looking elsewhere due to my concerns about security. 

I was wondering if reddit has any advice or ideas about what to do?"

Well, I've grown up as a baptist in those fundamentalist churches that spread easily in small cities. I was always impressed by science, and didn't like the spiritual experience at all. It was ok for a long time, but then I became to wonder if I would really continue into this. I've always disagreed with some of the notions taught (e. g. the homosexual intolerance), and am really tempted to believe in evolution (a hot topic on the church indeed). After all, I never felt so faithful.

Back then I entered in a sort of internship school, and had the time to think about it without further pressure from family (aka ""where going to the church today, son""). Although I became to think seriously in abandoning the christian link and everything, it's just not easy to decide. The problem is that is not an easy decision to make: if you're wrong, you're going to hell, I guess. It would be just fine if God just sits with you after your death and says ""It's ok, we all make mistakes"", but that won't simply occur, haha.

Also, I'm back home for vacations and my mother keeps trying to take me to church, and I keep avoiding it as much as I can. If I choose to be atheist, I really don't know if I'm gonna tell her. It's also painful already to listen to gospel music and practice any religion based habit ATM.

Not really hoping reddit will solve this for me, but would like to know your thoughts about it, specially if you had a similar experience. If you would like to know further details (relevant, of course), I'll give them.

Note that when I talk about God above, it's in an hypothetical sense, don't take it seriously. Also, sorry if it's an innapropriate post for this reddit or whatever.


TL;DR: I'm thinking about becoming atheist, but because of family and worries about being wrong, I'm still stuck at the religion side.

I am 25, I have a college degree, working on finishing a university degree, I have a commission in the Canadian Army reserves, I have a boss who appreciates my skills and colleagues who like me and I enjoy their company, and I have 1/3 brothers that I have a good relationship with and some extended relatives that love me and I love them.

I graduated high school with good grades and enough scholarship money to pay for the first year of my college degree (took an Associates Degree) and worked to pay for it on my own. I got into a good university, moved from my home town, joined the army reserves to help pay for uni but also because I'd been thinking about it for years.

I changed my major because I found my original major wasn't leading anywhere, and my professors where getting annoyed with my constant questions of their conclusions/interpretations of the material.  Still working and no student debt after 4 years.  

Became involved with a couple of student groups that build professional skills, got an internship with one of the largest companies on earth (we can do work placement terms and then return for academic terms). Continue with the military on detached service, got promoted.

Came back, had a pretty good year academic wise, had a relatively good relationship with a caring girlfriend, continued to work with student groups but simplified my life, did okay. I got some interviews for more internships, but no job offers. Broke up with gf before going on a summer posting training people.  Had the worst supervising officer (incompetent, interfered with my job, generally not very good at it - filled in for him on his time off in addition to my own job and did it better than him), was promoted again, was understaffed and under-supported, had amazing NCOs and platoon was best on base. Came back, sunk into a depression again due to PTSD like encounter with emotionally abusive parents, chucked a whole term due to depression (did one course, no intern applications). Starting new term, headhunted by major company in New York to apply for position through LinkedIn (haven't heard back). Still debt free, but feeling really low on self-worth atm.

I exercise, socialize, not depressed - just tired of the struggle a bit (both life and family), and feeling a little drained and lost.

So we ended back at the end of july and now to this day things still do not seem to be any better. We had planned to move in together but I felt I wasn't ready yet and decided that she should go to college as it would be a great oppertunity for her and her career, however this would result in us going long distance to which after a week or two resulted in us ending.

Since then I have felt miserable. What makes things worse is that this year I am doing an internship with my Father's company which I despise and dread going into every single morning. The fact that it is not a college year were I would see my friends often is making this really really difficult .I also have no job or money as this internship (like many) is unpaid. So rarely do I have the money to go out, socialise, and meet new people.

For a while things did seem to get better. I joined MMA which I do three times a week and also jog 5km five and sometimes seven days a week. However for the past few weeks I've started to have dreams about her again and now it feels like im stuck back to were I was in the beginning. I also mistakenly went on to her friends facebook the other day to which I saw the usual dreaded pictures of her having an awesome time.

She has family were I live to which she came home to visit  a few weeks back. She did email me to my surprise however the email stated that she had been home and the reason she didn't want to see me was because she felt that I would have been a distraction from seeing her family and friends( i don't understand this part really). She then stated that we could meet up on a specific day and that if we didn't then it wasn't meant to be. Of course we didn't because I was busy at the time and just replied ""sorry im busy!"" giving the I dont give a shit approach which I regret now even though it may have been the best thing to do.

Anyways thats my story. 6 months later and still feel like shit. I just d'ont know what to do anymore especially not having money to go out and doing something i hate 5 days a week.

**GOHAN THE PAIGE BOY**

Another day, another internship. It was DC, bitches, and Gohan valued himself a yup and gup courier, so he knew he wouldn't be on his knees to face that twink, Trunks. ""What a liberal!"" Gohan thought. After all, Trunks's dad wasn't even FROM Earth and probably believed in some pagan bs where they dance around fires and slap their dicks on wood like beaver buddies. Gohan went to the door, looked at the knob, turned the knob, then opened the door and looked inside. The room was really boring, probably the site of some slutty library bitches, maybe get a handjob or two and screw somebody, who knows. ""Fuck bitches, get money!"" was Gohan's motto. Gohan just knew he had to get it, get it done and get HIM done.

Gohan strolled down the halls of Congress and high fived every conservative politician he saw. Go Gohan, you little slut! Rudy Giuliani even gave him a quick nod. Both of them were so happy, because they had just finished a major bill to show that America was founded on Christian values, and Gohan was a good Christian. Well, mostly. ;)

He made his way to John McCain's side of the aisle. In-between watching Nick Arcade reruns on his iPod Touch (which wasn't a very good video player and Gohan should have really returned it) Gohan was editing the bio for McCain on conservapedia, so he knew all about how handsome our John was in his early years. Honestly though he was still a little bit hot and Gohan saw the potential. He resisted.

It was only until McCain had to vote against the socialist health care bill that Gohan couldn't contain himself. Dickitude! McCain thought back to his Feingold days. He knew a bipartisan effort was necessary to get that thing through. And man, he really wanted to get it through. When he finished his final point, Gohan saw his own pubes going gold with Christian Saiyan horniness. All the middlin biddlin bits in his butt were going going going.

Right then and there, Gohan powered up to Super Saiyan 2, flew to John McCain and took him to an empty congressional office. ""What's goin' on here?!"" John asked. ""Mr. McCain, take this!"" Gohan reached out his pocket and gave McCain a Senzu bean. Suddenly McCain was just as hot as he was in his 20s. ""Oh my stars!"" John said in shock. ""I could run for president with these kind of looks!"" Gohan agreed. ""I'd vote for you,"" he said.

""You know, a good ol' boy like you could really use a favor..."" John seductively took of Gohan's gi. (oooooohhhh yeah) Gohan knew Piccolo would be proud, because he just finished reaching Super Saiyan 2 and he was strong enough to defeat even Osama Bin Laden. Brown things never turned Gohan on though even though Gohan owned the brown Android G1 becaus his iPod Touch sucked so much. McCain was white like an angel with a dick like Zeus. Gohan's body was rock hard, hot, and oiled with sweat. John's body was just as hot as it was when he was stuck in that gook box in 'nam. They were ready to FUCK!

Gohan's dick launched an all out war on John's sweet ass. First Gohan felt the rim of John's anus against his tip, then it slid in no problem, inch by inch until Gohan was balls deep inside McCain's bubble butt. ""Oh boy, it's in!"" shouted McCain. ""I've never felt anything like this."" Yeah you didn't John you hot little bitch, bc Gohan's dick is a 11.5 inch Saiyan monster. Gohan grabbed McCain's nice thighs with his hands and held him up in the air, fucking and fucking his ass as McCain screamed with glory each time. John's big American balls slapped against Gohan's dick with each thrust. Gohan dug his face into John's back, smearing the sweat all over his face, biting and sucking and licking each muscle, then he grabbed McCain's hard American cock and fap fap fapped McCain.

High up in the air McCain kept screaming. ""Oh my god! Oh my god!"" Yeah, you KNOW Gohan liked it, seein all of that massive Saiyan dick up in that deep conservative ass.

""Say I own your ass! Say it! Say it bitch!""

""AHHHH! GOHAN, YOU OWN MY ASS!""

""Now where should my cum be, you hot little slut?""

""D... DEEP IN MY AAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!""

It all exploded inside McCain. The hot, gold Saiyan cum filled his ass, gushed out of his anus and ran all down Gohan's dick. He knew all of the hot conservative boys in Congress were watching them fuck up in the air and he knew they couldn't get enough of it. They even opened their mouths to catch the cum drops falling out of John's ass. His fantasy finally happened: Gohan's cum had filled a true conservative's ass. He couldn't be happier. He felt like a hero. He WAS a hero.

Didn't know how else to sum up.

Anyhow, I am a recent college graduate (21 years old) in a technical field who is about to start work at a huge tech corporation. I am moving across the country to a new city in two weeks and am having questions about how to even transition from being a college student to a functioning member of society (especially in a new city). Most the people in my life are men - and their advice is mostly the same (usually related to finances in some way/shape/form). I just have a few questions that I'd like to get the female perspective. Answer whichever you feel comfortable with and personal anecdotes are always welcome.

- How did the transition from school to work go for you? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
- For any ladies in the corporate world, how did you overcome the condescension from coworkers for being young? Is it just a ""wait it out"" type thing?
- Related to above if anyone is in a technical field: how do you overcome men treating you different, especially male superiors? (I've ran into this before in internships, hence why I'm asking.)
- How do you meet people outside of work? I'd like to meet other ladies my age (as friends), but I now don't know how to do that without school, and there aren't many women in my field. Any ideas on how to be social in the real world?
- How do I appear older? I tried changing my wardrobe (cardigans, scarves, boots, blazers, long necklaces), but still get the same bad service in restaurants and bars. Anyone else experience this? Anything you did ever help it?
- I would like to learn to cook. I have a college diet still, and eat out a lot. What recipes/cook books are good for a beginner? What kitchen supplies do I need to buy that one wouldn't ordinarily think of?
- I would also like to learn how to sew. Don't even know where to start on that one...

These are just a few. Anything else that maybe you guys struggled with or things you may think would be helpful are always welcome."

You do spend time on support and there is lot more design, discussions and documentation work - it is certainly not like Swordfish with a lone guy in a dark room typing out thousands of lines of code a day :).  biggest perk: ability to ship code that millions of people use. Its a humbling experience, that's what motivates me to get up in the morning and go to work. Apple is a great company and the source of the renaissance in the consumer tech industry. Focus is back on apps and devices, whereas for a time there it looked like Web was winning and Google wsas on its way to being the undisputed winner.

16jf2n,1,2013-01-14,What's wrong with my interview technique?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16jf2n/whats_wrong_with_my_interview_technique/,"Background: I like to think that I'm good at public speaking/BSing.  Won best delegate at Model United Nations, won several debate prizes, got an offer to read Law at Oxbridge (which required an intense interview that basically tested how good I was at reasoning).

But for some reason, I'm not that good at interviewing for positions - if that makes sense.  Just today, I was interviewing for an internship position in my student government that should've given me a 50% chance of success - and I didn't get it.  I thought that I did pretty damn well - it was a group interview with around 7 people, and I was more confident and spoke more clearly than around 5 of the other people at the very least.

My nagging suspicion is that I'm good at showing people that I'm smart, but not good at getting people to like me.  Maybe, I treat interviews more as an adversarial thing than a 'getting people to like me' thing.  Maybe I'm too cocky in interviews (although I don't try intentionally to be cocky).

Thoughts/comments? How should I improve this?

Also, is there a better subreddit that I could post this to?"

I'm looking for a summer internship in the Bay Area. Nothing particularly fancy either. I just want some relevant industry experience. 

I've taken Calculus 1-3, Linear Algebra, about to take Discrete Mathematics, Java Programming, various C++ courses including OOP and Data Structures, an intro UNIX/Linux course, and Assembly Language Programming is planned for the upcoming semester. 

I'll be honest, I'm extremely mediocre at programming. Although I've worked hard in all my courses, my programming skills have been improving very very slowly. If I'm stuck with a problem, I'll spend a lot of time working out a solution and coming pretty close to it. But I always need help from a professor or intelligent colleague to get it 100%.  

In an academic setting I do alright with the programming labs, but I've looked at some standard interview questions and don't quite understand how to work with complicated brain twisters or algorithmic problems. I guess my programming knowledge is still weak.

I'm not sure what to do. I really want an internship, but I don't want to waste anybody's time by applying and then completely bombing the interview. Application deadlines are coming up in the next few months so I need to think of something. Any insight would be appreciated."

I originally posted this in /r/seddit, but I think my post got buried, so I was hoping this subreddit would be able to provide some insight. 


I've run into a predicament and would appreciate any advice that is provided. About 5 months ago, I worked with a girl a couple times while she was doing an internship; our companies were working together on a project. I only spent a couple hours with this girl on several occasions, but we hit it off pretty well and I ended up getting her number. She was 20 at that time, but said she had a fake, so we were going to go out to a bar with my friends and her friends. Lo and behold, I got deathly sick, and couldn't make it out. She connects with me on Linkedin and we haven't spoken/messaged/texted or anything since.


I honestly got scared and lost confidence in myself (I'm out of her league and she's HB8), so I kept pushing it off to contact her again (the internship ended and she went back to the east coast for school, I'm on the west coast). This was pre-seddit information gathering and research, so I wanted to see if there was any shot of me revisiting this situation and trying to go on a date or at least hang out with her.
She's still in college, but graduating this year. She's originally from the west coast and her family lives in the same city I recently moved to. I don't have her email or Facebook. I stiill have her number, but I feel like it would be weird/creepy if I randomly texted her...I doubt she even saved my number to be honest. Hence, I was going to shoot her a message on Linkedin. I figured the worst case- she'll a) won't respond, b) say no, c) tell me to never contact her again, or d) tell me she now has a boyfriend and implying a ""no"".



Here is what I was going to write: ""Hey Megan, it's been a while! Long time no talk, hope you're doing well. I was talking to Ashley [her former supervisor at the company that I still partner/work with], and we were just talking about what's been new, and etc. I recently moved to (city) and remembered that you're from here too. I don't know when you'll be around again, but would you like to grab some coffee and catch up? -notsureandconfused""


Again, I only spent maybe less than 10 hours with this girl during girl. So when I say ""catch up"" I feel like it's awkward for me to say that because we were acquaintances from two different companies doing work on a project...but I don't know what else to say. Should I send this message, change it, or consider this a lost cause? Thanks again for reading, and for the advice!


Side note- while I've been reading /r/seduction and this subreddit, I'm still learning and trying to improve myself, as well as my self-esteem and confidence. That said, I'm tired of sitting on the sidelines, and want to start having fun."

I am mentally killing myself for this but trying so hard to let myself feel the relief of the lifted weight. Dropping this one class and taking it over the summer will buy me several months to work on my thesis and save me from mental breakdown. I have to do this for myself.

I guess this wall of text is just my roundabout way of venting about my inner demons and I am just wondering if there are any other perfectionists out there that are killing themselves like I am?"

My girlfriend and I have been long distance since then.  We had hoped that she would be accepted into grad school in the city I am living in but that school turned her down.  It looks like she is very likely to be accepted into my Midwestern alma mater, however.  Because of this I am planning on relocating back there after I have been in my current position for a full year.

I had a strong academic record and strong experience with internships and research positions so when I was looking for jobs coming out of school I was in fairly high demand.  I imagine that leaving my current job after just a year may raise some red flags for recruiters and hiring managers though.


How should I handle the inevitable questions about why I am job searching again?  Should I acknowledge my situation in the cover letters I send with my resume?  For the recruiters out there, how much would you hold my situation against me looking for a new job?

I honestly got scared and lost confidence in myself (I'm out of her league and she's HB8), so I kept pushing it off to contact her again (the internship ended and she went back to the east coast for school, I'm on the west coast). This was pre-seddit information gathering and research, so I wanted to see if there was any shot of me revisiting this situation and trying to go on a date or at least hang out with her. 


She's still in college, but graduating this year. She's originally from the west coast and her family lives in the same city I recently moved to. I don't have her email or Facebook. I stiill have her number, but I feel like it would be weird/creepy if I randomly texted her...I doubt she even saved my number to be honest. Hence, I was going to shoot her a message on Linkedin. I figured the worst case- she'll a) won't respond, b) say no, c) tell me to never contact her again, or d) tell me she now has a boyfriend and implying a ""no"". 


Here is what I was going to write: ""Hey Megan, it's been a while! Long time no talk, hope you're doing well. I was talking to Ashley [her former supervisor at the company that I still partner/work with], and we were just talking about what's been new, and etc. I recently moved to (city) and remembered that you're from here too. I don't know when you'll be around again, but would you like to grab some coffee and catch up? -notsureandconfused""


Again, I *only* spent maybe less than 10 hours with this girl during girl. So when I say ""catch up"" I feel like it's awkward for me to say that because we were acquaintances from two different companies doing work on a project...but I don't know what else to say. Should I send this message, change it, or consider this a lost cause? Thanks again for reading, and for the advice!


Side note- while I've been reading /r/seduction, I'm still learning and trying to improve myself, as well as my self-esteem and confidence. That said, I'm tired of sitting on the sidelines, and want to start having fun. "

The issue is that this internship is non-paid and I will have to eventually relocate. The type of web development I'm doing is something I'm good at but not what I want to be apart of for numerous reasons, one being the money. There is also the fact that they will expect 20-40hrs each week, which for unpaid web development is unheard of (Albeit an entry level programmer, I do know what I'm doing). I have one final interview this week. How should I approach this. Is it better to politely say I'm not interested or should I just go through with the interview.

""Dear Mr. Bouley:
 
My name is Matthew Ross and I am an undergraduate finance student at San Diego State University (SDSU). I met you the summer before last at Smith &amp; Wollensky’s in New York when I was touring the east coast with my uncle, who is a MLB Umpire. I just wanted thank you for taking the time to talk to me that night. 
 
I am writing you to inquire about a possible summer internship in your office. I am aware it is highly unusual for undergraduates from average universities like SDSU to intern at Duff and Phelps, but nevertheless I was hoping you might make an exception. I am extremely interested in investment banking and would love nothing more than to learn under your tutelage. I have no qualms about fetching coffee, shining shoes or picking up laundry, and will work for next to nothing. In all honesty, I just want to be around professionals in the industry and gain as much knowledge as I can. 
 
I won’t waste your time inflating my credentials, throwing around exaggerated job titles, or feeding you a line of crap about how my past experiences and skill set align perfectly for an investment banking internship. The truth is I have no unbelievably special skills or genius eccentricities, but I do have a near perfect GPA and will work hard for you. I’ve interned for Merrill Lynch in the Wealth Management Division and taken an investment banking class at SDSU, for whatever that is worth.
 
I am currently awaiting admission results for SDSU’s Masters of Science in Accountancy program, which I would begin this fall if admitted. I am also planning on attending law school after my master’s program, which we spoke about in New York. I apologize for the blunt nature of my letter, but I hope you seriously consider taking me under your wing this summer. I have attached my resume for your review. Feel free to call me at (###) ###-####, or email at matthew.ross2@yahoo.com. Thank you for your time.

I'm a master's student in CS with a few internships under my belt in development.  I'm looking into a program manager internship this summer, but I'm not registered for any more engineering/development classes, because I'm not sure that's what I want to do.  Now, I could register for one, but it conflicts with a very important statistics class that I should take.  

I recently discovered data analysis and I want to go be a data scientist so I'm thinking about applying for PhD programs, so this stats class is important.  However, I'm not completely committed to it, and by GPA isn't that great.  I'm just starting the second semester of grad school.

So, what I'm asking is, is how did you know you definitely wanted to get a PhD, and what kinds of decisions did you have to make?  What sacrifices did you make, and what was your persuading factor in getting deciding to get your doctorate?

Also, I'm uncertain about whether or not I should take this class.  I'm interviewing for an amazing internship and the class is part of a software development subtrack at my school, and could be the difference between getting an offer after the internship or not.  What do you think?

Thank you all so much.  This is a great subreddit and I try to contribute more than I ask.  I really love seeing so many people of all age and experience levels going into the field and sharing my passion.  "

In July I started smoking maybe once or twice a week. Classes started back up in August and after going to class in the morning, then working 8 hours at night, it was nice to come home at 10pm and smoke a bowl and get a nice little buzz. It was the same as drinking 3-4 beers to me, but didn't take an hour to do.

My work ended in October (seasonal job) and I kept smoking every evening, 8pm and after. At some point in November I started smoking every night at 5pm, and then a little earlier. I never went to class or work high, I never drove high, I never put myself or anyone in any real danger. An eighth was $50 and since I packed small bowls, it would last me a month or two. Cheaper than beer.

I finished all my weed right before exams in December. I knew I needed to buckle down and since I would be going home to live with my parents for the break, I needed to just let go of it for the month. While I was home I went ~3 weeks without smoking and felt fine. I bought a half oz to bring back up to school. I had a good hookup back home so I got it cheap while I could. Anyways, i've been back at college for a little over a week and all I've done is smoke pot.

Since I live with my 3 roommates/friends, and we always hang out, we usually only go to other peoples' apartments for weekends/parties/etc, since everyone is so busy during the week. I live in a really rainy area too, so it's been keeping me inside which hasn't helped with the smoking. I realized I haven't hung out with any of my other friends since November. I don't know if it's all a mutual thing, or if they just don't care that they haven't seen me. 

So now i'm in a rut where I think my friends don't really like me anymore, and i've convinced myself that my dog doesn't even like me (which I know isn't true). When i'm not high, I think ""man I don't need to smoke, why not save it for special occasions"", but then once i'm home I get bored and spark up. After about an hour I start to feel bad about smoking. I get the idea that my roommates hate me and think of me as a junkie even though I know that's not really true. They smoke with me once or twice a week but not everyday. 

To make it all worse, I've still got feelings for my ex who I dumped almost two years ago, and my relationship with my current girlfriend has been on the decline for a while. I've probably forgotten a lot of details but i'll add them if comments spark ideas as to why I started writing this.

**Edit**: When I started smoking, I liked it because I got buzzed and giggly. I actually felt emotions, which wasn't all that common for me (example: I've had close people die and rather than crying and mourning, i've always been like ""wow that's sad...but it's life and it happens""). Now when I smoke I just get cloudy-minded. I can't enjoy Reddit because I can't focus enough to make it through a paragraph. Only other options in the apartment are Netflix and video games, which don't entertain me much longer. I love taking my dog for long walks on nice sunny days, but they're few and far between where I live. I really enjoy snowboarding but this season has sucked and hasn't given me many days on the mountain.

**tl;dr**: I first liked smoking because it brought the emotions and feelings out of me, but now I feel like it's sucked the life out of me.

 It's hard to not smoke weed when it's sitting right in front of me. I would have no problem not smoking if I ran out, because I would be able to justify not buying anymore. I can't quite bring myself to throw it out though. My life feels so dull. All of my close friends have girlfriends which makes them less available to hang out. My hobbies are all useless right now (snowboarding: weather sucks, motorcycle: it's too cold, cars: can't work on cars in an apt complex). I need new hobbies but nothing else even sounds interesting. I'm going crazy in my apartment.

With all that said, i'm still finishing up my Junior year at a university, 3.4 GPA, secured an awesome internship for the summer."

This hospital used to have a standard method for getting students into shadowing, but due to changes in policy (HIPAA etc) they've had to severely cut back on who they allow to shadow physicians. Because of the people I've worked with here, I have access to a pretty wide variety of physicians, but I have some questions before I head into this.

Is it normal to not be able to follow the doctor into the patient's room? I wasn't sure about this, but my boss (not a physician) told me that they don't allow that. Is this standard practice everywhere, or should I try to find a hospital where I'll see some doctor/patient interaction? I've yet to meet with the physician who is going to set up my shadowing, so I'm not sure if this is actually the policy.

Finally, to anyone who's done it, what is shadowing actually like? What should I expect going into this?"

**First, the background:**

In may I'll be graduating in chemical engineering (GPA 3.2) but I also want to be able to go and work in aerospace. I realize that my desires are a bit unusual for my discipline but I've had a couple of internships at NASA and feel like I could hang with the big dogs.

However, I'm almost positive that just by my major, I'll be looked down on for not being a mechanical, aerospace, or electrical. ChemE just doesn't seem to be *as* applicable to space engineering as others.

I'm applying for jobs in Aerospace, and graduate programs.



**My question/s:**

1. How reasonable is it to think I can get a job in aerospace/space?

2. If a job is a bit of a stretch, will my internship experiences (1. nanotech, 2. materials) and engineering degree get me into a space-applicable engineering program, such as mechanical or aerospace?

**TL;DR: Degree in chemical engineering with 2 internships at NASA. Reasonable to think I can get a job in aerospace, or should I go for a graduate degree, or am I just SOL?**

We argue quite a bit, most of it stemming from me not having a job. Now, I've had jobs, I've had multiple jobs at once. But, I hit a serious low in my life a few years ago (similar to this) and decided to go back to school (for film). My parents, being the supportive parents they are, agreed to help me. 

Here's a little backstory about me and my parents:

I am adopted. They got me when I was 2 months old and informed me of it as soon as I could comprehend what it meant. They've always supported me, even probably when they shouldn't have. I suppose since they couldn't have children I was more *special* to them because of it. They always bailed me out of trouble, and I was in quite a bit as a teenager. My dad was strict, always punished me (sometimes too much IMO) but my mom always compensated by letting me walk all over her. 

So when I decided to go back to school, they agreed to help me (financially) get set up in a new city and all that jazz. Well, months go by and I'm so busy (school, partying, trying to get laid) that I don't get a job. That was over 2 years ago.

Now I have less than a year of school left and I hate it. I hate going to these classes knowing how much I'm paying for them vs. how much I'm actually learning. I'm completely unmotivated to do anything but the bare minimum. I'm going into a field where networking is key and I haven't done near the amount of projects outside of class as everyone else. The thing that kills me is I'm GOOD. I was voted best in quarter for a script I wrote my first year. My videos have been featured in the demo reels for our entire film department. I love being creative. But lately, I just sit on my couch, and smoke pot. 

Now please don't go blaming the pot. I'm not blaming the pot. I agree that if I would say, wait until the evening to smoke that I may have a bit more motivation. But even when I don't have any, I just wake up, and walk around like a zombie. I've withdrawn from classes this quarter in an attempt to pursue a job and an internship, but I haven't made one move. My GF is sick of it to the point where I know she can't take it much longer. The only reason she's still here is b/c she actually loves me. But that's not even enough for me to put my heart into looking for a job. And YES, I love her. I don't ever want anyone else, she's it for me. That's not the problem. 

Also, I'm fat. When I came to the film school I weighed 215 lbs standing at 5'11"". I'm kinda big all over (not just in the gut) so 215 fits me pretty well. I now weigh 255 lbs. and I feel like shit. I know exercising would make me feel 1000x better but I'm keeping myself from doing it, and I don't know why. 

I just want to escape my own brain for a while, or stop time and sleep for a month. I just want to cry over all this for a whole day while the earth waits for me. I don't know what direction to take, or what the first step to getting back to being me is, and even if I did, I'd probably be to slack to take it. Someone help.

**TL;DR**  Pathetic 29yo spoiled single child can't find motivation to do anything for himself even if it means his relationship with his future wife falling apart and not getting a film degree with 9 months left.

16mxpr,322,2013-01-15,My 1 year experience from internship to full time job.,viceflow,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/16mxpr/my_1_year_experience_from_internship_to_full_time/,"So here's my story :

When I was 25 back in 2008 I decided to get a bachelor degree in Computer Science. At that time I was working as a Front Desk clerk for a resort here in Cancun. So I managed to convince my boss to let me study in the mornings and work on the evening. So basically I was in school through the morning and then to work.

Four years passed and its 2012. Got my bachelor degree and really wanted to leave the front desk job and start taking advantage from my degree. My main goal since I started university was to learn to code, and to be honest... I learned almost nothing .. lol... See when you study and work it gets pretty hard to even coupe with homework even worse when you only have one day off so I learn some bits of C++ and Java here and there enough to pass terms.

So as I was saying , its 2012 and I need to get a job on IT , I really didn't wanted to work at Help Desk fixing printers, I wanted to code and build software, the only problems was that most companies needed at least 3 year experience... fuck my life.So I made a huge decision and started to look for a internship somewhere in Cancun... I started to send emails to a few companies (to my surprise there's around 8 software companies down here) . 1 week later I got an email back from one of them, they ask me if I could come over for an Interview. Feeling nervous and dumb there I went.. lol I remember they ask me to do two exercises... the first one was to take any kind of string and reverse it.. without using functions...(they use Java) the other I don't remember cause I fail miserably on both... I got to nervous and couldn't think of a solution...  bummer. They said....thank you.. we will call you, ouch.

A month pass by and suddenly I got another email. Another company , .NET developers, 10 minutes from home(holy shit) for an internship. You see from the few things I was able to learn in university was C#. My final project was made in it so that help me a lot. Ok so , they ask me to do online test's for basic and some advance C# features + TSQL. I didn't fail miserably but got enough basic concepts to got me another interview. 

The interview goes pretty good, they like the fact that I speak English since most of their clients are from Canada and the US. They offer me an internship position for 6 months. After that time I have to take a certification test to see how much I learned, plus they gonna paid me(around 500USD a month). So I said.... fuck it lets do this. The only downside... the job was from 9am to 6pm... shit... what I'm gonna do with the front desk job?? I talked to my boss in the resort and told him I need to work in the evening shift. He was OK with it, on the internship place I convince them to let me work from 9 to 2pm even without pay, they agree and still pay me. For 4 months I spend all day working like literally ,I started the internship at 9am then rush out at 2pm and start at 3pm at the resort were I leave at 11pm. 

This was from Monday to Friday. So as you can imagine I started to feel miserably.

On the other hand... I was learning a lot.

Right away I get my hands on books , courses and videos on everything .NET.

They put me on a MVC4 project that was going to start from zero. The project leader was kind enough to go easy on me and started to explain everything... so there I was learning Entity Framework, MVC, Repositories, Moq,SCRUM  .... at some point my brain almost explode from all that information.

One day I talk to the wife and decided to leave the front desk job. This was like 4 months into the internship , I really wanted to get that certification. 

As you can imagine I pass the certification and land me the full time job.

Its been almost 1 year since I decided to do a complete change on my life. I think it was a good decision.

So far I been working with ASP, SQL server, MVC, Jquery, JavaScript, Unit Test,Reporting Services  and hope to get a new certification in a couple of months in HTML 5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

So , thank you learnprogamming cause some of the stuff I studied / study comes from here !

Thank you all for taking the time to read my story. I feel very humble reading everything here.

In my experience at least with C#/.NET this things help me a lot :

[Code School](http://www.codeschool.com)

Good examples of how to do this and that project

[DotNet Curry](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/)
Nice blog with examples

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
Always a starting point if you feel lost through a project or how to do x task.

Like I said previously you are never to old to learn and apply something new. Life is funny on how the decisions that you make change everything. Something that I realize now that I'm close to 30 is that you need to plan ahead, don't plan for today but for tomorrow. Save money, invest in your development , that steam game can wait. 

The rewards will come sooner or later but it's up to you.

The problem with this is that a couple of bank statements for a client got lost, and I was just informed by one of my bosses that he'd be making an example of it during our weekly meeting on Friday. 

I told him I didn't appreciate that, already felt embarrassed enough (this is a real problem client, abusive/arrogant and is just generally rude) because I don't like feeling like my work is less than stellar and that I didn't feel that calling me out personally was necessary to address that we need to make sure to be more diligent about scanning. 

He said he'd talk to the Partner and see. He said it wasn't malicious, and I don't really care if it is or not, my opinion is that it's unprofessional and inherently malicious to do that.

There is [an exemption](
http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=E#employee%20in%20the%20computer%20software%20field) for employees in the computer software industry meeting a fairly narrowing set of criteria. These criteria have several exceptions, two of which are as follows:

&gt;* The employee is a trainee or employee in an entry-level position who is learning to become proficient in the theoretical and practical application of highly specialized information to computer systems analysis, programming, and software engineering.

&gt; * The employee is in a computer-related occupation but has not attained the level of skill and expertise necessary to work independently and without close supervision.

To me, this sounds very much like an intern. If that's the case, shouldn't employers be required to pay their interns overtime? We all know that startup culture -- if not the employers directly -- encourages employees to work more than 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week. Interns are no exception. 

I feel as though I must be mistaken given that this is the status quo, but the legal facts seem pretty clear. Does anyone know if I'm missing something?

To be clear, I'm not an intern (anymore), and I have no interest in pursuing legal action. I'd just like to understand what's going on here."

16mvux,8,2013-01-15,Tell us your story!,stiverino,entrylevel,https://www.reddit.com/r/entrylevel/comments/16mvux/tell_us_your_story/,"A little background about myself:

I graduated in 2009 with a BS in Communications.

After graduation, I worked for a radio station as a promotions assistant and struggled to find my niche in a competitive job market.  As money grew tight, I switched to part time at the radio station and worked full time at a restaurant.

After months of pounding CareerBuilder and Monster.com listings with little success, I was able to obtain a part-time internship with a legal services website in June of 2010.  I was working upwards of 60-70 hours per week, including my hours at the restaurant.

I never stopped pursuing a true career job.  With what little personal time I had remaining with my long work days, I would send out 1-2 applications a day, customizing my resume and writing a new cover letter to fit each job description as best as I could.

6 months went by with not as much as a nibble.

Finally, I decided to cast a wider net.  I knew the economic downturn in my area (rural New England) had really taken its toll on the availability of jobs for people my age.  I turned my attention out of state.

My first interview offer was with a large Electronic Medical Record (EMR) company in Wisconsin.  They flew me out (as they did many young college grads) and subjected me to a pretty rigorous interview process.  I ended up not getting the position, but was not discouraged.  I knew now that employment opportunities were out there, and I knew I had the chops to be considered.  The only thing left was learning how to close.

I continued applying to jobs all over the country and was eventually given an interview thanks to a referral from an old friend, this time with a medical software startup in Southern California.

Again, it was a rigorous interview process.  This time, I came in and tried to reflect an air of confidence (but not arrogance) with firm ideas about how I would not only fulfill their requirements, but exceed their expectations.

After the interview, I asked for the business cards of everyone I sat with and emailed them individually a day later, thanking them for the opportunity for the interview.

I was hired a week later.

I am now two years into my employment as an Implementation Specialist for the same startup medical software company."

Just been prescribed citalopram.,yeebles,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/16mutt/thinks_started_getting_real_help_just_been/,"Hi. I'll keep this short. But over the past year, life has been pretty bad for me. I suffered a bad break-up, I graduated to a life of unemployment, was a burden on my parents, moved away from all my friends and have been rejected from countless of job applications. Which has had a pretty negative effect on me. I mean I'm was not exactly a happy person before but it definitely made it worse.

After eventually emotionally breaking down to my mum (who is a counsellor) she suggested I book to go to my GP to seek help for depression. So I went there talked about my feelings and mood. She suggested CBT and  a 20mg does of citalopram. 

Now I'm reading all this stuff about citalopram and am worrying a bit about the side effects. To top it off, I'm starting to re-assess whether I really am depressed and is it just the situation leading to this terrible mood.

A few days after booking my appointment I started getting offers for interviews for internships and got asked out on a date and starting feeling better. When I went to my GP I was noticeably in a better mood than when I booked and now I fear maybe I was keyhole-ing myself into what I felt before.

So I've taken the first tablet. And now I'm fearing becoming dependent on them (as they seem to be difficult to get off). I see my GP again next week. Should I continue, at the risk that maybe I'm better than she thinks I am.

Any thoughts would be appreciated."

Lied about it, invited me out to NM to visit her at her summer internship, meet the guy (unknowingly at the time), and then dump me.  A month later I found out from my roommate of all people that she had cheated on me and that's why she dumped me but didn't have the heart to tell me.  The fucked up thing is I had started seeing this girl after she dumped me.  When my ex came back I fucked up and slept with her again before I found out she cheated on me.  Basically I ended up cheating on my new girlfriend and did the exact same thing my ex did to me.  Cheat.  Ever since then I've been back and forth with both girls.  Not being completely honest about how I felt I used the new girl as a crutch to move past my cheating ex.  

Now I've been only talking some to my new girl.  We weren't dating officially, but talking.  Last week we had sex for the first time in weeks.  I freaked out b/c I still had feelings for my ex.  I ended up calling my ex later that week and tried to get back with her.  However I had waited to late.  She didn't want to be with me and said she had moved on from us.  After much crying by me and talking I could see in her face that she really didn't want to be in a relationship with me.  It really hurt and I felt like a dumbass.  Now the most fucked up thing is we ended up having sex again.  After she said she regretted it b/c she didn't want to give me hope and lead me on to thinking we could be together.  

Even though I'm not dating the other girl, I did have sex with her last week.  Now I have to tell her the truth that I basically cheated on her again.  I can't believe I did the same thing that hurt me extremely by my ex and left me in a deep depression for months. 

I have to stop blaming other people for my situation.  I've hurt both of the girls and I have to stop.  I have a serious mental health problem.  I need to be comfortable with myself before I can be with anyone.  I'm going to tell Mary I cheated on her yesterday with my ex.  It's going to destroy her but I have to tell her.  If there's any chance of us working out, the truth has to be told.  I'm not sure how this will work out, but I have to move on.  "

When I go into a store and ask if ""they're hiring"" I'm told to apply online. If I talk to managers and ask for an application, I'm told to apply online. If I call, or walk in, and say ""I've already applied and I'd like to set up an interview"" I'm told, ""there's no openings"" or ""we'll call you.""

Everything from McDonalds to (non-fast food) Restaurants, from Gamestop to (non-retail) corporations, from local shops to Home Depot shoot me down before I even get that first interview.

I've only ever held two jobs in my life and both were less than three months and for the same (out of state) company. Non-retail, unskilled labor. No college degree. No real intern experience. On the plus side: no drug history, no criminal history, good reputation with my two previous supervisors and experience working in hazardous environments, with a team and alone, and also working in an office on a computer.

I write cover letters and customize my resume to the job I'm currently applying to. I wear button-up shirts and khakis. I keep my hair cut short and clean. I shave, and bathe, and brush my teeth before I so much as walk into a business with intent to job seek.

I can do heavy lifting for hours on end. I can answer phones and deal with customers. I can even code in several languages, I just don't have anything to prove it with. I'm barely overweight anymore, and I don't look unhealthy. I'm a 22 year old Caucasian and American English is my only fluent language. I don't have anything obviously wrong with or unusual about me that I could see being selected against.

I set my schedule for ""Any time of day, any shift, any number of hours, any day of the week, will work holidays.""

I would literally scrub concrete with a toothbrush, starting at midnight, ten hours a week, below minimum wage (non-existent tip trick) and thank my boss for the opportunity. That's not a joke.

It won't be long before I lose my MassHealth, which I may need in order to survive, because I can't even afford a state ID. There isn't much I wouldn't do to make ends meet at this point.

If anyone can think of something I might be doing wrong, say so. I'm willing to try just about anything to get work.

* Working for DerpTech, a software house. My boss, the HR Director, pops his head around the door and asks if anyone computer savvy could figure out why his keyboard isn't working. I offer assistance and proceed to his office. He has a laptop with literally every USB port plugged into something, which is also plugged into a dock. I suggest he gets a USB hub so when he undocks he doesn't have to pull out a ton of cables, but he says it's fine. I examine the laptop. His USB keyboard is plugged into the ethernet socket. ""It was the only socket left,"" he declared, as I removed one of the other cables at random and plugged it in.

* A friend buys a new computer, and sets it all up. He turns it on, and it starts beeping, over and over and over. He calls me in. I look at the computer. Seems okay. The beeping is getting really annoying. We re-seat everything in the case, turn it back on, still beeping. The computer looks absolutely fine, but the beeping noise is really annoying us as we discuss what the problem could be. He suddenly grabs a pair of scissors and cuts the speaker cable. Silence. A few moments later I notice a second keyboard, upside down on the floor. I realise it is plugged in, as well as the keyboard on his desk. I turn it over so the keys aren't being mashed down. The computer boots.

* At school, my friends and I would often get into a fair amount of trouble. They usually had no IT staff, and the librarian would often manage the IT room adjoining the library with his very limited knowledge. We would always misbehave. One of my recent crimes, I created an 8mb version of C&amp;C that could be played networked, and sneaked it onto a couple of the computers. We were eventually caught, and told ""NO GAMES!"". It turned out that at the time, they had an intern tech support guy that they were trialling for a week. He was informed to remove the game from our machines (windows 98 machines). He does. The next day, none of the computers boot. It turns out that he'd done a Find Files for ""command"" and deleted command.com from every machine on the network.

TL;DR Get the right hole, flip it over, and execute the command."

Anyways, the producer who made the whole film happen knows the ins and outs of indie filmmaking and has done quite well for himself. I've managed to stay in touch with him in hopes of one day fulfilling his shoes.

Sample Questions:

How important is knowing the business behind forming a LLC and knowing legalities in the realm of producing?

Could you shed some light on financing and distribution?

How did you accumulate so many important filmmakers as friends, and then collaborate with them?

What are the steps in becoming a big time indie film producer?

That was a time when we both were in high school (she on her last year, and me on second last). After graduation she spent a year off and worked some and just took a break from school. When I graduated I worked for about 6 months and she began to study social studies (in another city, about 1 hour drive/train away). She commuted for about 2 months and after that we found an apartment in the new city. I still worked in the old city, but quit in the beginning of december and waited for school to begin (I started studying on the college on the spring). Since we moved here (now over 2 years ago) she has became more distant. In the beginning she felt home-sick and commuted home every weekend and after a year, she did it every other weekend. But after this time, when she had accepted that we had moved and we still had close to home and so fourth, she still was at the same distant.  
This last semester (since september of 12) she has had an internship in our old town (living at her mom's place) and have been coming here like 3 weekends a month. 
The problem: We dont have any spark it seems like. We both realize that this isnt working. She feel (we had a talk yesterday) that because of her education she has became more aware of surroundings and human life and have trouble figure out who *she* is. And all this distance have led to lack of intimacy (last time we had sex was at my birthday in the end of october, and before that in the middle of august) and she almost never initiate a hug or a kiss or just some cuddleing. 
During the talk last night we figured out that we have been stuck in doing nothing on the weekends, ever since she left for home in the beginning to now we dont *do* anything. Sure we have went to places together, but I mean on a more regularly basis. She feels that every time we have an argue (we have not yet had any really big fight where I have had to sleep on the couch or something like that) it piles up and psychologically stressful for her, she feels that the relationship (as it is now) only depletes her psyche.
Things that came up during the talk last night were things like 
* Moving apart to ""figure out ourselves""
This is the last week of her internship so she will be moving back here by the weekend probably. 
I really need some help/tips beacuse I don't know what I would do without this wonderful women I can call girlfriend!
**tl;dr** No spark between us, and she wonders if we need to move apart to figure out ourselves to be able to be back together again"

In the email, I just stated that I was in college, looking to go into Advertising, interested in the fashion industry and attached a portfolio of some ecommerce/design work I had done. This was in December, and they told me they were interested in meeting but since the holidays were coming up, to touch base in January if I hadn't heard back from them. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks, and I email them again to follow up. They told me to meet and talk at Starbucks at 2:30 today, no other details. The whole email interaction has been really casual (she uses smilies in emails for example) so I don't think the atmosphere of the interview will be too formal. Am I wrong for assuming this? I decided to wear an outfit that shows my personal style instead of something more businessy and formal, but now I don't know if I made the right call. The style of the fashion company leans towards vintage pieces and a bit of a grunge influence in my opinion. 

Anyone who has experience in the creative industry, can you tell me what to expect from this sort of meeting? Should I bring another copy of my resume? I honestly have no idea if this is gonna be just a super casual conversation type ""interview"" or if I will come off as too casual.

tl;dr: Interview with fashion company about potential internship at Starbucks. A tad clueless about what to expect and what to wear."

I've been reading probably an hour a day on average.  Got an awesome job from an unpaid internship which resulted in getting hired full time with an under market salary, but I got my foot in the door.  I know people look down on jobs like that, but with this internship/job and working my ass off I've managed to get past an interview with a technical recruiter.  I've been given the go ahead by HR and have an in-person interview coming up where we will likely discuss an app I coded for them last week.

I don't have a college degree, but if I'm lucky enough to land this job I'll have at least one free class a semester at a top 25 school in the US (the job position is with a cancer research crew at a university's cancer research facility), putting me in a great position for my career goals (heck the job sounds cool enough who knows, it has the potential to be the last company I work for!).

Moral of the story is you don't need a college degree to get a coding job.  It certainly helps and will possibly be required to move up in the field, but to get started and to land a job that will pay for school, it isn't required, plus if you work hard at something you have the opportunity to find out if you enjoy something before you've invested a few years and a couple thousand dollars.

Anyways, I haven't been offered the job yet, but I've certainly made it far enough to prove it's possible to get a high-end entry level job without going to college.

A little about where I'm at now, I just returned to college after a long break, my degree focus being Computer Science with a focus on math, and it's possible I'll go for a dual major depending on how things pan out. 

I'm a sophomore with credits, and currently use a 40 hour a week job to pay for my school with tuition reimbursement. Not having to pay a cent towards my undergrad education is a nice benefit but as you can imagine it may not be my best option. 

My current goal is to finish my undergrad in as little time as possible given my circumstances (40 hour a week job), which may be 3 more years minimum. I'm 26 years old and I think due to my makeup more than my age, I'm not someone who can continually sacrifice sleep without paying a heavy penalty for it, so to have enough time to study, decreasing my class load might be necessary. 


So this is a question more about life around schooling rather than specifics into schooling itself. Free education is awesome but I feel I'm at a disadvantage because there's no way I can do an internship which I would think is very important, unless I'm able to convince my work to let me intern a project. There's also limited time to do self education which I really would like to spend time on. 

I hope I'm not being too verbose in getting to the point. I know to go the PhD route, I need to begin focus now on working towards that goal, through study and gaining knowledge as much as I can outside of school. 

So how does a 26 year old that can't live at home, and is entirely dependent upon a full time job, pursue a PhD? Is this a path only suited for the really young/go getters that never missed a beat with education, or is strong determination a little later in life enough? 

You don't even really have to answer my specific question, this can just be a discussion about living the PhD life. "

It was really devastating then when I was not offered really even the possibility of a job at the end of the summer with my dream company, despite a stellar review.  Part of this, I think, is because my field, at least in industry, is shrinking.  After that rejection, I thought, ""I have made a huge mistake"" in picking this field.


I've been going to career fairs and scouting my school's job board, and it seems like for every job related to my field, or even in hardware in general, there are two, three, or more software jobs.  I've been programming since I was young, I minored in CS in grad school so I have a formal background in data structures, algorithms, and so on, and I constantly am writing tools in various languages to help analyze all of the data I have taken while in grad school.


Still, I'm realistic in that my software experience is just not impressive, especially for someone looking for graduate-level jobs, and I'm afraid the Ph.D and all the good science work is irrelevant or, worse, harmful when looking for software jobs.  My ideal job would be writing low-level software to control hardware, analyzing data coming from sensors, or something else that has a hardware component.  How do I convince employers to give me a chance?

Experiences making this kind of jump would be very helpful."

Together with a TL:DR story that explains the situation. ,[deleted],gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/16m3bd/reddit_gamers_im_a_21_year_old_teacher_and_i_need/,"Hello, and first of all thank you for taking the time reading this.

Let me first introduce myself. I'm Wolf_SF, a 21 year old teacher in mechanics, physics and technology. I have only been a teacher for one year, but that year was amazing.. But to make it complete, i need help: and i cannot do it alone

You see, i have alot of classes. One of the classes was not as ""normal"" at the others.
The pupils here come from a poor home. These children do not know what it is to be even a bit wealthy. They cannot afford school materials such as books( but these are rented to reduce the price),pens,... these are children that have 1 pen, and that's it. They aren't motivated to go to school because.. why should they? the teachers hate them because they aren't motivated, and they are hungry, they are bored,..

I have to teach them in technology. Being young i'm still pretty nervous standing before a group sometimes, but this class respects me. And i respect them.

Seeing how few they have, i gave them €500 ( i think that's about $600) of my own money so they could buy school materials of their own. You might be wondering:"" did they bought games, or shit?""

The answer, is no.

They all bought what they really needed, nothing more, nothing less.
A calculator, a 4 in 1 pen, a pencil, and many more..they were geared up, and they enjoyed school once again. Alot of teachers disliked me for that, but in the end i changed those pupils. They started to love school again.

Now,i often noticed that this class often goes to the computer lab. Right there i noticed they have one thing in common: gaming.

They do not have a high end PC, nor a playstation 3 or xbox 360. In fact, these children have only a computer at home which the school gave them because the computers were going to be trown away otherwise.

What games do they play? Halo 1 demo and SOF2 DH demo. I once held a LAN party with them, they are amazingly good in gaming as well :D ( and yes, they know teabagging )

Ever since i learned that, i have been trying to save money to buy games for them. Unfortunatly i am only an intern, and my contract was broken. From that moment i have been pretty deep shit myself, but that doesn't matter.

From day to day, i see those pupils again. They ask me when i'll come back, when we'll play again,..

I want to give them something, but i can't. And here's where my question comes up.

If you have any games that you don't play anymore, feel free to send them to me. I only have a steam account and a profile on origin. Since i live in Belgium, i'm not going to ask for shipping or transportation. I will distribute them and share them with the pupils once i have enough so they can all enjoy something new. I know the computers they have are able to run some games, but don't expect them to run Battlefield 3 or other high ended games on ultra.

I am joining all the PIF and giveaways that i can find to get a chance on winning games for them, i already have 1 ( ignite) :D

Anything goes, personally i don't know if these kids have a steam account on their own, i should check that when i see any of them again.


TL:DR I want to help poor kids have different games but i can't do it alone and i'm asking to share games you don't play or use.

Oh, and one last thing.

Thank you in advance for your help, **and please if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all**. If i notice this post gets downvoted and i'm getting hated on to oblivion i'm just going to delete it. Don't make this worse...

If you are interested, feel free to send me a PM. I should have a picture of the class somewhere, but after i had to move out of my appartement i can't remember (for now) where i put it. when i find it i will definatly add it.

Any other questions: feel free to ask them, but do it on a polite way. ( i do feel kind of guilty and nervous posting this)

Edit:right now i'm looking into some electronics, but i'm on my computer so i should be able to respond asap"

I recently learned that I was accepted for an internship in Omaha for the upcoming summer! I've been reading up on all of the ""Welcome to Omaha"" posts through the sidebar and I appreciate the fact that you set that up. 

One question I still had though was about public transportation in the city. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to bring a car, as I'm from VA and I can barely drive this Civic I have through the mountains over here. So I imagine there is some kind of bus system or something, but how is it? Is it paid? Is it safe? Is it reliable? Should I look for a different option? If I did find a car (or rental) to drive, how is traffic?

So yeah, if anyone knows this stuff it would be excellent. Also if you have any specific suggestions for a 21-year-old college student on the weekends and what to do and what to experience I'd love to hear it too!"

I have tried many times for jobs like this or at least internships. 

I am still a freshman pretty much. Now from my experience, I am kinda fed up with these ""wonder"" offers. I mean I get a lot of pretentious videos describing the ""awesome"" experience that you can have at their company. Now my reaction to that was extremely skeptical. I have worked a bit in the software development field and 
sometimes I get the feeling that these big software companies just send tons and tons of spam. They may have interesting opportunities but the crap that I have seen in their videos is amazing.

I mean I ran into a lot of problems where I work currently and there are a lot of challenges that normally I wouldn't even begin to imagine. But when I see these big software companies with their amazing promises and concepts I tend to laugh at them because they seem so unrealistic. I see mostly ""nice talk"" but not any conclusive information and nothing about programming. I am kinda fed up with these.

So after all that I have said above, is it still worth trying for that job? Did anyone go through experiences like mine? Any tips?  Should I put any more effort into it or just let it go to chance and write every crazzy idea that comes into my head onto that CV and in the answers?"

My Study Abroad transcript.


I would consider myself an outstanding applicant in almost every way.  A stellar GPA at a world-reknown university, great recommendations, an impressive set of internships and extracurriculars that directly reflect my desired field of study.  When I look back at this this, I think I'm as qualified as anyone to get in anywhere  But when I look back at my transcript from a Study Abroad program in France, I remember just how horribly my grades were during that year-long session of travel, parties, and friends.  At the time, I didn't really care about my grades, because I only had to pass to get full credit at my home university.  Now I see that grad schools want to see my study abroad transcript, and my confidence is just seeping away.  To make matters worse, many of the classes I took abroad relate to my graduate studies!  


On one hand, I think it looks cool that I was able to adapt to a new culture.  Hell, I even took most of my classes in a foreign language and got passing grades!  On the other hand, these grades were *barely* passing, and basically show what a lazy fuck I was in Europe.  For what it's worth, I got straight As when I came back to the states, so at least they know I didn't become stupid over there. 


What do you guys think?  Do you think the appeal of an applicant who has lived in a non-anglophone country outweighs the fact that he got poor grades while over there?  It'd be a shame if living France turned out to be a detriment to my applications.  "

Approval? Sympathy? My brief experience with Reddit tells me it is more likely that I'll get sarcastic, biting little remarks. But what the hell I don't have much to lose. 
Here's the deal. I was always a little fucked up even as a kid. My parents thought I might be retarded or something so I got tested and it turns out that no, I'm not in fact my IQ is in the 120s. Not genius territory but I aint dumb. (I don't want to bore you with the details but hey if I'm going to write this I'm going to write it for real.)
Ok. So I go on to do pretty well for myself and I get into college and whatnot. I was starting to think ""hey I might actually do ok, and all that depression and shit is in the past."" As it turns out that was an incredibly stupid thing to think because I had a major nervous breakdown last year and had to be hospitalized... blah blah blah you know the story woe is me. 
I could probably write an entire book about my breakdown but I will spare all of you good people. 
So now I'm living in China with my family. When I got out of the hospital I was determined to prove to myself and to the world that I was going to come back even stronger (A romantic notion, isn't it?) So I got myself an internship at a magazine in Beijing and picked out some new clothes because when you are a girl new clothes can mark a new era. Of course I couldn't get my act together and I kept having panic attacks and suicidal thoughts so they fired me. I don't care what my IQ is. I can't think like I used to. I can't hold down a job.
Last of all, I met a guy in Beijing who I loved. I mean REALLY loved. He was the real deal. I told him about my depression and he seemed to understand. Maybe I was a fool for getting involved in the first place, because he told me he was leaving China in a few months. But we talked about a long distance relationship (I've done them before, I know how to make them work.)
So I spill my soul to him. We sleep together a few times. Once we even do it in his office. Then he's not so interested anymore. He says we will be friends. Yet he won't respond to my emails. I want to hate him but I can't. I just feel miserable. 
I'm done. "

I eased off the ground and tried to stretch out my muscles which had been contorted painfully for the past 2 hours or so I had been laying in wait trying to hit leaves flying across the range at almost 1000 meters, the very edge of my M40’s effective range. I sigh and reach back for the box of ammunition we brought. 500 .308’s and not one left. Looking over at Earl slumped over unnaturally in the tattered green lawn chair. “Earl. Earl. EARL! It’s time to go, I’m out and you’re asleep!” I walk over to him and squat down “Earl? Are you ok? Hey, look at me!”

It was the first day of freshman year. I had two friends. Well it’s all past now; so to be realistic I had no friends. They were one-faceted friends, we formed a pack at school to fend off attacks but out of school we were lone wolves. I found companionship elsewhere, after my dad died in Afghanistan when I was 8, my mom finally finished her internships and got a job as a neurologist.  We moved into a big house with everything I could ever want, except a family, so I spent my time gaming. All of my time. The people online were my friends, my family, and I treated everyone else I met in kind. 

I was standing on the perfect white concrete curb looking over the perfect black asphalt road at the perfect brick houses dotting the road out for as far as I cared to look, waiting for the ugly bus to come and grind to a halt so it could drag me to yet another 8 hour interruption in my gaming. I was the only one waiting, not that it really mattered, day after day, year after year. Then, freshman year, things changed.

“Hey! Kid!” a graveled old voice striped my thoughts from their tracks; startling me, but I relaxed and made sure my shock didn’t show. 

“Yes?”

“When does your bus come?”

“Not for a while, Why?”

“Come help me move this.”

The command in his voice made my compliance almost instantaneous, almost. I looked up the driveway at him, a shorter robust man, he could defiantly do some damage.  For some reason I agreed. I was led around the back of his large garage to a small shed. Inside there was nothing much in the way of anything at all. But there was one thing that stood out, something I recognized very well from many hours of Battle Field 1; a BMW R12. Probably one of the most iconic motorcycles of WWII and there was a perfect one right in front of me. I lost all sense of where I was and who I was with and reached out to touch the seat.

“She’s a beauty, huh?”

“Oh. Um, yea. I just, well I haven’t ever seen one in person before”

“I got it in 1950, right after the third Reich fell and brought it here. I keep it 
running and tuned, but I’m just too old to ride it. Now come on, we need to move this rain barrel before you miss your bus.”

I didn’t forget that exchange, I probably never will. For the next few weeks I didn’t see that stock old man again, but every day I looked up at his house, I wondered if he was as alone as I was.

March 17, I was waiting for the bus when I head a stranger’s familiar voice.

“Hey! Kid!” So loud it was almost a roar I looked back up at that black brick house, so different from all the other perfect white picket fence, red brick houses dotting the landscape.

“Yes?”

“Come up here, youngblood.”

Annoyed, I decide, yet again to go help him out.

“Ok, but don’t call me youngblood, I’m in highschool”

“Kid, when you’re 81 years old, everyone is youngblood”

This time we walk past the shed and into the woods, about 40 feet in there is a large clearing with some construction equipment which appears to be digging a large hole.

“I’m not sure the construction guys would want us on their worksite” I argued
He doesn’t respond, he just lead me around tothe back of the excavator.

“Do you see that hydraulic hose under there? I’m too old to get under there and reconnect it, I need you to.”

“But there’s mud and stuff down there, I have to go to school in…”
The icy look of pure disregard took me by surprise, and I did what I was told. All was fine until I got out. I stood up, still clean as a whistle and adjusted my collar. Even as I did it, I knew that I had hydraulic fluid all over my hand and consequently all over my shirt now.

“I need to go change before I go to school”

“Well you had better get on that, your bus gets here in 2 minuets.”

“Shit!”

I didn’t make the bus, I changed in record time, but it was just an ugly yellow dot in the distance when I got back outside.

“Hey kid. You need a ride?”

“No... I can get my mom to come home give me a ride...”

“Na, you don’t need to bother your ma. Besides, I held you up, the least I can do is haul you to school. How old are you?”

“ Thanks. um, 15. Why?”

“Ah, Well you can’t drive then I suppose. Well follow me on up here.”
If I had been forced to call my mother for a ride to school because I missed the bus, I am fairly confident that I would have been skinned. He led me around to the side of the garage, pulled out an old brass key and opened the door. Once inside I quickly realised that there was only one car in this huge 4 stall garage, but about 20 motorcycles, all covered. He pulled the cover off of a bright red 1985 Porsche 944 turbo. At this point it just looked like an old sports car to me, I didn’t know there were only a few thousand left in the US, nor how much stupid power this one had. All I knew was it was old. 

“Hop in, it’s the only car I care to own.”

“Why?”

“Motorcycles, kid, motorcycles.”

In no time at all we were out of the driveway and out of the neighborhood. We rode in silence. There was no radio, no dash at all as it was. There was a speedometer, tachometer, fuel gage and boost gage and that is about the extent of the dash. The 5 point racing harnesses pinned me to the seat and the cold steel roll cage ominously hung above me. I didn’t see the purpose of any of this until we got on the rural highway that leads into town.

The harnesses that were so tight previously went slack with the amount of acceleration we pulled onto this road. The engine only growled in response, I dared to glance at the Jupiter sized speedometer, 135 and rising. The speed limit is 65, I couldn’t even think. We blasted past the bus in the oncoming lane like it was going to opposite direction on a highway.  Suddenly the town was almost upon us and he hit the brakes, actually, he slaughtered them. We decelerated smoothly and evenly but at an ungodly pace. It felt as though the racing harness I was wearing was going to tear me limb from limb. Then; suddenly, we were only going 30. We blended right in with the morning traffic amidst the minivans and family sedans.

“I haven’t done that in a long time.”

I didn’t respond, to this day I’m not sure there was a response in that situation. He didn’t say anything after that except to thank me for helping him out and bid me goodbye.

I got off the bus that afternoon and I wanted to go back. I wanted to talk to him, see those motorcycles that car... *knock* *knock* *knock* I waited *knock* and the garage door roared to life, it opened impossibly slow for the amount of sound it made. I just stood awkwardly by the front door with my hands in my pockets. Once open the old man stepped out and put out his hand for a handshake.

“I don’t think we have officially met yet, I’m Earl.”

“Oh, I’m um, I’m uh Mathew.”

“Well Mathew whadd’ya need?”

“I just wanted to see that car. It was pretty fast, what kind was it?”

Earl smiled kindly “ Sure, come on into the garage. She didn’t quite make it home after our escapade this morning, it’s been a long time since I have pushed her like that.”

“Oh, I’m sorry..”

“For what?! I haven’t had fun like that since the mid ‘90’s, she just couldn’t 
quite take that much abuse so soon.”

“Oh, Ok. What’s wrong? exactly?”

“I’m not quite sure, really. I lost oil pressure and coolant containment on the way back up this road here. ‘Be a head gasket or valve train seal, really ‘could be anything. I think I’m going to rebuild the whole drive line. I haven’t had a real project to work on for a long time.”

“How do you do that?”

That question brought about next 2 months of going to school and not looking forward to going home and gaming by myself, but to going home, changing into work clothes and going to Earls house. I would sit in french and write lists of things we had to do before we got the next part in and during physics I surfed Wikipedia, learning as much as I could about cars.  Within a week we had the entire drive train out and at the two month mark, he asked me something simple, but my answer changed my life.

Earl pulled his head out from the oil catch under the jugs and looked at me, I stopped wrestling with the valve spring I was trying desperately to get into the train and looked over at him.

“How abouts we go shooting?”

“Shooting?” I inquired

“Yah, take ma guns out to the backstop range over that big hill to the south and do some shootin.”

Even at this point I was still fairly skiddish about things so I asked “Is that even legal?”

“Does it matter?”

“I suppose not.”

“Well, then lets go! But clean your hands first, guns are expensive.”

After Earl grabbed a large black case from the garage, which he insisted that I not carry, we set off over the hill behind his house, away from the subdivisions, away from civilization. It was approximately a 15 minute walk to a large, natural ravine. On the side closest to us, there was a large dug out area and downrange about 1500m there was a immense backstop. Earl hauled the big black box off the small utility cart he was pulling up the hill and set it on the ground. He flipped open the latches and pulled out a tattered green chair. I would come to know that chair quite well over the next few years.
	Earl sat down and motioned to me while saying

“Alright kid,  pick your poison.”

Laid out under the first layer of foam in the box was a trove of guns, each with its own cut in the foam allowing it to stay securely in place. I grabbed the MP5, a stout but powerful 9mm submachine gun. I had never shot a real gun in my life, but at 15 years old I was not going to let that stop me. I picked it up, grabbed the box of ammunition underneath of it and fumbled a bit, finally getting the clip out and loaded. Earl just looked on in an interested but disconnected sort of way. Finally I got the clip filled and back in the gun, I looked downrange and found a tree to shoot at. 

I brought the gun to my shoulder and looked down the scope, I lined up the reticle with the tree, turned off the safety and pulled the trigger. 

“Nice shootin, Ace” I hear from behind me, I flip the safety back on and look at Earl who now has a sighting scope set up.

“When did you set that up?!”

“You were taking 100 years to line up, so I assumed you were trying to actually hit something and pulled out my sighting scope to confirm the shot, but all you did is prove you can hit a tree at 200m. Why don’t you just hand me my M40.”
I obliged him. He loaded a single round into the chamber, put the butt of the gun up to his shoulder and without ever even leaving his chair, he put a round downrange.

“What were you aiming for?”

Earl didn’t say anything, he just lined up the sighting scope and motioned for me to look through it. There was a metal plate that I hadn’t seen before and in the very center was a hole.

“Did you just do that? Sitting in your chair?”

“Yes.”

I came to find out that at one time, Earl was a sniper in the marines. As the months went by we worked on the 944 during the week and went shooting almost every weekend. I became a much better shot and the 944 really started to take shape. He gave me something I desired since I was 8.

I remember the day like it was yesterday. My 16th birthday, my mom was pulling a 36 hour shift at work, over my birthday. The real kicker was that it was a Saturday. All she had said was to pick a car that costed less than $10k and she would buy it for me. I was in no mood to look for cars and honestly just wanted to go shooting. I walked into the garage and saw the black covered car in the 4th stall. My dads car. I walked over to it slowly, I don’t know why we had never uncovered it before. I pull the cover aside and slowly reveled the body of a Laguna Seca blue 1998 BMW M3. The all black interior was perfect. The car had been my dad’s pride and joy, I don’t think my mother could have ever brought herself to sell it, no matter how little money we had.  It was that moment I knew what I wanted for my 16th birthday, I was going to take that $10k and turn this M3 into a street monster.

With this hair brained idea still fresh in my head I ran to Earls house and he met me at the door.

“What are you doing here? It’s your birthday, go be home with your mom.”

“She took a 36 hour shift. It ends tomorrow.”

“Oh” the transient pain in his voice was beyond obvious, it was almost tangible.

“Are you ok?” I inquired, concerned by this show of emotion I had never seen from him before.

“NO! I am not ok! I’m not your family, I’m just the old guy who lives down the street! This is a damn shame, a kid, alone on his birthday...” He would have gone on, but I cut him off.

“Earl! It’s ok, she gave me $10k to buy a car.”

“How does that make it ok?”

“Earl? Can we just ignore it and hang out here today? I have something you will be interested in.”

“Ok, but I aint happy about it.”

“Come on, I want to show you something.”

We walked to my house and I keyed the code into the keypad to open door number 4. The smooth aluminum door swiftly slid away, reveling my Dad’s M3.

“You already bought a car?”

“No, this used to be my Dads. The last time it ran was when we put it in this 
garage stall. 8 years ago. I want to use the money to rebuild the drive line and make it a street machine as a tribute to my dad.”

“And you want me to help?”

“I couldn’t do it on my own”

“I would be honored to help you remember your Dad.”

That is exactly what we did. It took about 6 months of work between working on the M3, finishing the 944 and shooting. There were days where I spent hours with a rag in one hand and degreaser in the other hand, trying to get all the grime out of the engine bay. Other days I sat with a sharpie and a box of ziplock bags, labeling every bolt. Then there were the days that made it all worth it, like the first time we flicked on the electrical system. Everything came to life without a hitch, the lights came on and the dash displayed all correct values. The day we finished the 944 is probably one of the most memorable days of my life.

Have any of you graduated early?  What did you do?  Travel?  Intern?

Also, no smoking indoors.

If interested (and you know you are!) 
you can message me on my reddit account, or you can email me at zutara1990@yahoo.com.

Thanks!

Edit: Personal Info Requested

* I usually work two jobs and will be graduating in May. I'm a Graphic Design major.
* One of my future roomies is a Studio major with two current internships. She can work with me at one of my jobs after graduation, but has enough experience in her field that a gallery job shouldn't be too hard to find. If it is, she will work pretty much anywhere as she likes to try learning new trades. If she has financial issues, her folks have her covered.
* Final roomie is super duper chill, has a job now, and will be graduating next December. She is also, a Graphic Design major.
* We all paint and do craft projects from time to time. 
* None of us are neat freaks. I generally keep a clean kitchen and bathroom, but my bedroom(wherever my work space is or my various projects happens to be) will not be organised. My future roommies bedrooms are rarely in order, too. None of us are gross. We don't let food rot around or anything. We just have a lot of art supplies and there is no point in putting them back where they go until the project is done. No crumbs. I clean crumbs.
* We all drink sometimes, but don't party too much. We go to parties. We don't throw them. Smoke weed if you want. That's cool. Just be smart. The landlord is very opposed.
* We all read a lot and share books. My own share of books is insane. I have a mini library going on. It is fair game for anyone in the house.
* None of us are vegetarians. If you are, that isn't a big deal. 
* Any religion is welcome. Just know that I am an atheist, and I don't think either of the other two roomies are religious either.

16ldwu,9,2013-01-14,Motivated by failure.,RunIntoTheForest,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/16ldwu/motivated_by_failure/,"For the first time in my life I think I failed a class. A class required to graduate. In grad school. And I'm not having a panic attack.

Because I tried. 

I was the good student who got A's and B's in high school and undergrad. I was always terrified of failure. I had never tried anything and failed. It was paralyzing. I would refrain from trying new things because I didn't want to know how weak I might really be. 

This time I stepped out into the great unknown. 

My wife left me for another man over the summer. My life was in shambles. I was sleeping on couches. I had dropped out of my courses. I was overweight. I considered dropping out of my program altogether. I almost gave up. 

In September I got a government internship in DC and decided to take the plunge into unknown waters and accept it. It was hard work. To keep from falling behind on my classes I had to arrange an independent study for a required course. I worked my ass off at the office. I had a two hour walk as a commute. I didn't have anyone I could confide in or rely on so I had to rely on myself. I worked harder than I ever have for 3 months straight. 

I had to register the class as incomplete when I didn't finish it on time. The professor, who was not thrilled with me taking the class as independent study in the first place, was less thrilled with me extending the timeline. I continued to work over break. I had to deal with my first Christmas unmarried. I continued to work. I spent time with my grandparents, which has gotten much more emotionally difficult as they have aged. I continued to work. I came back to school to sleep on couches again. I continued to work. My wife began to contact me with emotional pleas to ""be friends"" because she missed me. I wanted to curl up in a little ball and die. Instead, I continued to work.

My professor's emails got far less professional as I got closer to the deadline. His expectations were nearly impossible to understand in the first place and they became more confusing. When I thought I had until 23:59 Monday, he meant 23:59 Sunday. Monday morning, his way of reminding me was telling me I had until 18:00 that day (an extension). When I emailed him asking why the deadline had been moved forward he told me in an extremely unpleasant manner that it had been moved back. I worked as hard as I could to get all of the papers he asked for turned in. I was done by 17:00. 

He emailed me at 18:00 to tell me that I had never worked out scheduling a final exam with him and that now I lost the chance. The email had a mocking tone. I had forgotten about the final altogether (It's grad school! In social sciences! Who the hell does anything *other* than a final paper, let alone *in addition* to a final paper?!) I wanted to lose it. But I felt calm instead. 

I had failed, but more importantly I had tried. I had countless opportunities to give up. I could have given up when I was left alone. I could have given up when I didn't have a home to go to. I could have given up when I moved across the country to a life I didn't know. I could have given up when the work was overwhelming and I had no support from my professor. I could have given up with every pinch of salt on my wounded heart. 

But I kept going.

I made it to the end. It's not the end I intended, but I made it nonetheless. My transcript is doomed, but I have good experience on my side, new friends, old friends that are closer, I've lost 30 lbs, have lofty fitness goals for the new year (1000 lb club!) and haven't given up on school. I haven't given up on life. 

/r/GetMotivated always helped pick me up and get me going when I was at my lowest. This is quite a mighty wolf pack and I'm glad to have you as brothers and sisters. Keep fighting the good fight.

So I'm in the process of applying to internships &amp; jobs....


I'm a 21 year old female who is currently a senior at a 4 year University pursuing an Accounting degree. However before college I found myself at a crossroads between art school and university. Admittedly, I chose the University route and a shadow was consequently casted on my artistic side. Hours freely spent in Photoshop were quickly replaced by hours of spreadsheets in Excel. My beloved Canon Rebel Xti that I bought at 16, quickly began collecting dust. Fast forward three years and two major changes later (neurosci -&gt; acct)... my creative side has found a rebirth. I literally woke up one morning and found my passion reignited. All this has led me to seek out photographers in my metro area (MPLS/STP) to inquire if they if anyone has a need for any extra help. 
However, since my situation is unique, it has left me dumbfounded into how to present myself. 

I cringe at the thought of sounding cold, clueless, and characterless.
(Aka I'm am not a ""self proclaimed photographer"" with her SLR strictly switched on auto modes) 

So if anyone has any advice or tips to offer regarding contacting/ messaging them and sending them my resume, cover letter etc....I would most certainly appreciate it. :)

Sincerely,
a floundering college student

I wanted to let you know about the NASA Academy program. The NASA Academy is an intensive 10-week summer internship for highly motivated and successful undergraduate and graduate students.
Since its founding in 1993, the NASA Academy has brought together future leaders of the aerospace industry and exposed them to the inner workings of NASA, academia and industry. 

It was a really great experience for me and if you have an interest in space, robotics, propulsion, or aeronautics this program is for you. Hurry, the deadline is January 22nd.

It is not a typical internship program because you spend a lot of time travelling to different NASA centers and doing structured fun things with the rest of your academy, like skydiving and white water rafting. The friends I made there I still keep in touch with, and it has done wonders for my networking abilities. 

If you have any general questions about the program or about what I worked on ask away.

Application: https://www.academyapp.com/

EDIT: There are a lot more NASA internship opportunities that you can find here: https://intern.nasa.gov/solar/web/public/main/"

Bank arbetsgivare påstås hjälpt investerare att gömma pengar pass inkomster avdelningarnas myndigheterna genom att överföra det till Schweiz, säger Peter Lintz.Rapporterade undersökningen den 8 November 2012, sade Stuttgarter Nachrichten olagliga banköverföring som nått långt in 2012, pengar var osynligt flyttas via en intern clearingkonto på UBSS tyska filialen i Schweiz. Källa inte anges av papperet.
Elektroniska data och andra hundratusentals material som beslagtogs i UBS'S Frankfurt kontor som var razzia i maj analyseras för närvarande av Mannheim åklagare.
De rättsliga undersökningarna var avsedda för okänd företrädare för UBSS tysk division. Några av bankens kunder läggs bland mål, även Lintz.
Som ett resultat har schweiziska banker varit föremål för utredningar av skatteflykt i USA och Europa, kasta schweiziska banksekretessen, inskriven i republikens lagar och traditioner, i fara.
Bank vägrar att kommentera om frågan ganska sent onsdag samma år de mailade ett uttalande genom en talesman säger att banken redan ""samarbetar med myndigheterna"" men nekar till kommentar om pågående rättsliga förfaranden.
Ett antal franska kontor av UBS har sökt som en del av en sond till påstådda medhjälp av skatteflykt tidigare i år. I vissa andra frågor som berör UBS, de förnekar mediarapporter talar om rika tyskar att flytta medel till Singapore och andra pengar centers framåt av en schweizisk skatt itu av träda i kraft i januari.
Sedan 2009, UBS har noga undersökt ""villkor"" för företag med över 60 länder, däribland Tyskland och vidtagit åtgärder för att justera eller förbättra reglerna där så är nödvändigt, talesman sade.

I'm a high school senior from Wichita, KS. I've just recently sent in my application to Hampshire College, which is by far my top choice. I'm applying to other schools, but essentially they're all just back-ups if I don't get into Hampshire. I've heard opposing things on College Prowler, College Data, etc. about the ease of getting into Hampshire; some people saying that they look for only certain types of students, other people saying pretty much anyone can get in. I know the acceptance rate last year was 71%, but I have no idea where I fall among other applicants. So here is my info:

I got a 29 on the ACT. I play tennis, have a cashiering job, and work as a volunteer intern at a local museum (history is my interest). I started a recycling program at my middle school (thought that would appeal to the school's progressivism). I wrote a pretty good personal statement, sent a very good analysis essay over ""A Tale of Two Cities"", and got a great teacher rec. letter from my English teacher who knows me very well. AP &amp; Honors, all dat tasty stuff..BUT, my Achilles heel..I have a cumulative GPA of about 2.3 right now. There were things going on at home that distracted me from school a lot of sophomore and junior year, which I made sure to explain in my personal statement. However, last semester (fall of senior year) I got all A's which was great. I also made a video for the optional supplement of the application to show 'em I mean business.

So, you know my question: Do I have a shot? The notification is April 1st, but I'd like to get the opinion of someone at the school so I know how seriously I should apply for these back-ups.

Thanks very much, highly appreciated!

16l5iw,0,2013-01-14,Considering the CMA Exam,gmshaw,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/16l5iw/considering_the_cma_exam/,"I am going to be starting a career as an audit associate at a Big 4 firm at the end of this summer and will be finished with grad school and the CPA exams by the beginning of May.  I am considering studying for and taking the CMA exam during that down time because I eventually want to transition to some sort of managerial/accounting role in the brewing industry and I think a CMA certification would make me more marketable for that type of job.  I also don't have much else to do between graduation and work, so I figure it would be one of the best times to get the exam out of the way if I decide it's the right choice for that career path.

My only concern is how I will be perceived in the firm if I have completed both the CPA and CMA exams before I start working for them.  I have a friend who started a year ahead of me in the same office who said that if someone gets their CMA certification within their first couple years, people at that firm usually anticipate that person will leave within their first two years.  Personally, I am trying to avoid the mentality that I'm going to leave that early because I think it will cheapen the value I get from working there, but judging from my internship experience with them, I think it would be hard to convince me to stay if an incredible opportunity came up in the right place.  

I've looked into the exam process and it would definitely be significantly cheaper for me to take it now with the student prices in effect.  I don't have any doubts about passing the exam if I could take it now while I'm still in academic/study mode, but if I were to take it a few years down the road and be that far removed from school, I think I'd have a lot harder time motivating myself to study and succeeding on the exam.  At the same time, I don't want to be perceived by my colleagues/firm that I'm going to bolt after two years and have a target on my head the whole time because I've passed both exams this early.  Does anyone know if this is a reasonable concern or is it common for people to get those two certifications this early (aside from the experience requirements obviously)?  If this is a reasonable concern, is there a way I can try to avoid it from giving me that reputation and becoming a distraction around the firm?"

The thing is, I need a car. I'm currently working at a newspaper internship and it requires me to travel around my county.  So, with my mother’s help, I bought an old used car, using up my savings I had for the down payment.  

Normally, I use my student loans to help pay for my living expenses. I’m already 30k in debt (and I’m a sophomore) but I knew this was going to happen to me when I decided to go to college. I’m one of those unlucky middle-class kids who don’t appear to have ‘financial need’, therefore I don’t get much aid and I’m forced to take out a majority of tuition in student loans under my name. 

My disbursement date for the second half of my loan is at the end of the month. Until then, however, I have to make my rent, pay my car insurance and other bills, and pay my first car payment. This is totaling a little more then $900. 

It’s a lot of money, but I can’t ignore these expenses. So I sold my Xbox, the 3DS I got for Christmas, and some other little small things on Amazon, cutting the price down to about $500 (I was able to pay bills and car insurance!) and, sadly, I am not able to join the equestrian team at my university this semester (a club I became involved it while at school [I always wanted to ride horses!]). 

Again, I realize that this is still a considerable amount of money, and I hate to act so desperate, but if there is anyone out there who would be able to donate a few bucks, I would very much appreciate it. I’d also be happy with some loans as well; I can repay them come February. I’m going to try and pick up a second part-time job, since I’ve seen how nerve-wracking this situation can be, but I can’t just quit my internship. Journalism is all about experience and putting my foot in the door is key. So, I’m looking towards my future. I do have one Discover credit card, but I don’t want to go over my 500 spend limit (and I’m at about $495).

Thanks again. Once I don’t feel like I’m drowning so much, I’m more than willing to repay debits and spread help around.

I am however getting things back in order and now I am  able to go back there every two weeks to work on it for a couple days at a time. This is turning out to be very slow as you can imagine, since only my brother is working on the site when I am not there and he takes care of a lot of thing, but altough he can build just fine, he is not an expert. But enough of that!  

I was thinking that there might be interest in coming down and have sort of an internship in natural building in exchange for your hard work. You would probably stay at my family home with my mom and my brother and you would be able to eat whatever is available to eat. Or if you preffer you could make a camp site by the project. I would come every other week and stay 4 or 5 days with you and during that time you will learn everything you need to learn about cob. I will also teach you some other techniques like how to make adobe, wattle and daub etc. Only thing you need to do is work hard (there will be plenty of fun times as well, don worry) And pay your travel expenses and your beer. Anyway, I just came up with the idea, if there is any interest I can work on the details a bit. It would have to be anytime from now till april since in summer it just rains a lot. It would be good for you to get away from the winter blues in your northern lands.

I am 22 years old, no college education, I work as a server (so I make very little) and currently live in Toronto. I would ideally like to end up on a farm within 3 or 4 hours from the city.

I have long wanted to end up in the country and have a more self sufficient life and now I really want to start taking steps in that direction-- it's just difficult to figure out where to start, and I don't have anyone to turn to for advice.

My dream is to one day own a property and raise a modest income perhaps through dairy goat farming and making products from the milk. I would also be interested in perhaps a CSA... really I will do most anything to be able to live as much of a self sufficient lifestyle as possible.

I have looked into internships and apprenticeships with programs such as CRAFT, though my main concerns are by doing those I will not be able to keep working a paying job (which takes away from savings which will mean it will be even longer before I can realize my dream of my own property). Additionally, I don't yet have my drivers license-- so this will no doubt make things more difficult.

What should I do? Should I get the farming experience at the price of not being able to fluff my savings a little while longer? Should I keep working as I am and keep saving? I have no idea what to do next.

My lease on my apartment expires at the end of April, so I will be moving regardless. Though I would like to stay close to Toronto or Pickering, as my boyfriend lives there.

Anyway, thanks for reading this, if anyone was ever in a similar position feel free to write your story I'd love to read it...

16pav0,0,2013-01-16,Finishing undergrad in 3 years this year... looking for a one year MS to boost career prospect. Any recommendation? ,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/16pav0/finishing_undergrad_in_3_years_this_year_looking/,"Hi /r/GradSchool. First off I am going to admit that I am a quite frustrated college student so please excuse anything that comes out as downright foolish in my tone. I've been living in the US since middle school and I am still currently an international third year student at an Ivy. I really loved my first year here at my college and I was quite motivated. I came in wanting to do business and economics but I've always been very interested in the humanities so I took advantage of the liberal arts experience. However from the second year I guess I started trailing a bit due to a variety of social pressures plus my application for permanent residency in the US did not pan out as I expected (now I still have to wait a bit longer). Now I just really want a change of environment and leave this school. 

I've tried to look for internships but for my major in Economics it's very hard to compete for positions with other students, especially after having my grade dropping to noncompetitive level (barely a 3.6 right now). In addition being foreign is an instant turn off for a lot of the employers I've encountered, despite after having told them that they dont have to worry about sponsoring me for visa/green card in the future since I will get my green card in the next year or two. 
So right now I guess I'm kind of frustrated because all the friends I have (US students) have gone on to find great internships that paves a path to a good career while I am here struggling with immigration and multiple rejections. My grades were suffering a few terms ago but now I've at least got a hold of myself. I still worry a lot since I don't know what I'll do after graduation, at least before I get my green card.

The environment at my school is quite stuffy and limited so I really want to leave for some opportunity in a more urban/metropolitan town. I'll definitely keep trying to look for opportunities for the summer plus some nonprofit stuff. But I really don't want to return here for another academic year starting next fall. So I'm really looking at grad school since transferring is no longer an option plus I'm on track to graduate early. So in my mind it doesnt really hurt to get out of here by doing another year of school. Plus I'll have a legitimate reason for maintaining my visa status. Of course if I find employment that'd be optimal but grad school is definitely a great back up.

So I don't know what kind one-year masters program you can offer to boost my career prospect. So far my stats are 3.57 GPA (very likely 3.7 by graduation), a lot of clubs, some brief start-up experience, no research, one study abroad. I have high APs SATs and graduated top of the class in high school, but I'm not sure if any of this counts for grad school. Can get decent recommendations from humanities prof and I can network a bit this year to get recs from my math/econ profs. I think I'll go for a technical degree and I've looked at programs in stats, finance. I haven't really decided on a career, mostly because I equivocate a lot between my interest in humanities and quantitative abilities. I'd like to do stuff in humanities but I want to ensure my future security first. So I guess I don't mind working a corporate career first maybe return to teaching or writing in the future. 

Anyhow. Any recommendation for a program that still accepts application for fall programs would be appreciated. I'll try to take care of GRE soon. But any other advice for a young person from your perspective as a more experienced traveler in life is also very much welcomed.

Have a good day"

Pretty much I worked 4 hours a day doing the tasks I'd previously been doing as an intern, but since I was getting the hang of things it would take less time to do these and eventually I had a whole hour free.  I asked my boss if there was anything else I could be doing with my time, and he got really excited for a while about this new project he wanted me to work on.  He told me that if I wanted, I could come in for extra hours just to work on this project so I wouldn't feel pressured to do it during my normal work hours.  I bumped up my hours to 6 a day and for a while my boss really liked the idea about this new project.  Recently he has stopped giving me updates and things to work on for this new project, and even when I show him progress on things he asked for, he wont get back to me for a few days with something new to work on.  Basically I am right where I started and have EVEN MORE free time at work than before.  I feel guilty getting paid to basically just sit here, but since taking on the extra hours I've quit my other part time job (it was awful, this one pays more anyway, and I've budgeted to be able to work just one) and now I would hate to go back down to 4 hours and potentially have to get another job again.  My boss lately has been more ""we'll see where this goes"" instead of giving me anything to work on, and I am having trouble making things up for me to work on when in the past everything I have done for this project has gone nowhere, and I am the only one working on it (very small office).

I work as an intern for a large company doing data management. Now as an intern this means i basically copy-paste large amounts of information from a spreadsheet into the database; very tedious and boring work. I get two monitors to do this, so typically i will have the database on one, and my 2nd monitor split between whatever spreadsheet i am using and reddit/pandora/YouTube to keep me entertained. My boss is completely aware of this and has no problem with it. She does it all the time.    
    
So i have this very overweight coworker in the row of cubicals behind me. Not even in my department, but she is constantly over in our row to use our departments printer, because it's closer then hers. Even though each department is responsible for budgeting it's own paper and ink etc. Needless to say she's not popular round these parts.   
   
She likes to walk behind me and made snide comments under her breath about how ""we are paying our interns to watch YouTube"" and give me sarcastic ""Good Mornings"" to see if i minimize my window when i know someone is watching. (I don't). She's made reports to my manager and my managers manager about me plenty of times. Both ignore her for the most part because they are satisfied with the quality and speed of my work, so they don't care how it's getting done. But she is a massive annoyance to me.
  
**The Revenge**   
One day i just got fed up and decided to do something about this person. Luckily, the night before i had a delicious dinner with asparagus and broccoli, topped off with a protein shake. Anyone who's had protein shakes before knows, it can cause some...gastrointestinal distress. And asparagus/broccoli farts are noxious.   
   
So that day i made sure to walk past her cube on my way to the water fountain everytime i needed to let one rip and silently crop dusted the shit out of her all day. I later walked past two people in her department and overheard ""Is it just me or does Emily (the nosey co-worker [not her name]) smell like shit today"" ""No she totally does! It's VILE, dog shit smells better!""    
Victory is sweet.
   
**TL;DR:** Overweight coworker trys to report me for not doing my work, i respond by crop dusting her desk and her department blames it on her."
16ouno,3,2013-01-16,Not sure how to make it up to her...,8npls,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/16ouno/not_sure_how_to_make_it_up_to_her/,"So... I'm in Asia visiting my parents and I decide to get a random internship to pass the time. There's this girl at work whom I've taken a liking to, let's call her Jenny. She's been around since late November but she has a busy schedule, so most of the time we've spent together has just been breaks (dinner, lunch, random half hour breaks during shifts). I asked her out on a date in early December; she replied with uncertainty and told me she'd have to see after her schedule was confirmed. Her hours were approved a couple days after that but she never got back to me.

I was originally planning to fly back to Canada on the 27th, however some family issues arose and I have thus changed my flight to end of February. My workplace is fairly small, so most of the people I worked with knew about my situation. One of my coworkers actually really kindly set up a dinner for a small group of us on the 21st.

However, due to some miscommunication I figured it was just another typical ""work break group dinner"" and it turns out I wasn't scheduled to go in that day... on top of that, Jenny had seemed pretty hot/cold during the time period between my asking her out and this dinner being planned. I figured she'd lost interest and had been casually dating another girl on the side.

I do make it clear to everyone though that I'm uncertain about being able to show on the 21st; I tell them I'll be there if I get scheduled for work and that I'll send my regrets if not. Turns out I got the day off, the other girl asks me out for dinner that day anyhow so I say sure why not and on the 19th I tell them I won't be able to make it.

Around 6pm on the day Jenny calls me and asks if I'm showing up, I reply with my sincerest apologies that I don't have work today and thus will not be going to dinner with them.

Fast forward to today. My internship originally ended on the 24th of December since I was leaving, but I returned last week because I can't really sit around and do nothing. My reappearance in the office catches Jenny off guard a bit and on the first day she seems rather jovial and pleasantly surprised that I'm back... next day, however, she is completely cold towards me and just entirely ignores me.

OK, I'm kinda rambling on with this story so here's essentially what's going on: I know I really really fucked up on the 21st. I found out after the fact that I made a huge mistake assuming it was just a typical dinner when Jenny had actually taken off the remainder of her shift that day, arrived at work dressed up... and the ""group"" comment was just her being too shy to directly ask me out on a date.

Truth is, I do really really like her a lot but I don't want her to get emotionally attached or whatever since I'm leaving so soon. That said, I genuinely do believe I owe her an apology because what I did was extremely inconsiderate and just a major dick move.

My question is... how can I make it up to her? I was thinking of apologizing to her for being a sod and standing her up, then treating her to dinner... or should I get her a small gift/write a note (on top of apologizing in person of course)/other suggestions? I'm not really good at this kind of thing. I'm not expecting to get anything out of this by the way; I just want to repent for hurting Jenny's feelings because it definitely wasn't my intention to do that. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated, and sorry for the long post! Thanks guys :)

**TL;DR: Stood up a girl unintentionally, now that I know I fucked up how can I make it up to her?**"

With the start of the year, I've had a few interviews, and have ultimately been placed in somewhat of a dilemma:

I've been offered a three month, paid internship contract in an industry that I'm interested in, with the possibility of a job arising in the future - they're hiring three interns and one gets picked at the end. They want me to get back to them as soon as possible, and I would start on Monday.

At the same time, I've made it to the second round for a permanent role, also in a relevant industry. They offer great pay, however, the interview is only scheduled for next week.

I've asked the company with the internship role if there is any flexibility and explained the situation, but they want all of the new interns to start at the same time.

Just wondering if anyone can give any insight - money and job now, albeit temporarily, or something more lucrative, but not actually been offered to me yet?

16omi1,21,2013-01-16,How does Reddit feel about this?,varland,photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/16omi1/how_does_reddit_feel_about_this/,"My wife and I have been wedding photographers for about 5 years. We've shot somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 weddings together, and we really love it. I work during the week, and my wife is full time as a photographer. We sell packages as having two photographers. It's always the two of us, and we both have a lot of experience. We've both shot weddings alone and with/for other photographers.

I'm starting to see a trend in my area of wedding photographers who've been in business about two years asking for (and somehow getting) unpaid interns who want to learn how to be a wedding photographer. They're asking for anybody with passion and a (who knows what kind of) DSLR. The positions are unpaid, but you'll get a chance to accompany the photographer to weddings to be a second shooter and you'll ""get"" to help with editing and office tasks. These photographers aren't necessarily very good. I'm friends with some of them, and they consistently get 20 applications for interns every time they put out a note.

What really gets me is that since these photographers have an intern, they bill all of their packages as having two photographers. I've lost work to these people because the client has told me that we both offered two photographers but the other photographer is cheaper. Now don't get me wrong: if a client can't see the difference, then good riddance. I hope you're happy with wedding photos taken on a Rebel with a kit lens.

I just don't get what the appeal is. I know there are a lot of people with a DSLR who look at wedding photography and think it's easy money. After all, they have a camera that looks vaguely like mine, and I can make $5K in a weekend (in their eyes).

Is it just that people are so desperate to get into wedding photography that they'll whore themselves out for 6 months?"

After being a completely healthy person for the last 22 years, something is happening to me that is scaring me beyond my wits.
First a little backstory: I moved to a new area in September for a full time, paid internship at an advertising agency. Around the end of November they decided to keep me on staff with a pay raise and will be giving me a full time salaried position within the next few months if all goes well. WHen i found that out, I decided to move in with my girlfriend since we were in a LDR for the past year. I took off a week between xmas and new years to go home to see my family and we moved in to our new place the day after New Years. Which is when this all started.
I just feel completely out of it Reddit, like I'm walking through life in a zombie-like state. The worst of it happens about 30 minutes after I eat a meal, and during that time I'm just a mess. Heart palpitations, worry, feeling like I'm going crazy, etc.
Now I know it can't be a coincidence that this all is happening right when I moved in to a new place with the girl who i've never spent more than a week at a time with, but this doesn't seem to be going away so I'm worried. It's been an adjustment living with her but we're doing well and making it work.
My job is also very stressful as I feel like i constantly need to perform my best and never make a mistake so as to get the salaried position in a couple months. I can't stop thinking about things at work. My clients, projects, due dates, co workers, etc. I cannot leave work at the office and that on top of adjusting to living with my girlfriend is just driving me in a tailspin I think.
I'm just worried that it's something more than stress and bad anxiety. Although all the signs point to that.
Some other symptoms I'm experiencing includes random memory loss for little things every now and then, muscle twitches causing me to drop things randomly (just like keys when locking the door), and occasionally not being able to get a word out during a conversation. I hope this is all just caused because there is a million things going on in my mind but I want to be sure.
Also, the only time i don't really feel any of these things is when I'm working out at the gym.
Please advise, Reddit."
16ohth,4,2013-01-16,I just can't forgive myself...,cwes7675,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/16ohth/i_just_cant_forgive_myself/,"Hey reddit, I've been depressed for the past two years and have been struggling with feelings of shame, guilt and regret over an unhealthy mindset I had towards other people for the first three years of college.

I always was really bad at socializing, it used to take a lot of concentrations and coordination to talk to people and I would often freeze up and get anxious doing so. But instead of admitting to myself that I needed to improve my social skills going into college, I took pride in having hung out with sketchy bohemian types who smoked and did drugs and drank etc back in high school. They weren't even real friends, more like acquaintances that I clung to because I lacked a solid social life at the time.

Anyway, for the first three years of college I used the fact that I had connections with these people as an excuse to avoid social situations, I barely talked to anybody in my classes or dorms and just told myself that they weren't as cool or mature or open minded as the bums I hung out with back in high school. The few people I did talk to, well, they all eventually thought I was weird awkward or creepy.

I used this stupid excuse to avoid so many social situations and feel confident at the same time, and it wasn't until an extremely lonely and stressful time during senior year that I realized I was a socially awkward loner using this dumb excuse to feel better about myself even though I knew deep down anybody I came across was going to find me weird or off putting.

Now it's been a year since I graduated, two years since I began to realize the error of what I was doing. I'm much much better at talking to an mingling with people now, as well as more accepting of other peoples backgrounds and personalities so as not to judge them or feel superior towards any other person.

But the thing is, I regret it so damn much. In retrospect it was such a stupid thing to do. I'm still so bitter over having been so close minded and immature going into college. 

Any way I look at my past, I fucked up the biggest and last chance I had to socialize before entering the real world. It tears me up I think about all the friends and social opportunities I missed out on because I wasn't more honest with myself and was afraid of admitting to myself I sucked at socializing at the time. This is all I ever think about every second of every day. 

I can't focus on studying for the GRE to go to grad school. I got fired from two engineering internships because I couldn't stop rehashing my lack of college experience so I got fired from both internships. I'm about to get fired from a pizza place I'm scraping by at currently, cause of all the damn mistakes I'm making. I feel so low and guilty over using such a stupid an shallow reason to have preserved my ego back in college. Even though I worked hard to practice socializing since I graduated my social skills mean nothing now that I'm out of college and I have to drive very where just to meet up with one or two people to do something low key. I'm lost in woulda coulda shouldas. Now, my college experience wasn't a total loss. I managed to have a different girlfriend for each of those first three years, even though they were all slightly crazy and didn't have any friends much like me at the time. I was content with them, late nights sipping coffee and biking around campus. Still, I feel so low for just not talking to all the students around me over such a dumb reason I invented.

TLDR: How do I forgive myself for having thrown away the entire social aspect of college over some idiotic elitist attitude towards other people? For waiting until the end of college to realize I sucked at socializing an make an effort to improve at it?"

I've got a tricky situation on my hands, and would love any advice I can get. At the moment, I'm very fortunate to be enrolled at a great school studying Computer Science with a solid GPA. Beyond that, however, my experience here has been nothing like what I had thought it would be upon entering, and not in a good way. I'll explain the situation as briefly as I can, then ask my question.

I initially entered college around seven years ago as a freshman, but not long after that I began to be dealt a tough hand of cards which ultimately forced me to take around three years away from school, and beyond that some time as only a part-time student. To make a very long story short, I had three friends die -- two by suicide -- within a span of just a few months. I initially took a medical leave to deal with this, and intended to be gone only for a short time. Shortly thereafter, however, my father's Parkinson's became so severe that he had to stop working and I, being home already, became the de facto caretaker (my parental situation is a bit irregular -- they were actually in their 50's when they had me). Our financial security was never good, but it got a lot worse after that and due to a few other factors I ended up staying out of school much longer to help manage his care. Though to be honest, I had become so depressed at that point that it wouldn't have been wise to return to school anyway. The situation with my father has been resolved, so to speak, and I have since returned to school to continue my degree.

As you may have guessed, I would like to know how I should best address my massive enrollment gap and lack of internship experience with companies during a job search. ""I took a medical leave"" or ""Family issues"" seem so cryptic and would probably only engender confusion. However, telling any considerable fraction of the full story would seem like suicide in a job interview. That said, I'd really like to be as truthful and honest as possible. I'm not going to back down, but I am extremely self-conscious about it and have been struggling to address all this to people in both a reasonable and truthful way.

Everything aside, I believe that I have the core software engineering and algorithms knowledge to do well at a reptuable company -- Palantir and Google are far and away my top choices (a man can dream, can't he?), but I'd certainly be happy with many other options as well. I'll be looking for full-time opportunities next year most likely, but am currently focused on finding a solid internship for this summer.

Thanks again for reading, and best of luck to all of you this job season --

16odfx,4,2013-01-16,"A note I wrote concerning questions about children I've been getting lately, though it fit in here.",SamiLMS1,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/16odfx/a_note_i_wrote_concerning_questions_about/,"I was motivated to write this after receiving many questions from people lately. This is because people know I'm childfree but seemed confused when I bonded strongly with my friend's nine month old and started an internship working with abused/neglected children. This is my response.

I felt the need to write this to clear the air surrounding some questions I’ve been getting lately. My bond with Jocelynne and my choice of internship, which I thoroughly enjoy, has caused some people some confusion due to my childfree status. Fair enough. 

For this to make sense I need to give some background on my views about societal obligations. I believe our society can be too individualistic at times. I understand I am not perfect and make individualistic decisions at times too. Of course at some level we must be individualistic for the sake of survival and these behaviors are expected considering the values of our society. I have two very strong beliefs that many of my life decisions stem from. The first is that love is invaluable, precious, and the core of the human experience. The second is that we have obligations to help our fellow humans and should live our lives in ways that better society for as a whole. I’ve been called naïve, overly romantic, and idealistic for feeling this way but that is okay – if that is the worst thing you can say about me I’ll feel pretty good about myself. 

It is no surprise to anybody I don’t want my own children, I’ve been very open about that for the past ten years now. The misconception that this equals some sort of hate towards children is understandable and partially my own fault. People aren’t always kind when you make a decision that goes against the norm. Hate and indifference are defense, they are the only things I’ve found to make people stop persistently attacking this decision. As I type it now it seems somewhat juvenile but the fact of the matter is it was – when I made the decision to use that defense I was a teenager angry at always being told I was wrong. It was bad enough people told me I was unnatural because I’m a lesbian and would change my mind about that, but then to have people tell me my decisions regarding children were wrong too was more than I wanted to deal with. 

Here are at the facts – I’m not the gush over kids type. I’m not the type who feels all warm inside when a baby laughs or thinks tiny shoes are somehow any different than adult shoes. The first time I met Jocelynne it wasn’t a total rush of hormonal love and maternal adoration. I love Jocelynne because I have spent time with her, cared for her, and bonded with her. It is the same sort of love I have developed for my friends who I care deeply for. There was no instant maternal instinct involved in it for me – the protective instincts did not develop for me until the caring did and it is the same protective instinct I have for my girlfriend or my cat. Part of why I was able to bond with Jocelynne is because she has a wonderful mother who completely understands my decision to have children and never forced Jocelynne on me. She gave me space to learn about her on my own time and interact with her as much or little as I felt comfortable. Because of that I almost never want to put her down. The kids I have met at my internship are some of the best kids I have met but again it was a process, I got to know them as individuals and spent time with them that led to bonds. It was not caring for the sake of them being kids, it was caring because they were people I got to know and spent time with. I thoroughly appreciate the time I get to spend with them and have learned a lot from them. But none of this has changed my beliefs about having my own children and I do not think these experiences clash with my beliefs at all. 

Let me return to my second belief for a moment, my belief that we need to help each other. Part of the reason we work as a society is because we all choose different jobs that fit different needs in society. We need doctors, teachers, construction works, police officers, firefighters, cashiers, cooks, and many others for the society we have created to run smoothly. For our society to continue we need children and we need people to care for those children. For a multitude of reasons the people who care for these children cannot always be the parents. Some parents are unequipped, some are harmful to their children and some end up leaving this earth much earlier than planned. That is the point in which others need to step in, people who possess no genetic bonds but still care about these children because they are people and a part of our society.  I have always been drawn to that role and honestly think I can contribute to society in a meaningful way. I don’t know if I believe in fate or destiny but I know this is something I have always been drawn to. I want to help people, to spread compassion, to heal people’s hearts to the best of my ability. 

I have been told I will never know a child’s love if I don’t have my own children. I am perfectly fine with never feeling the love of a child with my own DNA. When I walk into the room and Jocelynne looks at me with those happy eyes and arms outstretched I know she loves me. When the kids at my internship get excited to see me and ask me to play games with them I know they appreciate my company. That is enough for me. I believe the needs of those who lack love in their life is worth giving up one part of love in my life. And yes, I know having both is possible, but I’d rather not split my efforts. I cannot justify creating another human that would take my time and energy when I could use that time and energy for so many others who need it more. My life already has so much love in it. I have the love of my parents, of my beautiful girlfriend, my friends, Jocelynne, and many more. I have learned so many different types of love in my life, I am so blessed already. I am okay with missing out on one. I understand to some people this is the greatest love in their life but it won’t be in mine and that doesn’t make the love I have any less special or meaningful. 

My attachment to Jocelynne is not typical, and if you were to ask me why she is different I couldn’t offer much of a logical answer. I have many friends who have kids who I have not felt the same bond with. Perhaps it is the long-standing friendship with her mother, perhaps it is her mother’s acceptance of me as a person or maybe Jocelynne and I just have personalities that mesh well. I feel like people forget that babies are people and have their own personalities just like adults and sometimes personalities just do or don’t click really well. I do love Jocelynne, I love watching her progress and would be absolutely heartbroken if something would happen to her. I am grateful she is in my life. But I am also grateful she is not mine. I feel zero desire to have a little version of her all my own. 

I won’t discount the fact that more than a few of my other reasons for not wanting children are selfish. I think that is normal though, I think even parents who have unselfish reasons to have children also have a long list of reasons that begin with “I want”. I feel that if it meets my personal wants and benefits others at the same time it is win-win. I’ve been called selfish many times, and I’m sure I will be many more times before I do, but I can handle it. The older I become the more I realize it doesn’t matter if someone thinks I’m making the wrong choice, being selfish, or will change my mind. I don’t think I need to justify it either. Many of justifications are very private, sensitive information and I don’t think they are anyone’s business but mine and my love’s. 

There is not an ounce of doubt in my heart that my life decisions are right for me. There are some who do not understand this and are even disappointed by it. I’m not sure what more I can say about that except that I believe we can respect each other without understanding each other. I do believe we can co-exist and be happy and respect each other’s contributions to society’s future. I’m writing this in hopes of some peace and understanding, for an end to the forcing another way of life on each other and instead appreciating the people who have chosen to do different than us. If we all had the same passions and desires in life we would have more problems than solutions.

But new and stressful things- like job searching- are just terrible. I just sent in an application to be a phone fundraiser for my school and I'm kind of flipping out because I only have one real reference who I asked a long time ago and who I'm not sure remembers me, same for past employers (I have no real job experience) and all my previous job searches have failed.

I was on the verge of tears filling out that app because it just seems so terrible to me and it nearly took me covering my eyes and looking away to hit ""send.""

I also hate job searching because I need to be picky- I have no car, so far from campus is not applicable. I have a semi-long distance boyfriend who I only get to see on weekends and not being able to visit him would just ruin me, so I can't really apply for something that requires lots of weekend time. Most everything left is either Federal Work Study, which I don't qualify for, or an internship when I need money!

It often feels like no one will ever hire me. Hell, they haven't bothered before. I send out app after app and hear nothing back and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong!

I'm a college senior majoring in Sociology. I have a 2.7 gpa. I've changed my major 3 times and I decided on Sociology because I love learning about society and people, which is what most sociology majors love to learn about as well. 

I do plan to get a Masters. I plan on going to my current college and doing masters there. I want to get into Market Research or Non-Profit/Social Marketing. I also have an interest in Women's Rights/Issues. 

Here is the problem. I have NO experience in my field at all. I only had one job in my life and that was dealing with food and coffee. Since I changed my major many times, I wasn't able to get an internship. So at the moment, I'm looking into that and volunteering.

Sadly, some of these places want experience and I have none. I don't know where to start. If I ultimately want a career in Market Research or Social Marketing, where could I start? If it helps, I live in NYC. 

So far, I applied for volunteer positions in Non-Profit organizations to at least get my foot in the door. I also have joined Meetup groups for non-profits and Women's Organizations/Human Rights such as NOW and Amnesty International. 

Any advice would be appreciated. And no, I will not change my major. 

EDIT

I DO NOT want a career in Social Work and that is not the reason why I went into Sociology in the first place so please don't suggest I go into Social Work. I specifically want a career in Market Research or Social Marketing in non-profit sector. "

I am looking for some advice. My career goal is to work as a policy analyst in a certain field. I already have a B.A. in Political Science and I have been accepted into a masters program at a local university for public administration. 

There is a think tank here in town that works in policy research in the same field that I want to work in. A while back, they posted a job announcement that I applied for, but did not get. As I looked through their staff to see what the kind of average credentials were, I noticed that a couple of the staff members were going to school in the same graduate program that I have been accepted into, but were still what appears to be paid staff, not interns. 

That is pretty much my dream scenario for continuing ahead. I know I need at least a masters to continue in the field, but if I could resume worthy experience, that would be so much better. I was thinking about emailing HR with this same story and sending them my resume again, and then ask them what kind of qualifications I would need to work and go to school, and maybe see if they know anyone who would be willing to talk to me and give me career advice. 

I am worried about it not being phrased right and sounding weird. Another fear I have is that by being too forward, I might ruin an actual chance later on while I am in school.

Has anyone else been in this position or have advice?

Thanks!"

16ns5i,1,2013-01-15,[24/F] In a long term abusive relationship with [26/M]. Cannot leave him after years of physical and emotional fighting. ,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16ns5i/24f_in_a_long_term_abusive_relationship_with_26m/,"Excruciatingly long story, and will try my best to keep this as short as possible.

Me and the boyfriend have been dating for 4 years. Things were amazing for 3; travelled the world together, lived together for most of the relationship, completely head over heels in love. 
I knew getting involved with him that he had a very intense personality (history of drugs and violence, extreme temper), but he is still to this day the most charismatic, charming man i have ever known. 
This year was a whirlwind. We moved to Hong Kong, I was to model and he was to intern at a bank. He ended up getting ''drugged'' with something one night we went out, and got angry that I was speaking to another man. He then punched me in the nose and was arrested for fist fighting in the streets of the club district. I broke it off, but one thing led to another and I eventually took him back. Things were horrible afterwards. He then quit his bank job and got a job as a club promoter; he was constantly flirting with gorgeous women and ignoring me all night, which led me to drink way too much and horrible physical fights between us, and always ended up with me crawling back to him no matter what he did to me. A couple months into this I completely went mental, cut my work contract and booked a flight home the next day. When he found out I was leaving, he told me he couldn't be with me anymore and that he was in love with someone else (that I called him out on previously but he denied it). 

As soon as I got off the plane I was hospitalised for being suicidal, depressed, etc. I had no idea how to live without him, and felt extremely unwanted. We were still speaking to each other every day, and even though we weren't together, we would Skype sex and act like we were. Total mind fuck. I told him to make a decision with whom he wanted to be with, and he couldn't. I went along with it, doing whatever he wanted and going out of my way for him. He was supposed to come home to visit in September, but got arrested at the airport for trying to leave Hong Kong after the whole fist fight/drugged night went down. After he got out of jail the second time, he told me he officially wanted to be with me. I obviously was ecstatic and accepted. We spoke twice a day, every day, and I put complete trust in him. Ever since then, I have been in intense therapy and have been trying to heal. On the other hand, he has been going out every night until six in the morning doing drugs and drinking like a fish. He sees no problem in this considering it's his ''job''. 

After 6 months, he finally comes home last week, to be visiting until he goes back at the end of January. I thought everything was going to be perfect.. Unfortunately, this is what has been happening:
He seems completely emotionally disconnected and distracted. At first I blamed it on the jet lag. We go out for a couple drinks and obviously go home and fuck. The next morning he is engrossed in his video games and reddit, won't pay any attention to me whatsoever. I get upset, and he tells me I'm too needy and I should just leave. That my emotions are complete bullshit (which he always says) and that I need to grow up. We sort of make up and he promises to have a day with me tomorrow. He doesn't call me and I can't get ahold of him until midnight, and says he will see me when it's convenient, that he's sorry for ignoring me. We meet up and do coke, I can't sleep and I figured that he must be cheating on me. I find a whole Skype conversation with this other woman that had been going on for weeks. Telling her he missed her so much, how he wishes she was here, etc. I confront him and he admits to crushing on her and watching movies and cuddling, but never having done anything because he has self control. That I was making a bigger deal about this than there actually was. His excuse was that I was being a bad girlfriend and that he didn't feel the need to tell me since nothing happened between them. After telling me this he gets angry that I woke him up, chokes me and throws me off the bed. Once again, I forgave him. I leave and he, once again, promises me he will call me that night. He doesn't. I finally call him the next day and he tells me I'm so annoying for calling him because he has a stomach ache and hangs up on me. He knew that I had a very important therapy session that he was supposed to be a part of that day, but did not even remember. He is also leaving back to Hong Kong in less than a week and I feel like he does not make any effort to see me. 

I wanted to ask Reddit's advice, as I was planning on moving there after my therapy is over. I feel he knows he can treat me like shit, and although I do realise this, I am so scared to leave him. I have abandonment issues and have also invested 4 years into this relationship. I do not feel valued or appreciated whatsoever, but I'm scared to think it's all my fault somehow, and that if I only got better then everything would resolve itself. Any advice would be so dear to me. 

TL;DR Boyfriend of 4 years moved to Hong Kong to be a model club promoter, he comes home after 6 months long distance and treats me like absolute shit and physically hurts me. Found evidence of other women, denies it as being important since he only had a ''crush'' on them and has self control. Cannot find the strength to leave him, wondering if I am the problem.

My work as an archaeologist takes me to England (so far, could be), where I'm a supervisor on a dig in the country. 

As I'm up in a tree taking pictures to record the day's work(we do this a lot), I notice a striking dark-haired man coming over the hill. He approaches and starts questionning the interns working on the dig (all males of course) and looking around. They point to me, and he comes under my tree and then I realize : it's HIM. GOD.

So I fall down on him, and we laugh it off. I play it cool and non-crazy (not very likely but eh) and he explains that they are filming for Sherlock right next to the dig. 

I then proceed to show him around the place, looking beautiful (albeit dirty), and very brilliant and stuff, explaining 1000 years old remains in the sunset as the interns take the cue and leave.

Over the course of the week, we meet up at the village pub where I once again look like an awesome scientific coming down from my Landrover. 

He is really glad to see me. I tell him I'm off to London next week, and at some point he goes ''It's terrible that you haven't tasted a proper curry from London'' and IT'S A DATE, ladies ! 

And then we go on a few dates, where he realizes that I'm the only one for him. I meet the parents, who really approve of me despite the slight age difference (I'm 13 years his junior). He proposes right there in his parent's garden, and there are fairy lights. 

And then mini-Bens running aroung the house."

After being a completely healthy person for the last 22 years, something is happening to me that is scaring me beyond my wits.

First a little backstory:  I moved to a new area in September for a full time, paid internship at an advertising agency.  Around the end of November they decided to keep me on staff with a pay raise and will be giving me a full time salaried position within the next few months if all goes well.  WHen i found that out, I decided to move in with my girlfriend since we were in a LDR for the past year.  I took off a week between xmas and new years to go home to see my family and we moved in to our new place the day after New Years. Which is when this all started. 

I just feel completely out of it Reddit, like I'm walking through life in a zombie-like state.  The worst of it happens about 30 minutes after I eat a meal, and during that time I'm just a mess.  Heart palpitations, worry, feeling like I'm going crazy, etc.  

Now I know it can't be a coincidence that this all is happening right when I moved in to a new place with the girl who i've never spent more than a week at a time with, but this doesn't seem to be going away so I'm worried.  It's been an adjustment living with her but we're doing well and making it work.  

My job is also very stressful as I feel like i constantly need to perform my best and never make a mistake so as to get the salaried position in a couple months.  I can't stop thinking about things at work.  My clients, projects, due dates, co workers, etc.  I cannot leave work at the office and that on top of adjusting to living with my girlfriend is just driving me in a tailspin I think.

I'm just worried that it's something more than stress and bad anxiety.  Although all the signs point to that.

Some other symptoms I'm experiencing includes random memory loss for little things every now and then, muscle twitches causing me to drop things randomly (just like keys when locking the door), and occasionally not being able to get a word out during a conversation.  I hope this is all just caused because there is a million things going on in my mind but I want to be sure.

Also, the only time i don't really feel any of these things is when I'm working out at the gym.

Please advise, Reddit.

I'm happy that they accepted me since unlike most developers I don't have a CS degree. The problem is the company is brand new, does not have investors yet, and the internship is unpaid (this would be fine if they weren't asking 20-40 hours a week). I feel like I can wait and find a better offer but this is based on my own instinct and not the reality of a web developer finding a job. 

My experience includes programming non-stop for the past 8 months, 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, along with numerous projects under my belt using Rails/Sinatra/NoSQL, etc etc. My question is, should this be something I'm grateful to take or should I find something else, at least one paid."

 Your friendly neighbourhood Canadian here. I was in India for five weeks in May/June, and I plan on going back in May, 2014 for an internship. I will be there for four or five months, and this time, I won't be surrounded by classmates and professors. I will be completely alone the whole time. I was sexually assaulted in Goa, and I am hoping to not go through that again when I return to India.

 I have a few questions. Are people around to carry a knife for protection, or will they get in trouble for having a concealed weapon? What about pepper spray? Ladies, do you carry anything like this to protect yourselves? 

 Call me paranoid, but the assault experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth. I know the obvious steps to protect myself, like not to dress provocatively, not go out alone when it's dark, etc, but things happen in the middle of the day, to girls who aren't dressed like Western hookers. 
 
 Any insight would be really helpful. I appreciate it. 

  Thank you!"

Entering college I was hoping to have everything I'd need to know by this point, but right now I'm feeling hopeless.

I can program, I know that much. I know C++ and Java, and have been able to jump into other languages (C#, javascript, for example) easily. More complex things take a bit of time, but eventually after a lot of googling and tinkering I get it right.

Other than that though, I'm clueless. Despite taking hardware classes and other ""inner-workings"" courses, I still don't know much about computer specs. When my friends talk about their newest computers with their fancy parts, I just nod my head without really understanding. While others are making their own laptops, I don't even know how to make my own PC. I want to blame the Russian teacher, or the teacher with tenure who didn't really care, or the teacher who read the book word-for-word and eventually switched to a youtube tutorial to teach, but I know that most of my struggling is my own doing.

I have nothing to show for a portfolio. I have a Unity project that I've been toying with for a few months, but I haven't had much time to work on it and have only gotten a few simple functions on it (Creating stats for a player and enemy, and a functioning attack button). I did take a class, a game design course, where the entire class made a game together but the dropbox has already been deleted and no copies exist.

I want to get into the game industry so bad but I'm just at a loss of what to do or how to help myself. I'm afraid of letting people know that I only feel confident in programming and that everything else makes my head spin. I've applied for an internship with EA, and someone who worked there has agreed to put in a good word for me, but I'm afraid that if they accept me and I go that I'll just make a fool of myself. My university recently had a CS&amp;IS dept pizza party, and I had mentioned that one of their recommendations was to know multi-threaded processing and how I didn't have any experience in that as far as I knew. A kid overheard and said that if I didn't know that, then I had no business in EA. My confidence has reached an all-time low.

I feel like I'm just begging for ""Cheer up, it's ok!""s or that this is one of a billion similar posts, or if this is even in the right sub, but I really need advice, or direction, or something that could get me out of this horrifying rut. What can I do to help better prepare myself for what's out there?"

* You will provide vital support to end-users across the country by answering the support hotline, reviewing user requests and responding to automated alerts

* Also, you will monitor workstation builds, install/update software, and maintain documentation in an issue tracking database

* This position is geared towards individuals with 0-4 years of experience out of the financial services realm; a bachelors degree in some sort of technology field is required (not my rule, my clients!)

* Recent graduates will be considered but you must have strong internship experience (in financial/technology) and a solid academic background (need a solid GPA from a good school)

* You must have excellent communication skills - written and verbal 

* Technical requirements: troubleshooting desktop/mobile hardware and software including Windows and Linux (must have experience with both) 

* Must have experience working with Microsoft Office, Microsoft Exchange, Active Directory, and VPNs (if you've worked with Sharepoint and/or any related financial software that would be great!)

If you feel like you're a fit, please message me and we can discuss in greater detail. I also have an opportunity with the same company but it's a leadership position ~ tech support team lead; must have experience with the same technologies as above but in a leadership position, 5-7 years of experience out of the financial realm.

I graduated from a small Midwest school in 2009 with a degree in Finance and a 3.25 GPA. During my time in school I started playing poker online and was able to support myself throughout college. Given the money I was making and the nature of the job market at the time, I decided to keep playing poker after I graduated. In 2011 the government shut down online poker and I eventually I quit playing as I wanted a more stable, long term career. I spent all of 2012 looking for a finance job. A few months ago I was offered a job but it ended up falling through.

After some research I've given serious consideration to becoming an actuary. I love quantitative problem solving (which was why I fell in love with poker) and feel like this field would be something that would satisfy that. I was hoping to get some advice specific to my unique situation.

Some of my main concerns are:

1) Would I be employable given my background? I have no corporate experience at the moment and didn't intern during college. Would passing the first two exams still get me chances for interviews? 

2) I don't have an extremely math heavy background. I took Calc 1 in college and a couple of Stat classes and that's basically it. I've been reviewing calculus in my spare time and its coming back to me fairly easily but I'm concerned about teaching myself some more advanced topics.

If 1) and 2) are possible what would be an approximate time frame to pass P1? Would early May be feasible?

I have a hard time telling stories without giving the play by play.

So today, I had gone up to the elementary school where my mom teaches, offering to help with computer-related issues. For background, I worked for this school district's technology department as an intern for my final semester of high school and four summers. This is just to say I know their setup pretty well, so I'm capable of doing a lot to fix their issues; I also know that the Technicians for the district are sorely understaffed, and that they rarely make it out to some of the elementary schools (and this one in particular*) since the middle and high schools are much larger and have more frequent and numerous issues.

The teacher in question asked me to take a look at her printer (an [HP Deskjet 1000](http://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Printers/HP-Deskjet/CH340A) for those interested in the particulars), and said that it had a tendency to jam. Luckily this was not compounded by software or driver issues. I opened up good old MSWord and typed a few words to print (""Test page, please ignore,"" in true Redditor fashion). I put a sheet of paper in the tray and hit print.

What came next wasn't unexpected; the paper scooted in about an inch, the printer made an odd noise, and on the monitor a ""printer out of paper - please insert more and press the printer's power button once"" message appeared. Well well well. I pulled the paper out relatively unscathed, and opened the printer door up to have a look inside. (This printer has a small door on the front that when opened, gives access to the ink cartridges.) This was of no help. I could see nothing out of order, and the door was too small to really allow me to get at anything that would be inside. However I was able to see that there was no other jammed paper inside, conveniently. 

At this point I close the printer up, hit the print button, and received the same result. Clearly I had missed something. I checked in the paper tray at the back, but still nothing. I proceeded to unplug the printer, and turn it upside down and listen for loose parts, to no avail. I tried printing again with no success, and decided to poke around once more before recommending the printer to the school district's printer guy. This is when I notice it. There's something red down in the paper tray. It turns out to be a [red felt-tip pen](http://i.imgur.com/dC13N.jpg), jammed down in the paper tray assembly.

After finally finding the issue, it took about 10 minutes of reaching and poking and stretching my fingers to actually remove it. It had gotten stuck in a location that seemed to be just slightly narrower than the width of the pen, and definitely narrower than my fingers.

I plugged it in, printed a test page successfully, and then gave the teacher the good news. ""I have not only fixed your printer, I found your pen too.""

^(*For example, several classroom computers still run Windows 2000 after there was a project 2 years ago to upgrade everything to at least XP.)

**TL;DR**: ""I not only fixed your printer, I found your pen too."""

I am a part-time 3L (so I have three semesters left) at a T1 school.  Since starting law school, I have worked full-time as an administrative assistant at the University where I attend law school.  Part of my benefit package is a full tuition waiver.  So to date, I haven't taken out a dollar of debt to attend school.  I also make about $19k after taxes in salary (it would be more, but I get taxed on the tuition benefit as if it were income).

I have garnered some legal experience as an administrative assistant; mostly regulatory oversight and implementation of state regulations for a graduate education degree program.  I also co-authored a law review article with a professor I work with on Special Education law.

My goal when I graduate in 18 months is to work in a law firm, whether big or small, doing civil litigation.  I am really interested in civil rights/civil liberties, but it's my understanding that you need a lot of experience before you get into this field.

My question is:  Should I quit my current job as an administrative assistant, and seek something with more relevant &amp; practicable legal experience?  This would result in me taking out about $30-40k more in debt (on top of the $40k I have from undergrad).  I only have 18 months left to get experience &amp; make connections.  Are those experiences and connections worth the $30-40k investment?  Or should I finish up law school incurring no debt, but having less experience?

I am in the top 10% of my class with a 3.6 and had jobs/internships in undergrad working for major political campaigns and the federal government.  

Thoughts (especially from those of you who hire first year associates) would be much appreciated!


EDIT/UPDATE: I met with our director of Law Career Services, who (from what I have been told) is one of the best in the country.  He advised me strongly to leave my job and seek an internship in a private firm in the summer 2013 - spring 2014.  The bottom line is if I have to take out $40k in debt to finish, but that leads to a job right out of school, I will probably recover that money within the 6-12 months it might take me to get a job (or to not be underemployed).  Thanks all for your responses so far!!!"

I plan on taking Exam P this summer, and I hope to find an internship somewhere. Can anyone help me out by sharing their experiences finding internships, how they found them, what they had to do, and those sorts of things?

   If some specifics about me might help, I am a senior college student studying Statistics in the SF Bay Area. My cumulative GPA is about a 3.06 (I totally screwed up my freshman and part of my sophomore year which is killing my GPA) and I have about a 3.3 Major GPA. 

Thank you so much for your help!"

**if I am posting this in the wrong place, or this is not allowed please let me know!**

I've never had a real interview. I am still in university and this position is for an internship. That being said they have let me know that the position could be anywhere from a secretary type situation in IT to shadowing and working with their development team. Do you guys have any advice for me for the interview? I am currently a Software Engineer major in my third year of schooling. I have quite a lot of practice in Java (which thank god is their language of choice), but I honestly have no idea what they may even ask me. 

Any advice you guys can give will definitely calm my nerves. The interview is set for next Monday and I only received the call today, so I don't have a ton of time to prepare!

Some more information on the corporation: they are mainly an accounting firm but they offer financial services across the board, and no, I truly know nothing of accounting.

Besides that, he is always showing up late for work/events and saying very ""off"" and psychotic things.

Advice Needed.,WoodChopper,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16rcb9/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/,"Okay, for a little background, I am a 20 year old college student with two jobs, one that pays from my on-campus housing and meals, and the other that I am using for strickly saving the money that I earn from it. From this job, I earn about $100 bucks a week, which is pretty modest, but I really want to save up to 90% of the money that I make. All my life I have been educated by my father about personal finance, whether from being forced to listen to Clark Howard as a young kid, or him showing me how to open my own bank account and credit card.

Now that I'm finally into some extra money, I want to make my money work for me, rather than just let it sit in a low-interest savings account. So I kind of made up a game plan of what I want to do and when I want to do it. I am just asking for advice on whether these are good ideas, or if there are other options that might help me better!

So here is the plan:

* First, I plan on having $1500 dollars in my savings account (only earning .15%) by June 1.

* Then, I would like to put all $1500 in either a high interest savings account (about 1%), money market account, or mutual fund (I'm not really sure which? For this account, I want it to be very low risk, but make at much interest/return as possible).

* Continue to save money from my job and open up a Roth IRA, which would double as an emergency fund. (Yes, taking money out of an IRA seems like a big no-no, but it is actually a very viable emergency fund option). I'd like to contribute another $1000 to this account in the months following June 1.

* After I have both of those goals met, I'd like to try my hand at some moderate risk alternatives. My next additional $500 dollars that I save, I would like to invest in the stock market. Now this is where I am not sure what to do. I know I can put that money into some sort of diverse fund, or I can use it to trade myself. I will say I have been successful with stocks in the past (My dad gave me $500 to invest on my own in high school for him and I made 15% in 3 months). But I know I can't expect to get this lucky again.

* The next couple thousand that I make (I expect to make about $5000 as an intern over the summer) I think I would like to put in staggered CDs. This is a technique praised by Clark Howard that you can learn about here: http://www.clarkhoward.com/news/clark-howard/personal-finance-credit/maximize-higher-interest-rates-long-term-cds/nCKc2/.

Okay, Reddit! Thats my plan, what to y'all think. Honestly, I am open to absolutely anything. I feel like some more money could go into long term stocks, instead of some other areas that I listed, but I'd just like to here from some more experienced people! I know I'm not making that much money, and after all this work, I may not have a large return, but I just want a game plan that I can test out before I graduate! I'm still young, so I'd rather make all my mistakes now!

**EDIT:** I am completely debt free. I have absolutely no debt. Not a dime. My college tuition is paid for by scholarships, and my housing and meals are paid for with my Department of Housing job as a Resident Assistant. I have no credit card debt and only primarily use it for gas, snacks, or the occasional night out. So all my debt is already paid down. I'm pretty sure I'll graduate with zero debt.

**EDIT#2:** I also have had a credit card for about 3.5 years and use it for all of my general expenses (snacks, restaurants, gas, and nights out). I've never missed a payment and have zero debt on it. I checked my credit score for the first time a few weeks ago and its a 724. Which, for a 20 year old, I feel is pretty solid?

**EDIT#3:** I also have a car (a 1991 Honda Accord), which has 277,000 miles. It was my first car, and my dad is a mechanic so that's why it has lasted this long. I plan on driving it until it dies on me permanently (I love it so much). At that time, I would get a new car, but probably another used Honda. It would be great if it lasts another 5 years."

I've had wonderful success working with folks from reddit (so easy to work with!!) so here it is!

I'm supporting a very high tech financial company in NYC in adding a tech support specialist to their user support team. 

* You will provide vital support to end-users across the country by answering the support hotline, reviewing user requests and responding to automated alerts

* Also, you will monitor workstation builds, install/update software, and maintain documentation in an issue tracking database

* This position is geared towards individuals with 0-4 years of experience out of the financial services realm; a bachelors degree in some sort of technology field is required (not my rule, my clients!)

* Recent graduates will be considered but you must have strong internship experience (in financial/technology) and a solid academic background (need a solid GPA from a good school)

* You must have excellent communication skills - written and verbal 

* Technical requirements: troubleshooting desktop/mobile hardware and software including Windows and Linux (must have experience with both) 

* Must have experience working with Microsoft Office, Microsoft Exchange, Active Directory, and VPNs (if you've worked with Sharepoint and/or any related financial software that would be great!)

If you feel like you're a fit, please message me and we can discuss in greater detail. I also have an opportunity with the same company but it's a leadership position ~ tech support team lead; must have experience with the same technologies as above but in a leadership position, 5-7 years of experience out of the financial realm.

It began last summer. We had been exchanging messages. She's 2-3 years younger, just graduated, and lived an hour and a half away. She graduated from my college and dated a friend of mine. She was looking for a job in the city so I thought I'd help her out since she was interested in the same industry I'm in. We spent the summer hanging out a lot with me visiting her, her visiting me, dinner, drinks, and eventually hooking up. Nothing too serious. I did meet her mom and brother and we kicked it off pretty well. It wasn't until later in the Fall/Winter where we got closer and emotionally invested in each other. We started calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. We had small arguments with the majority of them being about my inability to communicate and open up to her but I definitely worked on it and texted/called her more regularly. Eventually she managed to score an internship in NJ, about 30 mins from her mom's house while working on the weekends at a small toy store in her hometown and thats when it began to change. The internship required her to move into her uncles for the weekdays and commuting back home on the weekends for her other job. We barely got to see each other but we still managed to see each other here and there.

It wasn't until New Years that I noticed she started to become more and more distant. She was originally going to come to NYC to party but ended up going to Rochester, Utica and Buffalo to party with her close friends from college. That's ok with me. She always talks about missing college, her friends, and stressing about her impending career so I thought nothing of it. I tried not to text her that often to avoid coming off as overbearing. But even when I did, she didn't really reply or replied late. I trust her so I'm assuming nothing happened but I could be dead wrong. Most of her friends are male, but then again, most of my friends are female. I'm trustworthy so she had nothing to worry about. I feel like these are things we ALL go through after college. We miss our friends and we're trying to find ourselves. No biggie, right? But it's like it became a priority for her. Fast forward to last week. Her friends (from H.S.) were supposed to come up last weekend to the city to party. She told me she thought she probably wouldn't be able to see me that weekend. That's fine with me. I'm pretty introverted and don't really like going out too often -- she knows about this. Regardless, they cancelled and rescheduled for this weekend. I had bought tix for her bday weeks ago for a dj set she wanted to see. She texted me, informing me her friends decided to celebrate her bday in the city and cancelled on me. She told me she really wanted to go but didn't want to bail on her friends that she hadn't seen in ages. I replied ""Whatever"" and told her I was bummed out, but she should go hang out with her friends. 

Fast forward to last Thursday, she called me because she said she couldn't hold it in anymore. She basically told me she felt she needed to take a step back to focus on herself, her career, etc. She knows her heart is not set on the city anymore and she wants to leave NJ. I feel the same about the city too but I don't talk about it that often. Me being understanding and having been there said I know what she's going through and I'm here for her. She knows I really like her, but I feel it's not reciprocated. Now I'm back where I started. We still text randomly but it's more of ""Hope you have a good week at work :)"" or things along those lines. I'm giving her space to get her shit together but it's frustrating to me. At this point, I disabled my facebook and told her I'm going to disappear for awhile to do the same. I've never been a confident person so I feel like this was an excuse/opportunity for me to indulge in myself and reexamine my life while she does the same.

Am I wasting my time waiting for her? "

I'm wondering if introducing myself for the presentation is professional or just silly. 

2. I was told I could pick any topic of my choice, whether personal or technical. Are there any topics I should avoid or focus on?

I have had a short film in 5 major Irish Film festivals, including one which I won best student short film(directed it). Got down to the final 2 for an internship on the new Die Hard film where I would be flown out to Bulgaria to work with the director.

I also have a lot of sales and retail experience. I have worked in IKEA for 2 years. I am used to fast paced high stress jobs, I also have great interpersonal and customer relation skills.

I have worked for event companies in Dublin organizing and working concerts and events such gallery openings.

I would appreciate if you guys know anywhere that would be hiring in the summer, any advice would be great. I will do anything basically, retail/bar work/event/production.

Need some advice on how to proceed to get some basic rights",Sulucniv,Finland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/16qz5k/moved_here_from_norway_now_im_stranded_in_the/,"Not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this, but on the off chance that anyone here has any relevant experience, I guess it can't hurt. Onto the issue at hand. Sorry for the wall of text!

I moved to Vaasa in August last year on the account of love, and to get a new job after being sick and tired of working in an office back in Norway. All the colourful and nice *Welcome to Finland* brochures tell you how there's ""free traffic"" of living and working between the Nordic countries, so I was hoping it would go relatively smooth. Nope.


One of the first things I applied for was the FPA card, in order to be included in the social security programme of Finland. The law states that an inhabitant of a Nordic country is to be insured by the state which he or she permanently resides, and I'm registered as a permanent inhabitant of Finland according to the Maistraatit, at the same address as my girlfriend. I've also been registered as unemployed at MOL since the day that I got here, and the EURES person at their office assured me I had everything in order to apply for unemployment and/or labour market subsidy if I started interning somewhere. I then promptly started working at a children's daycare centre as an intern. From what I've gathered, Kela is supposed to pay me labour market subsidy for this. After all, I work full days five days a week and there's a 40 kilometer drive each way to get to my workplace.


I received a rejection letter from Kela/FPA about 3 months after I applied, saying that I do not fulfill the criteria for social security in Finland because I do not have a job or ""any other ties to Finland"". I wrote a complaint and sent it to Kela along with all documentation of my status in the country and rights that should be transferred from the Norwegian social security instance. They got in touch a couple of times and asked for more documentation and information, which I supplied.


Last week I got yet another rejection letter, stating that my case will be sent to the highest instance that handles complaints. Apparently the waiting time there is anywhere between 3 months and 1 year, and I literally cannot afford to wait this long for my case to probably be rejected once more just because Kela seems to have decided for themselves that I'm not welcome here despite having laws and documentation on my side.


I have no idea where to go from here. I'm living off the last money I got when I sold my car before moving here, and I'm actually paying a lot of money in gas to go to work - without getting anything back. This all seems so very wrong, and the last time I talked to my contact at MOL, she just shook her head in disbelief and tried getting in touch with Kela on my behalf to discuss my case, but it didn't lead to anything. I'm constantly applying for jobs and going on interviews, but it's *really fucking hard* to get an entry-level job when you don't speak the language the majority of the country speaks. I do great in Swedish, but there aren't really that many Swedish-Finnish employers hiring. Does anyone know any magic tricks to be welcomed into this country? I'm running out of options, and fast.


**TL;DR:** Kela/FPA won't grant me basic social security rights, despite having all my documentation in order. How do I sweet-talk them into understanding I'm here to stay and not just leech on their welfare system? I must convey to them somehow that I just need some help getting on my feet."
16qyuu,0,2013-01-17,Hello r/frugal! Where my Schweizers at? Anyone have any frugal tips/side job experience in one of the most expensive countries in the world (Switzerland)?,smalrebelion,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/16qyuu/hello_rfrugal_where_my_schweizers_at_anyone_have/,"My story in a nut shell:

I'm a San Diegan who moved to Basel for a Masters in Biotechnology four months ago. My student visa doesn't allow me to work for the first 6 months I'm here and in that time I've blown through most of my savings (read: student loans). I'm looking to get back to budget neutral or even positive if it's possible. I've always alternated between 2 lifestyles: hemorrhaging cash or starving student so it would also be nice to hear advice on finding a comfortable medium.

Current Lifestyle:

Food:

Denner sells 1kg of pasta for ~$1  and pasta sauce for ~$1 so I don't eat much else. 1 of each is about 4,500 calories and lasts me about 2 days. A tube of 20 dissolvable multivitamin tablets costs ~$1 and lasts me about 2 weeks. About once a week I splurge and buy a kebab for ~$8. I know I should cut this out but there is only so much pasta I can handle and this is pretty much my only source of protein.

Income: 

I'm currently making &gt;$100 a week babysitting for two families. In 2 months I'll start looking for an internship and I'm currently looking into becoming a sperm donor thanks to another thread on r/frugal. I may also try to find work at a local scuba shop.

Fun:

I'm trying not to go to pubs as it's too easy to drop 40-50 dollars without even noticing it. Thepiratebay has been my best friend for entertainment. Who knew you could get Crisis 2 for Mac? I also visit my girlfriend in Göttingen every three weeks for ~$130 return. Carpooling hasn't proven to be very useful.

Living:

I found an incredibly good deal for my apartment ~$400 a month with internet, utilities etc.

The point:

Does anybody have any experience finding free entertainment and cheap food in Switzerland? Perhaps other high cost of living countries? Scandinavia comes to mind. Any commentary or advice on living cheaply is appreciated and if anyone is in Switzerland and wants to meet up for a session of oggling Swiss people jealously because they are so fucking rich and don't even know it I'm definitely in."

My average day will consist of browsing Reddit and certain sports sites whilst reading and replying to emails from 9:00-10:00 (sometimes till 11 on a particularly lazy day, like today, it’s almost 11:00 UK time whilst I’m writing this!) 11:00-12:00 is usually a productive hour or I may have a meeting. I take lunch at 12:00-12:30 then 12:30-13:00 is more Reddit time. 13:00-16:00 is usually the time I get most of my work done and have meetings and then 16:00-17:00 is my 'wind down time' which usually involves more Reddit browsing. Then it back home to sift through all the blue NSFW links! Obviously every day is slightly different but this is usually how an average, quiet day at work goes for me.

I’m currently a marketing intern for a public sector company BTW.

3. Best way to keep my bosses updated with my work. I want them to see what I am reading, who I am meeting with, what insights I am forming. But, I would rather it be in a single, well organized place where they can check on an as-needed basis. I don't think a ton of emails are the best way!

What is my professional expertise? Well, none really. Most of my thoughts about dating come from personal experiences, talking to people about their relationships, and a lot of observing. I'm in grad school now and work as an intern therapist with youth and their families. I also have an interest in working with people around their relationship issues, so maybe I'll do something with that after I've graduated. 

I'm not a regular on Reddit, so I'm not really sure how this AMA is going to work. This forum is not huge, so I'm thinking I'll answer questions for 48 hours or so, off and on. That means you can ask anything until Friday evening, PST. I think that about covers it.

I mostly work weekends and make my own schedule, just started this fall. The pharmacy manager was my preceptor, and over winter break when I sent him my schedule he replied that they had budget cuts and wouldn't be able to afford me unless a tech called in sick, which was an issue because I also work for the chain over the summer at home and need 4 hours/month to stay in the system. I've been emailing him checking in for past two weeks with no reply, so I called and apparently he is no longer with the chain.

I talked to the tech and it seemed that it wouldn't be much of a problem for either her to give up 4 hours or to put me on leave temporarily, so she asked me to call back tomorrow to work out the schedule. There is currently no pharmacy manager and one remaining full time pharmacist (who I have worked with). I realized after hanging up that I need my preceptor to sign off of the Pennsylvania intern hours sheet in order for my hours to count from the past four months. 

As of right now, my only plan is to hope that the other pharmacist will let me change her to be my preceptor, but I'm not sure if she'll agree (or if that is allowed for her to sign off old hours at the same store). I was wondering if you guys had any other ideas/advice. I'm also hoping I can get contact info for my old boss, but who knows.

I am finishing up my civil engineering program, with my emphasis/focus on structures.  I heard from a young engineer from a civil firm nearby that now if you want to do structural, you need a Master's.  I should have followed up with him (he was talking to someone else), but I didn't.  So I'm asking you all if you know this to be the case, and why.  I'll have my BS in fall and was planning on working rather than attempting a MS, but I only want to do structural engineering, so I guess I'm reconsidering.  

Also, I'm not sure how my area (central CA) stacks up, but it seems there are few structural engineering firms and internship opportunities compared to other civil disciplines.  Maybe that's why that guy recommended a MS around here.  Then again, far fewer civil students focus on structures.

So, in your areas is a BS typically okay for structural engineering or is a MS nearly required?  Are structural jobs more rare and harder to get than others?  Any general guidance about getting in to structural engineering would be appreciated.  I thought that getting my degree was going to do it, but it feels like I'm hitting so many snags.  Maybe it's where I'm located, but it seems there are civil opportunities everywhere, unless you want to do structural engineering.  Thanks in advance for the help.

**tl;dr:  I want to do structural engineering.  Do I need a MS, or is a BS enough?**"

If I were applying for an internship or job, I would definitely keep it on, but I'm afraid that a 3.4 might give the professor second thoughts about working with me."

I bought a blazer and a skirt today and I need advice on what kind of top would look good with it. 

[Straight On](http://imgur.com/Zshu4em)

[From Side](http://imgur.com/EhiVxBr)

I'm wearing nude stockings and black flats as well. 

It was suggested that I go with a blush top or possibly seafoam green since that's considered in-style right now. I'm either wanting to do a really bright/patterned top or a more toned-down top with a statement necklace.

Everything I've read online says that Nordstrom is really conservative and likes neutral colors to be worn in interviews. I want to keep it fashion-forward but still very professional. 

Any advice would be much appreciated!!

-------------------------------------

**Edit:**  I've made some suggested changes. I've rolled down the sleeves, added a heel, and paired it with a neutral top with some details.

Is this better? It's been suggested I need to get a bigger size so I'm going to go back to the store tomorrow and hopefully exchange it. Any more advice? Does the paired top look good? I want it to be more fashion-forward so if there are any other ideas you guys have about certain tops that would be fashionable and professional, please let me know! 

Thanks for all the help so far!

**Edit 2:**

Thanks for the advice! I will definitely go with a larger size blazer. Now between the outfit posted above and the 2 outfits in this album which do you like best

I am also working as an undergrad researcher. I research off-grid energy flow models. In short I use Simulink to model off-grid homes with solar panels and local battery storage. Recently, I've applied for my dream job - internship at Tesla Motors. I have excellent grades, and I am good with electronics and programming. However I realize that I have a few downfalls. First, my university is not the most affluent in the area (CSU Sacramento). I also realize that hundreds of people apply online with similar amounts of skills and it usually comes down to the numbers game - years of relevant experience, GPA, connections, and luck. In short, I have grades and relevant experience(batteries and sensors), but I have no connections and I don't rely on luck. Thus, I realize that if I don't remind Tesla's recruiters or HR about my existence the chance of me getting to the interview stage is approaching 0. I have no contact information for any of the Tesla recruiters or HR, neither does my school's career department.


I have applied online. Now where your help might come in handy. Do you have any suggestion on what to do to increase my chances? Any tips, suggestions, or advise would be appreciated. If someone knows a way to get noticed by the Tesla's recruiters or any other Tesla's engineers - I am all ears(well, an eyes in this case).

I come before you because I am overwhelmed and could use some outside perspective.


**The Situation:**

I recently completed my M Arch (in December) and also have a B Arch. I have about one year of professional experience that I gained during my M Arch time. I graduated in December and as of today have two job offers that I feel are pretty competitive and I need help making sense of my Pros/Cons. Extenuating circumstances to consider are: moving and the potential for my wife having to leave/not leave her job which is not in architecture (she was recently promoted, she now makes $47,500 salary and benefits). If we relocate my wife will most likely not receive a position at this new title and salary due to her recently coming into it (will likely go back to something closer to $42,000). We can live comfortably with just one of our salaries.

As you likely figured by now I am located in the United States. Not sure if more specifics than that matter since both offers would have very similar living expense situations.


**The Offers:**

*Office A* - Located in the city where my wife and I currently reside. Small start up partnership between two established architects. Would be me, another intern, and them as the founding members. - $20/hr (~$41,600 salary), no benefits for 6 months.

*Office B* - Located in a city 1.5 hours away from my current residence. Established medium sized office (about 45 architects + 20 staff). - $45,000 salary with benefits

**The Dilemma:**

While *Office B* is probably the better choice if comparing things equally (higher offer, more established, etc..) it would require relocating which implies my wife leaving her job and abandoning a recently promoted title and salary. *Office A* being local means we won't have to move and my wife can accumulate an adequate amount of time in her new position. It also poses the potential for me to be part of a new firm and grow along with it as I work towards my IDP and licensure.


I would greatly appreciate any insights and thoughts you all might have. I want to try to make a decision by Monday (01/21) or Tuesday (01/22). Also, please don't take this post the wrong way. I know that many in our field are struggling to find work and I'm not here to gloat my good fortune. I only seek advice from those of you who have worked longer in the industry and may have insights that I currently lack. Cheers!

tl;dr: Two similar job offers. One in my city, one in another. Better office is in the other city. Moving means wife leaving good job. What do?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Do you know any lawyers that are like Saul Goodman on Breaking Bad? Sleazy and infomercial-type kinda lawyers? and what do you think of lawyers like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3vus?context=5)|Sure. I read somewhere recently, I can't remember where exactly, that advertising is a tax you pay on not being very good at what you do. Obviously that's a pretty sweeping statement that isn't true in all cases, but it's true in a lot of instances in the legal field. I have met plenty of lawyers who I would never hire to represent me were I ever facing criminal charges.
[Should the average person have the number of a lawyer handy?  Do people go consult with a lawyer for free prior to any legal troubles, just so they know they have one available?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z75qd?context=5)|It's abnormal for someone to come to me prior to committing a crime, but it's not unheard of.
[I'm an attorney and I regularly deal with advertising with my firm. I would say that in personal injury you MUST advertise to survive. That said, in other legal fields advertising is just stupid (merger's and aquisitions for example\).  It's all context.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdm2z?context=5)|Oh, absolutely. My comment was related strictly to the criminal defense industry and not all lawyers. I'd agree with your assessment re PI lawyers.
[What do you think of those you are defending that you are sure have completed a heinous crime, but then are acquitted? Do you feel bad that a probably guilty, destructive person is out on the streets due* to your good work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3ien?context=5)|I can count on one hand, and I frankly don't need all my fingers, the number of times I've had someone who I believed was guilty of committing a heinous crime actually end up being acquitted of all charges.
[I have a friend who is a Criminal Defense Attorney, and we asked him the same question. He just responds by saying, ""I try to make sure they don't get the death penalty for robbing a gas station."" Is that similar to how you feel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z71q1?context=5)|That's a good way of putting it.
[*attempted manslaughter.*  Is that when you attempt to accidentally kill someone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z7l48?context=5)|Generally speaking attempted manslaughter results from injuring someone (short of murder) in the heat of passion.
[Perhaps not quite what you were expecting from the AMA but could you explain 'attempted manslaughter' please?  Also, do you enjoy your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z7c2j?context=5)|Attempted manslaughter is nearly universally borne out of self defense actions -- think A assaults B and B responds by shooting A but doesn't kill A. B is charged with attempted murder. B argues justification. Jury decides that B didn't intend to murder A, but overreacted to the threat A posed.
[Sorry to detract, but how exactly does someone get charged with 'attempted manslaughter'?  Isnt manslaughter accidentally killing someone? How can you attempt to accidentally kill someone?  Edit; nevermind, was answered below.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdvp9?context=5)|It's incredibly unlikely someone would get charged with attempted manslaughter. I've had one client convicted of attempted manslaughter. That case was a case where he was charged with two counts of attempted murder for shooting two people that were attacking him. I argued that he was justified in shooting them. The jury decided that he was justified in doing something, but that his actions were a bit of an overreaction, and they basically split the baby, so to speak, and ended up convicting him of attempted manslaughter.
[Maybe you aren't the best defense lawyer if all your clients go to jail??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z992f?context=5)|Your reading comprehension skills need work. Well, either that, or your inference skills.
 |Most of my clients avoid jail time.
[Most rewarding part of your job? Favorite kind of cases to work? Do you think drugs should be illegal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3ri3?context=5)|Most rewarding part of my job is an easy question to answer. A lot of people come to me after having made bad decisions that were borne out of desperation, be it familial, financial, or otherwise. Working through the system to ensure that these people's futures aren't horrifically damaged, and then seeing them come out on the other side of criminal charges with an opportunity to put a bad decision behind them and not have it limit their possibilities is a really rewarding scenario.
 |I don't know that I have a favorite type of case, because each case presents different obstacles and opportunities. I think generally my successes in drug cases make them interesting ones to take on.
 |I go back and forth on this question. What I never waiver on is that I think a lot of drugs should be legal in limited quantities. I also strongly believe that the system could do a better job dealing with those convicted of drug offenses to get them help and move them out of a system that can sometimes seem like a revolving door.
[How does it feel defending an obviously guilty person? Trying to get the scum of the earth off the hook? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z4jhe?context=5)|Legitimate question. I have control over what cases I take and what cases I pass on, so there's a bit of a slant to my answer that doesn't apply to the legal profession as a whole.
 |Most people know they're guilty if they're guilty. But most people I represent are guilty of something far short of what they're charged. I can point to numerous occasions when I've represented someone who was guilty of trespass but was charged with burglary. In a case like that, I don't feel bad representing someone who's obviously guilty of trespass and having them ultimately be acquitted of burglary.
[What is the weirdest case you have worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3isq?context=5)|Answered this in the last AMA, and I think it probably depends on your definition of weird.
 |The TL;DR version is that I represented an individual who hired an escort to come to his motel room and watch fetish pornography with him while he told her about his interests/fetishes, and then he paid her for her time with a combination of drugs and cash. Weird, weird fella, and weird, weird story.
[Why was he indicted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3zui?context=5)|He gave drugs to someone as payment for services rendered. That's kind of sort of a no-no.
[How did he get caught? Did the prostitute just rock up to the police station one day and go ""hey hey, this guy paid me with some wack dope, yo. Put his ass in jail""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z6zwr?context=5)|Prostitute got scared by his fetishes and contacted the police.
[Which begs the question as to what it was.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zclrm?context=5)|Not going to go into that much detail.
[Awww, you must be new here. That's kind of our thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdq17?context=5)|The fetish? Or the detail? Ha.
 |Seriously though, it was some weird stuff.
[Everyone says law school is a horrible investment and there'\[in doing this for\]s no jobs these days, is there \[in doing this for\]still room for inexperienced people doing criminal defense?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|I'd say law school is worth doing if you're absolutely certain you want to practice law and you aren't going to be coming out of school with an insane debt burden.
[How common are these for drug investigations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|People gain experience doing criminal defense quickly. I know plenty of people who started out in a 2-3 person firm and after 12-24 months decided to go out on their own, and have made great careers for themselves.
[Just the kingpins making millions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|Long-term wiretaps oftentimes get targeted at people the government thinks are kingpins, but often end up catching lower-level dealers and buyers, because a lot of the big players are smart enough not to get caught up in a lot of that, or they have other people doing their dirty work.
[Have they started using facebook very frequently for investigations yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|Generally speaking, I use facebook more often than the State, but I've absolutely seen cases where the State has facebook posts effectively.
[How much do prosecutors actually know about who's who in the drug game? Most genius/ dumbest schemes you have ever seen? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3zjl?context=5)|Most prosecutors know largely what the police tell them, and not much more. They don't have a ton of time to be investigating crime. A lot of the police officers that I've met are quite knowledgable at what's going on at the street level.
 |Most of the cases I take don't emanate from ""schemes"" per se, in that most of my clients are charged with one-time offenses that they didn't really plan out. I have seen some pretty elaborate schemes though -- such as clients replacing their phone every two-three weeks for fear of having it tapped (which is really annoying when you have to correspond with them).
[Definitely interested to hear how you use Facebook and how the State does.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9g7h?context=5)|Research on witnesses' background of stories / testimony, basically. 
[Have you ever been threatened or come to physical harm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z41py?context=5)|I've never had a client threaten me directly to the point where I was scared for my well-being. I fight hard for all of my clients, and I make it a point to treat each and every one of them like a human being and to respect them, and I think that results in a lot more courteous reaction from them. And I've never suffered any physical harm related to my job.
[What's the typical sentence for drug distributors? Do most snitch? How much does being an informant help peoples sentences? Do people still get in trouble for weed in Oregon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3mug?context=5)|The typical sentence varies based upon the person's criminal history, the type of drug, the amount of the drug, and other factors. I've seen drug sentences ranging from probation to multiple decades. For a first time offender, often drug offenses can result in probation sentences, and/or minimal jail time. It also depends on the jurisdiction you're in, and how common of a crime narcotics trafficking is.
 |A significant majority of my clients are not interested in being a snitch or an informant.
 |Being an informant can help if the client has actionable information that leads generally to multiple people far higher up on the food chain than themselves.
 |Large quantities of weed, yes.
[What's a large quantity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z72vo?context=5)|Depending on the jurisdiction something in excess of 50 pounds of MJ. Lesser weights for harder drugs.
[Have you handled cases involving the drug cartel of Mexico?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z40ks?context=5)|There are plenty of different cartels in Mexico, but yes, I've handled cases involving people involved with Mexican drug cartels.
[How dangerous are they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z41mu?context=5)|In Mexico, they're ruthless, and I've heard horrific stories from past clients. In the United States, far less dangerous because of the fact that law enforcement here is frankly far better, and the threat of capture, prosecution, and imprisonment is far greater than the threat of a similar response in Mexico.
[What kind of stories did you hear?Any examples?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z42t4?context=5)|Nothing too terribly different from what gets reported in the mainstream media in the US -- kidnappings, mass killings, extortion, bribery of public officials, etc.
[Have you ever defended somebody you *knew* was innocent, but then lost the case?  What made you choose Criminal Defense over any other field of law?

It happened once, and the case got overturned thankfully on appeal. The year or so he spent in custody was pretty rough on him and his family, and me for that matter.
[What's the story on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c805wll?context=5)|Guy and his wife live in a trailer, with a driveway and a fenced yard.
 |Guy's friend asks him if he can park a vehicle there for a month or so while he's away on business. Our guy says ""sure, no problem.""
 |The friend drives the car over and parks it in the yard. The friend hands our guy the keys and the friend takes off. Our guy puts the keys on a cork board in his entryway.
 |A couple of weeks later, cops are in the neighborhood on an unrelated matter, and end up running the plates on the car. The car comes back reported stolen out of a city about 250 miles away.
 |Lady who reported the vehicle stolen have a really weird story about leaving the keys in it, and then waited two days to report it.
 |Our guy's friend is nowhere to be found, and the cops can't track him down.
 |Our guy had a lock solid alibi for the day the car was stolen, and there was no communication (calls, emails, texts) between our guy and his friend immediately before or after the theft.
 |The car itself had no visible damage and it wasn't obvious from looking at the vehicle from the exterior that it was stolen.
 |Ultimately I argued that (1) the vehicle want ever really stolen, and that it was likely a case of fraud committed by the alleged victim and our guy's friend; (2) that even if the car was stolen, there was no evidence linking my guy to the theft; and (3) that when he took receipt of it, there was no indication it was stolen, and it wasn't unreasonable of him to keep it parked in the yard, because he honestly didn't know better.
 |At the conclusion of the trial, I moved for a directed verdict - which basically allows the judge to find the defendant not guilty before the case goes to the jury in an instance where the state hasn't proven every element of the crime. I was shocked when that was denied.
 |The case then went to the jury, and the jury found my guy guilty, which was equally shocking.
 |On appeal, the appellate court held that the trial judge should have granted my motion for a directed verdict and that there was no real evidence that my guy was guilty.
 |In the end, it all worked out, but it was really hairy there for a while.

I could regale you with hundreds of instances where defendants were convicted or pled to an amended charge that resulted in a far more lenient sentence than the quantity of narcotics they were involved in trafficking merited.

Even if prohibited from mentioning Nullification directly (as is the case in many courts, as I understand it\) have you ever tried to subtly hint to the jury that they can, indeed, return a finding based on their own moral beliefs about what is equitable, and not a strict adherence to the law as written?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8td8?context=5)|Yea, a couple of times. I can remember one specific case where I had a client who was very likable and relatable, charged with DUI for ""driving"" a vehicle a few hundred feet in order to have her roommate, who was sober, drive them home.

[What is the worst sentence one can receive for DUI?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z40eq?context=5)|Depends on the state, and on the person's record of previous DUIs. Assuming the defendant didn't hit anything/anyone and you didn't cause any injury/death, there are states that have such a thing as extreme, or super extreme DUI that can result in felony prison time.
[*super extreme DUI.*  They couldn't come up with some legaly words for this? did they name the law during take-your-child-to-work day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z71ff?context=5)|Well, I can't speak for all states, but some states have legislators that make you question their sanity.

[Thanks for the reply. As a follow up: Are you ever willing to concede on a ""technicality"" during a trial and allow a flawed process be ignored (I'm not saying made admissible\) for the fact s to emerge or do you just look for a way to get your client out of the hot seat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zbdeb?context=5)|Sometimes you do avoid arguing a ""technicality."" I can think of numerous cases where my client's statement to police came in violation of Miranda, but helped the theory I was advancing, so I wanted to keep the statement in, and thus never challenged its admissibility under Miranda.

Any tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8yio?context=5)|Once you've completed all of your probation, find a lawyer who will work with you to get your convictions set aside.

[I'm currently filling out my law school applications. For the character and fitness section, I need to disclose that I was arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia quite a few years back. The charges were subsequently diverted and are completely off of my record, however from my research I still need to fully disclose any interactions with law enforcement.  My question to you is: what is the best way for me to word this encounter, that would look most favorable to the admissions council? I was considering: ""I was arrested for *suspicion* of possession of marijuana...of which the charges were subsequently diverted"" Is this dishonest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z753u?context=5)|I doubt something like simple possession + paraphernalia would have much of an adverse impact.

[From what I understand, if pulled over for a DUI you can refuse a breathalyzer. The same source, (I think it was an ACLU video\) said that if you are arrested and brought back to the station, at that point refusing a breathalyzer may have consequences / charges. It seems odd that you can't be charged for refusing it out in the 'field', but you can if you're taken back to the station. Any idea why that is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z6mu2?context=5)|There's a difference between refusing a preliminary breath test (PBT) and refusing a breathalyzer (actual breath test).

[Ah, thank you for the clarification.  According to the reporting that came out when oral argument was heard, they seemed inclined to accept the argument that a warrantless blood test is a violation of the 4th amendment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdcc2?context=5)|Yea, that was my sense from reading the reports. That said, oftentimes the questioning at oral argument can lead one to conclude the court is leaning one way, when in fact they come down on the opposite side. The court's decision on the Affordable Healthcare Act is one instance of this.

A guy said that he owned a home and had his girlfriend living with him at the time. Eventually they had somewhat of a fallout and so he asked her to pack and leave before he got back home the next day from work. When he came back the next day he found out that all his locks were changed and that she basically invited her new boyfriend into his home and did not allow him to go in and kick them out. He spoke with the officials and for some odd reason, even though he had proof that he was the owner of the home, they said they couldn't help him out.  What I wanted to know is, is all of that possible? Can the police really do nothing, and if not what CAN you actually do legally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8ufz?context=5)|I'm not an expert in property law, but that sounds pretty fishy.

I also realize that hundreds of people apply online with similar amounts of skills and it usually comes down to the numbers game - years of relevant experience, GPA, connections, and luck. In short, I have grades and relevant experience(batteries and sensors), but I have no connections and I don't rely on luck. Thus, I realize that if I don't remind Tesla's recruiters or HR about my existence the chance of me getting to the interview stage is approaching 0. I have no contact information for any of the Tesla recruiters or HR, neither does my school's career department.

I have applied online. Now where your help might come in handy. Do you have any suggestion on what to do to increase my chances? Any tips, suggestions, or advise would be appreciated. If someone knows a way to get noticed by the Tesla's recruiters or any other Tesla's engineers - I am all ears(well, an eyes in this case). Also on the off beat chance that someone knows a Tesla recruiter...


**tl;dr** Graduating, targeting Tesla Motors, need some advise to stand out from the crowd."

The Newtown tragic shooting is a catalyst for an ongoing conversation about the acceptance or otherwise of the gun violence that we tolerate in America but should not be used as a distraction from the problem of accessibility of guns to a discussion of just mental illness.
 
 I agree with you that it is an outrage that we incarcerate our mentally ill not in mental institutions as in the past but in prisons. I hope we are able to fund research to further understand this area of health that in the past has been out of our medical and scientific understanding and find successful treatments for these health issues.
 
Mental illness is not unique to the USA. The shameful death rate from guns is.
 
The tragedies such as the shooting in Newtown are horrific but are small in loss of life compared to the daily tragedy that occurs throughout our country. No less tragic than Newtown just less of a media pull.   Each of those people deserves the reaction to their tragic deaths that the children of Newton have received. Where is the shock reaction to the brutal and tragic end to those that are shot in Texas?
 
I suspect that it is a matter of numbers; therefore I challenge your office to show each gun fatality in this state the respect that these people deserve by keeping a binder of photos in your office of each of the people shot to death in Texas during the next twelve months. (A good intern assignment) Better still keep their pictures on your office wall. They may not all be as cute or as innocent as the sweet children of Newton but they all had family whose lives are forever changed. The numbers just may change your conversation that surrounds their death and the tolerance we seem to have acquired to it. I hope also that their photos may serve to expand your priorities from a discussion of mental illness toward one of access to guns.
 
In your previous correspondence you say that you don’t feel that laws are the means to change for this issue. Our laws define our expectations. Just as you acknowledge that our society has changed over these past decades then should our laws not change with the times and reinforce one of the very purposes of the US constitution – to “ensure domestic tranquility”?
 
Laws are not the problem, lawlessness is.  Laws are not the whole solution but a defining factor that draws the line in the sand as to what we will or will not tolerate. You say we must utilize social pressure and leadership to instill change. Laws are social pressure and it takes leadership to write, support and enforce them.
 
I have met both you and your wife and know you to be caring people. As a member of congress I look to you for more than prayer and caring, both of those sentiments can be carried out from your home not your office.
 
 I request that you support the laws being presented to congress that require across the board background checks on gun purchases and the ban of assault weapons and multi ammunition clips.
 
Sincerely,

16twvy,0,2013-01-18,Surface RT or Pro,swinebone,Surface,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/16twvy/surface_rt_or_pro/,"I've had a very hard time choosing between the RT and Pro. I've also been considering the Thinkpad Tablet 2, but I'm partial to the Surface line because I want to support Microsoft directly and I feel like the build quality is head and shoulders above any other current Win8 tablet. 

My main uses will be in grad school and at my internship at a local psych hospital. Ideally, I'd like a tablet that has a digitizer pen, but that seems to kick the price up a few hundred dollars immediately. I've also heard many conflicting reports about Clover Trail tablets; I'm skittish about Atom anyway. 

Other than inking, I'd like access to a decent app catalogue and Office. I know the Surface has both of those, but are there any apps or workarounds for something like Zotero or Endnote? I use citation management software often and I'd like to have access on my tablet. 

Finally, I'd also be concerned that if I get the Pro it would be overkill. I already own a laptop that I don't intend to replace or sell and therefore I'm not too certain I'd like to pay for something with an i5. 

At the end of all my rambling, I guess it really comes down to the RT or the Thinkpad Tablet 2. The Surface has amazing build quality and is Microsoft hardware while the Tablet 2 has a digitizer and better docking support. "

Pretty much I worked 4 hours a day doing the tasks I'd previously been doing as an intern, but since I was getting the hang of things it would take less time to do these and eventually I had a whole hour free. I asked my boss if there was anything else I could be doing with my time, and he got really excited for a while about this new project he wanted me to work on. He told me that if I wanted, I could come in for extra hours just to work on this project so I wouldn't feel pressured to do it during my normal work hours. I bumped up my hours to 6 a day and for a while my boss really liked the idea about this new project. Recently he has stopped giving me updates and things to work on for this new project, and even when I show him progress on things he asked for, he wont get back to me for a few days with something new to work on. Basically I am right where I started and have EVEN MORE free time at work than before. I feel guilty getting paid to basically just sit here, but since taking on the extra hours I've quit my other part time job (it was awful, this one pays more anyway, and I've budgeted to be able to work just one) and now I would hate to go back down to 4 hours and potentially have to get another job again. My boss lately has been more ""we'll see where this goes"" instead of giving me anything to work on, and I am having trouble making things up for me to work on when in the past everything I have done for this project has gone nowhere, and I am the only one working on it (very small office).

I haven't really dabbled in any of the other mods for Arma 2 except maybe Wasteland (which really annoys me). The one thing that did interest me about Wasteland is the ability to build structures which are seen in Arma 2. Obviously such structures would be ridiculous in Day Z, but how about smaller ones? I'm talking about base building. Everyone knows that tents, although camouflaged, are easily seen even from a distance, so this means that players have to resort to hiding the damn things within trees or partly in a wall etc; which is incredibly un-realistic. How about, instead of using a tent as a place to set up a base, you could build a number of sizes (all quite small ofcourse) of underground foxholes/bunkers. Not one made out of concrete or other materials, just one dug out by hand and covered either with foliage or wood. It would maybe take a little time to build and would be done quicker in a team but the time spent would be worth it. And maybe for larger teams, players could adapt the foxhole with crates for storage and maybe even add small slit trenches for cover if discovered. The items needed to build such a shelter could be as simple as a shovel. I dont really know how much CPU this would use but I'd imagine not being enough to crash or cause lag, no more than the structures in Arma 2.

This set of ideas came to me after trying really hard to make a nice little base camp, only for some other player to find it and ruin all my hard work. Obviously I dont want the ability for my stuff to never be found, just harder.

I have another idea which is linked to players wanting to make a base. Everyone knows the issue of how bright cars are against the landscape and how, like tents, are very easy to spot. I thought, if the use camouflage netting or other materials is implemented, why not be able to fully camouflage a parked vehicle? Im talking covering the thing in foliage, wood and other things to hand in an attempt to hide it. Vehicles are prized possessions and therefore should be looked after, not driven as far under a tree as possible. This would then intern protect the cars location hidden from players on the ground and helicopters searching from the air.

I dont know if any of the above ideas have been said already but Id thought Id share what I had in mind.
Thanks."

I imagine using my hypothetical Win8 tablet as a companion device, as I already have an X220 that I use as both a mobile powerhouse and a desktop of sorts.

Which, you guessed it, is based in Canada. Its paving a new path to connecting jobs with job seekers. It basically functions like  a dating website, except that your skills and experiences in your profile will be matched to employers. All anonymous, if you don't like their offers no big deal you'll have more to choose from. No more searching for long lists and applying through various outlets. So only the top interns make it to Montreal this summer and get a stipend. I am broke and an unpaid intern at the moment whoring myself out to the best of my abilities. I will bake anyone who signs up with proof (screenshot) baked goods, your choice. That is a damn promise. Snickerdoodles are my speciality. FYI. Help me on my mission and thou shalt be rewarded in sweets."

16t0y9,3,2013-01-18,I am an international student and my bank almost held me ransom to put down security for my card. (CA),praneet87,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16t0y9/i_am_an_international_student_and_my_bank_almost/,"Maybe I was being too dramatic, but this is my situation.

I came to Canada to study exactly 1 year back with enough money to last me a while. I  decided on not getting a credit card then because I didn't wan't to be in a situation where I am carrying over debt every month.

All my friends got cards (Visa) from CIBC and TD Bank without a security deposit. Mind you, we did not have jobs, no SIN number, we were in the country for just 10 days. 

Fast forward 6 months and me and my girlfriend (who is also an International student), apply for credit cards because well, we just landed a good internship that paid well enough and I wanted to build credit history. I explicitly told the Bank (CIBC) that I didn't want to put down any security. So 10 days later I get my card. And for 2 months I am using the card and diligently paying my bills on time. In my 3rd month my card is blocked without a warning. Imagine me paying my lunch bill at work and my card is declined. I call the hot-line and they say since you are in a situation we will let this one transaction slide, but you need to give us a call. So they tell me since I am an international student I need to put down a security deposit for the card. My girlfriend or my other friends have no such issues. In fact they applied for more cards at other banks and are approved. 

I asked them if I made a mistake? They told me that my record was perfect. Now I had to put down money which I didn't want to, and was recently declined another card. Im still an international student and have a year long internship where I make a little over 40k a year before taxes. 

I am aware that as a person with no credit history, I would have had to put down security. But why was I given the card in the first place? and then asked to put down security two months later. If at all that is the rule, how come my friends have 2 cards with limits of 3k each with no security. I only have a $500 limit. They have the same profile as me, 1 year in the country, all international students and making about the same as I am in internships. 

I can't go the branch where I applied from because my college town is in another state from where I am working now. I feel victimized and targeted. My friends are building good rating where as I feel that I probably made it from neutral to bad. I went to local branches and all they say is I understand how you feel but we cannot do anything about it, it's Visa who does all this. I sent an angry email to Visa and they say that we have no proprietary control over the customer accounts. I just feel cheated. Is there any way I can tackle this? Get my security deposit back? Please help me reddit."

16sy6l,0,2013-01-18,The stare,KillTheKinderPS3,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16sy6l/the_stare/,"I might as well start off by telling you who I am. I'm JJ. I live in a rural town with the population barely peaking over 500 people.  I'm unemployed living with my mother and my brother Ryan who is 8. I'm 18 and we get along just fine...until the night of December 18th through the 27th.
I am a heavy sleeper but my brother has insomnia and he just watches shitty cartoon reruns on the television. The night of December 18th, I was awoken by my brother telling me that he heard the sound of tiny pebbles being thrown at my window that points at my neighbor house across the street. ""JJ I'm scared, I think someone keeps hitting our window with rocks."" Pissed off, I said, ""Ryan you have school tomorrow, it's probably one of my friends trying to scare you."" He agreed and he finally fell asleep.

That was only the first night of these ""pebbles"" being thrown at my window. I know my friends would never do such a thing because I only have 1 best friend. 

I wake up mid morning on the 19th. Mom was at work and Ryan just left for school. As I was drinking my coffee, my curiosity kicks in. I thought to myself, ""My brother seemed terrified. I might as well go take a look outside."" As I open my front door I see my neighbor Dennis across the street. He is in his mid 60's and let me tell you, he is the strangest man I ever spoke to. ""Morning JJ"" He said to me smiling. I smiled and proceeded to my bedroom window. I get on my toes to see if there were any cracks in my window. Nothing. I laughed it off thinking my brother was too exhausted and heard things. To my amazement, I was wrong. Right in front of me were six pebbles about the size of my pinky nail. I looked behind me and saw Dennis smiling asking if I needed help. I shook my head no and went back inside.

Around 7 o'clock the in the evening everyone was settled in bed. I could hear my mom chatting with her boyfriend and the sound of Spongebob playing. Ryan asked me, ""JJ. You are tough. Will you fight off the bad guys who threw rocks at the window?"" ""Ryan!"" I yelled, ""there is no time for games. If you hear anything, wake me up."" He had no idea about the pebbles. 

Again, I woke up around 3 in the morning. ""JJ, I hear something outside. Please look, I'm scared."" I rolled out of bed to have a look. My vision is blurry, I didn't feel the need to put on my glasses. I faintly see Dennis watching television behind his faded curtains. Ryan creeps up behind me and whispers, ""No bad guys?"" ""No bad guys Ryan."" I went to the kitchen to start my coffee for the morning and all I hear are footsteps running towards me. ""JJ I LOOKED OUTSIDE AGAIN AND DENNIS LOOKED AT ME."" Ryan said in a quiet yell. I was still groggy and I held his hand and walked him to bed. 

""See? He is sleeping, no lights are on""
 ""But JJ I-""
 ""Ryan, Dennis is old. He probably wanted to see if it was raining.""

Ryan curls up in with his Spongebob blankets and passes out. (He is obsessed with Spongebob.) I stayed awake for the next hour wondering why Dennis up. This was not normal of him to be up this late. To sooth my thoughts I watched some television and went to bed.

The next day rolls by. I must have slept in. I heard my mother yell, ""Get up! I had dinner waiting an hour ago!"" I got up, threw on my glasses and ate some shitty T.V. dinner. Of course, nobody wanted to throw away the trash so I tied it up and left when I finished. Again, I see Dennis walking down the street. He smiled underneath the streetlight. He has this grin that makes his stick out like a sore thumb. Stained teeth with his wad of tobacco always in his lip with this grin that seemed to stare into my soul. I quickly went inside to play my video game.

I slowly started to pass out on the ancient couch. I finally passed out, but the last thought I had was about Dennis.

I was in mid dream and I heard someone fall. I look over at the Grandfather clock. I could only make out a 4. I glance over to see Ryan, nearly pale. ""Dude, you okay?"" He shakily answered, ""D-Dennis smiled at me through his window."" Hearing this made me think this had to be true. I told him to sleep with mommy while I talk to Dennis.

I open my front door and with a head of steam, marched across the vacant street. I knock. ""JJ my dear boy, you woke me up. What's the matter youngin'? Kids ding-dong ditchin' your house? Let me tell you the kids people do for entertainment nowadays."" I spoke about his voice and said, ""None of that sir. My brother keeps telling me you are looking at him through your window. Dennis looked extremely puzzled. ""Why no, I fell asleep hours ago. He shouldn't even be awake. It's Friday morning JJ. Doesn't he have a quiz tomorrow"" He smiled jokingly. I shook my head and told him I was going home.

Now nothing has happened for a few days. No noises, no Dennis. I cannot get him out of my mind. Is Ryan correct? He never does this. So the morning I call Aden, my best friend to tell him the situation. He tells to stop worrying about it and smoke more weed. Unfortunately, he is an pothead with barely any knowledge of anything at all but he does love my photos on my camera. He tells me I should try to be an intern for my paper. What a joke. He decided to stay over for the night for comfort. Again, no Ryan waking up. I now got Dennis out of my head.

I awaken on the 22st of December to the scrumptious smell of eggs and bacon. Of course, Aden ate most of it. I sat down with my mother and she tell me, ""Aden left. Sadly, I am going away for the weekend. However, I have a business meeting with my boss today about a promotion. We can move!"" I was relieved. ""But mom, what about Ryan? He is a ball of energy, how on Earth do I watch over him?"" She chuckled and said, ""Your  a big kid now. I need to go hunny. I love you."" She kisses me on the cheek and grabs her suitcase and off she went. For the remainder of the day I played video games with Ryan and talked about nonsense things with Aden over the phone.

As night comes along, I am exhausted. I guess smoking pot and staying up until 5 was a bad idea. I was about to go to bed but I went outside for some air and noticed Aden's can of chew was next to my window. I knew it was his because he always peeled off the wrappings around the Skoal can. Him and Dennis chew the same type of product, so they get along well. Dennis always talked about how Aden chews more than him, which is completely false. Dennis kills a can a day. I left Aden's chew where I found it and went inside for some shuteye. Again, no Ryan pushing me rapidly to wake me up. 

The next morning I took Ryan to the mall to see Santa and God damn was it annoying. Nothing annoys me more than little kids screaming for some imaginary figure. I told Ryan to go sit on his lap while I walk in to the tobacco shop for a cigar. Damn, 3.45 for this one cigar? Oh well. I went to purchased it. I got chills down my spine when I heard this old man's voice. ""My favorite type of cigar! Black and Mild!"" There he stood Dennis with a can of chew in his hand. I stuttered to get my words together. ""Yeah, I like this one."" I scrambled to find my brother getting his candy cane from Santa. He seemed so joyful.

 I took him home to play some Guitar Hero that Aden let me borrow. Out of randomness, he asked, ""JJ. What are you a-scared of?"" ""Getting any type of cancer."" He knew I smoked cigars on occasion. ""JJ. Stop smoking them then."" Pissed off, I responded. ""Time for bed. Mommy texted me."" Of course that was a lie. I took him to bed. Before I left the living room, he took my camera. ""Just in case I get scared at night, I will take a picture of Dennis' house."" Excitedly, I said, ""Hahaha, gonna be a photographer like me, eh?"" He smiled and went to bed. 

Nothing important happened the 26th; same shit, different day. The night of the 27th is where Ryan used my camera. I woke up to the sun beaming through my blinds. I know for a fact I did not put them down. I bump into my brother sleeping in my bed. He woke up with ease and said, ""JJ I heard something at the window. It was too scared to look so I took a picture. I don't know how to open the picture."" I grabbed it from him and turned it on. It died soon afterwards, which was strange because I charged it the day Aden left. I went to plug it into my computer in my mother's room, and the Sony camera program opened up. I clicked on the picture folder and Ryan did take a photo. After a minute and a large deep breath later, I forced myself to open it. I was in utter shock. Complete and utter shock. I saw I lip with chew packed in a lip with Aden's can. Etched on the top of the can said one word. Hello. It was Dennis. 

I cannot explain how much shock I am in now. I grabbed Ryan and took him in my car to Grandma's house. He loved it there so I know grandma will look after him for a few days until mom comes home. As soon I dropped him off, I quickly called Aden. It rang 4 times and went to voicemail. I called again and instantaneously he answered. One word was spoken over the phone. ""Hello."" Holy shit. That was Dennis and in the background I heard Aden's muffled voice. I could not make out a single word of his. I'm on my way to Dennis' house now. I will get back to you guys as soon as I can. Don't bother calling the cops. They are more worried about robberies and shootings."

I picked it based off some intro classes in high school and my freshman year, thought I'd like it. Also the money's good. Nearly to my senior year, and haven't found a single thing in it that I really enjoy. I'm decent at the math, but it's never been something I like to do. I'm terrible at remembering all the theories and laws for circuit analysis and signal processing, and haven't learned anything about designing/building systems. I haven't got a single useful thing to offer that I didn't have before I got here.


At this point, the only motivation I have left for going to class and trying to learn this stuff is that I can't afford to fail. I'm nearly $50,000 in debt already through loans, and it's looking to be better than 60,000 by graduation. It's too late to switch and do something else, so I need to finish so I can get a job and pay the loans back. There's no way my family could afford it if I fail out of can't get a job.

Maybe I missed opportunities somewhere to learn the important stuff. Maybe I didn't apply myself to my studies as hard as I should have. All I know is that at the moment, it looks like I'm either going to fail out, or graduate into a career field in which I'll be useless. 

I was the golden child, third of six and the first to go to college. I think they've given up on that now. My sister is a year behind me and already has an internship and jobs lining up for her, while I've got nothing to show for my 3 years out here but a pile of debt that could cost my parents their house if I can't fix this.

We've been dating ever since (just over 6 months). She attends school about 1000 miles away and we do visit each other often. When we're both at home, we are constantly Skyping and talking on the phone (quite literally), and it's great. I love it, really.

But I'm trying to head off boredom/complacency at the pass. I just want to be able to keep spicing things up.
I send her flowers or gifts every once in a while. I text her sweet things out of the blue. But I'm afraid I'm running out of things to keep it all interesting.

Now, don't get me wrong. This relationship is amazing. And really doesn't show any signs of the boredom that I'm afraid of, but I really love this girl, so I just don't want to mess it up.

So, I guess my question is: Reddit, do you have any particular things that worked for you in a long distance relationship to make sure that it lasted and didn't get... old?

I just interviewed for another IT internship, however this one is unpaid and full time. The interview was stellar and the bosses were impressed with me. In addition to this, a large number of positions were open, thus improving my chances at landing the position. Even better yet, the office is just 10 minutes away from where I live, in a beautiful location.

I'm 24 - working for a big company for 18 months now, making $58k. 

**Assets:**

* Roth IRA - I put 5k into this after an internship and it's managed by mum's financial advising company. Should I move it elsewhere? Leave it? It's at about 5,800 right now. I'm not actively contributing to it.

* 401 (k) - This is through my company. They match up to 6% and put in a base 4%. I originally was at the 6% minimum, then upped it to 10% and now I've increased it to 20% (this is the value you will see on the coming spreadsheet). This is at 13k.

* Emergency Fund - I have none. I know this will be the first thing people will tell me to fix.

* I have about $600 in a bank account, as I just got back from a trip and spent a good amount.

**Debts -**

* Car Loan - $11k, paying $266 a month - 3.74% APR - Blue book on the car is about 9k.

* Loan from Mother - $5.1k - was $9k, and I've been direct depositing 100 a week into her account. This is what I have instead of Student Loans.

* Credit Union Line of Credit - $1800 - 10% APR. I used this to pay down my Visa (26% APR) and Amex (13% APR) which are now both at 0

**Budget**

Right now, I'm having my paycheck be split into 3 places (after 401k and taxes are taken out)

* Credit Union - $200 a week - this is where i pay my Car loan and line of credit from

*Mom's account - $100 a week - this is where I pay her back from

*  Bank checking account - Remainder - this is where the rest goes

Here is my current budget:
http://i.imgur.com/8F6kh.png

My car insurance is very high. It actually just dropped by $80 a month because I moved to a lower risk city. That should drop when I hit 25, but for now I'm just driving safer.
I read in another thread someone suggesting cutting a Gym membership. I find the spending of the funds to be a strong incentive to get into the gym, and for right now, while I'm trying to get back in shape, I won't eliminate that.

**Retirement/Investment Help**

The 401k contribution is at 20%. I understand I should probably drop it, but something a friend said once stuck with me. If you just overload it in the first ten years, you can cut your contributions back drastically, as the gains on that nest egg will probably surpass what you can contribute at that time. Here are my options for a 401k funds. http://i.imgur.com/htUpi.png 
I would really appreciate it any input on these. I am currently contributing 

* 15% Hotchkis &amp; Wiley Diversified Val

* 15% Morgan Stanley Small Co Growth I

* 15% Dreyfus/The Boston Co Small Cap Value I

* 55% Custom Retirement Target Date 2055 Fund

My Roth IRA. Like I said before, I haven't touched that since the originally 5k deposit. I feel iffy about putting more money into the hands of a small city Financial Adviser. However, I think I should be contributing to this as well as my 401k, so I'm a bit stuck. Should I take it out of their control (can you do that?) or just open a different Roth IRA?

Index Funds - I approached a friend who has been earning more money since graduating from school about what he's been doing with it. I think, beyond a 401k, he's managing his personal money through a Vanguard account and is investing in Index Funds, which he says are a good bet if you don't want to toy around with stuff too much.

Thank you for reading and providing any feedback!"

Should I combine all the work experience with the same company together? They were different internal groups, and work varied wildly.

We seem to talk more about him going to college than me...when I am the one leaving in 6 months. He seems less upset than me about my leaving. Sometimes I just think, what's the point of staying together? Another reason I am upset is that last week we went out with some friends and he told everyone that he was leaving in the summer for a month to do an internship across the country. I had to leave and started crying when I got home. I was upset because he didn't even think about telling me this privately first and also because he's leaving before me and doesn't seem to mind. He is still adamant that he will love me no matter how far apart we are... but I'm not quite as secure. Of course, I want to be supportive, but I think it will take time. I sometimes get into phases where I get really insecure, especially in our relationship. This may be one of those phases...but it feels different. I need advice. Am I blowing all this way out of proportion?





tldr; boyfriend and I will grow distant when I go to college and he goes to an internship. Is it worth staying together?"

When I was 16 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and I was put on the highest possible dose of Cymbalta. I don't know if it's the Cymbalta or the way my body reacts to alcohol, but drinking has never gone very well for me. The first few times I got drunk in college I had crippling panic attacks or I would end up making out with a friend when I was already in a serious relationship. When I got a fake ID at 19, I found I didn't get as drunk because I didn't want to get caught and I found alcohol had lost it's appeal because it was easier to get. But then, one night I blacked out for the first time at a bar with some friends and ended up waking up in a hotel room of strangers downtown with no idea how I got there. I was raped when I had only been with one man my entire life and I planned on marrying him. It was devastating for me, and I definitely used alcohol to cope. I drank to the point of blacking out 4-5 times a week, I was always the drunkest person at parties, and I was that pathetic drunk girl making out with any guy who showed interest. I ended up in the hospital once and my roommates kicked me out after I brought a guy over who left after I passed out, but first puked in our living room and dug through my roommates drawers. When I turned 21 I started drinking to the point of urinating myself any time I passed out. This is really embarrassing for me, because it's happened in cabs, in stranger's beds, and it's ruined a mattress for me. I graduated college and waitressed at a sports bar and started drinking after 3am on a regular basis so I could unwind and sleep. Around this time I had a guy break up with me because he thought I was going to end up dead from drinking and he was sick of me peeing in his bed. A few months later I finally get my life together and meet an amazing guy who introduces me to weed, and I stop drinking altogether. I didn't need it anymore because I was happy and content, and if I wanted to unwind I'd smoke and go running. This fall I started grad school and I had to stop smoking to get an internship, so I turned to drinking again and it's all gone back to shit. I ended up in a threesome I didn't want, I pushed a friend into the sidewalk, I passed out in an alleyway, and I keep waking up on the floor covered in my own vomit and piss. My boyfriend is getting sick of me, I can tell. Last night we went to a wine and cheese party and once I realized everyone was getting drunk I proceeded to get wasted. I passed out in a chair and had to be carried to my boyfriend's car. I'm finally in the process of weaning off the Cymbalta, which I've been on for 6 years at the highest dose, so I'm hoping this Russian Roulette of getting black out whether I have one drink or ten.

I'm 22 now, and my life is good, but I want to learn how to control this. I don't want to lose the most amazing person I've ever met because I need some chemical escape. "

I would appreciate if you read my post. I follow this hread closely and really like the number of strong and independent women on this thread. Please tell me what you think -oh and I would live to hear from the men as well, as long as you clarify what gender you are!

I am 19F and just in the beginnings (3months) of the most serious relationship yet. I am very inexperienced with relationships, and I suspect that I may be having too-high expectations of my SO. Let me explain:

I have a lot of stress in my life due to family and financial issues, and I can be really upset or disappointed if I can't be the best I can be (eg being a good daughter, breadwinner of the family, taking care of my autistic brother, straight As, keeping up with internships, being a good and caring friend, etc...). I get pretty stressed if I fail myself or my friends or family. When ingot into a relationship with my SO, who I truly care for, I expected that he would automatically want to me feel better whenever I was extremely down (I would gladly do the same). However, it seems more like that he will listen, give a few half-hearted pieces of advice, then move onto the original topic of conversation or some jokes. 

I asked my friend about this, and she said that while it is essential that both people communicate their problems, it isnt mandatory for the person to always comfort their SO, because an SO isn't a therapist. She also suggested that maybe guys prefer to minimize problems rather than talk and discuss and comfort. 

This made me feel really sad and confused, because that means that whenever I need comfort or reassurance my friends are the better people to talk with, not my SO. And I guess I foolishly thought that an SO would be that one person in the world I could always share my insecurities and feelings with.

What are your thoughts on this? Am I being too immature to expect my SO to cheer me up during the times when things are difficult? I can understand he may not always want to cheer me up all the time, but the fact that my friends care more abou comforting me than him makes me a little sad. Or is it a gender thing like she suggested?

Lastly, could you give me any advice about being able to stay strong/not be gloomy whenever you face tough moments in your life?

Thank you!"

Also: What exactly is an internship?,solid_steel,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16vlfm/combining_internship_with_freelance_work_newbie/,"I want to break into the web-development field. I already made the first steps, I have a website, a portfolio of code, and I contribute to opensource a bit.

After looking for entry-level jobs on CS and a bunch of other sites, I see that entry-level means ""at least a year of this, this, that, and this"", which I don't exactly meet. So I started looking for internships and I have two interviews setup next week, which is pretty damn sweet.

I know this will sound funny to most of you but - what exactly is an internship? The ads only mentioned 15-20 hours of work per week, one mentioned a stipend and the other a ""daily rate"". How reliable are internships? What can I expect salary-wise?

My second set of questions pertain to freelance work. I have a goal amount of money I need to make in 7 months so I thought that in addition to an internship I could do freelance web-design/dev. I found that online freelancing services are flooded with workers from the near, middle, and far east so I was hoping to set up shop locally ie. cold call local businesses, present my offer, and maybe snag business. Does this seem viable in New York City?

Maybe I should ditch my dream job for now and go for steadier employment as a PC helpdesk/support as I already have some experience and certification in that field - I really need about 7k$ by August so I have to choose the best route?

I'd really appreciate any input on this as I'm pretty new to NYC and the US in general. Thank you very much!

edit: P.S I also thought of contacting HR people (or people involved in the company) directly with my resume and a cover letter as well as a solution I could supply to one of their problems. That way I could expand my job search from merely looking over CS/Monster/etc.. Is this sort of contact acceptable? Is it a good idea?"

I had run away from my home. I'm sick of all the lies my 'role models' tell me. My name is Jonathan Suburbia. My friends at my homeland called me the Jesus of Suburbia. I miss my friends at home. The name of it is pointless now. Here in America, I have nothing. I do blend in well as a regular white suburban teenager, living in a ordinary suburban town called Longview, California, and; blgahagah! I am sick being a normal American Idiot! 
Then it happened. As I was deep in thought, I crossed the street, then a white Ford SUV came and hit me. My body buckled like I had been shot with a shotgun in the chest. I hit my skull on the hood and then the pavement below me as I fell to the floor in pain. I'm not sure if I blacked out from the pain or got knocked out from me hitting the car and the pavement. 
When I woke up I was in St. Jimmy's National Hospital. I as I came to I heard this voice in my head, a voice that I have never heard in my life, raging and rebelling against everything that I kept secreted in my mind. It hurt. Then a nurse came over to my cot and spoke to me. I noticed her name tag hung from a lanyard around her neck. Her name was Maria Liberty. She was a sight to behold after what happened to me. She said,"" Good mourning John!"" Her smile probably cured a case of cancer at one point. I know it stopped my headache. 

After a bit of routine vital signs check, Maria helped me off the cot and into a wheelchair. We made idle conversation as she brought me into a room with a two men and women, sitting at a table together. One man just stared at me. I knew that disappointed face from anywhere. It was Brad. My stepfather. He always seemed to be neglecting me and me being around him made him very angry. He looked disgruntled and unhappy about me still being alive and breathing. My mother's face was red and her eyes were wet with tears. The other man turned out to be a doctor. He was was a bald old man with glasses. He smiled gently at me as he looked up from his clipboard. He turned his glance toward Maria, my parent, and THAT other person, and motioned for them to talk with him. Being the eavesdropper I am, I listened closely. 
""Mr. and Ms. Suburbia, John has suffered a major blow to his brain after his accident,"" he said sympathetically. ""He now has permanent damage to his prefrontal cortex, deep limbic system and his temporal lobes. These are the parts of the brain that essentially control our emotions,"" the doctor said sternly. ""I'm sorry to say this; but your son now has a multipersonality disorder. We have had cases like this in the past and we call it Saint Jimmy's disorder."" The doctor's voice began to crack. ""Your son is expected to live for 1 year.""


The voice in my head begins to take control of me. It tells me this,"" That's a lie Jesus! They just want your parents money! The government just wants your money!"" I didn't know what to think of it so I let out an enormous scream. I shouted to St. Jimmy,"" GEEEETTTTT OOOOOUUUUUUTTTTTT!!!! My Mom and Brad jumped and so did Maria. I was pale and breathing heavy. Maria came over and sat down on my lap. When she sat down St. Jimmy disappeared. POOF. Out of my mind. I started to relax as she put her hand on my cheek and rubbed her thumb back and forth on it. We shared a moment, alone in the world. Then the doctor cleared his throat and spoke. ""It seems John's disorder disappears when Maria is around him,"" He said with a smile. ""I think we will start the therapy with Maria accompanying John."" He turned his glance at me and said,""There maybe hope for you yet, John.""

After that ordeal was over and done with, my parent gave me some money so grab some food at the Cafe. I brought Maria with me. I asked her what she does for a living. She says she interns here, but that's not her real job. I asked her what it was and said,"" How about you come with me to work tonight, John?"", she said with mischievous smile. She saw the worried look on my face and said,""Don't worry it's not like we are going to get caught."" I thought to myself, she's a rebel all right. Later that evening she appeared outside my door. She was the definition of an angel. She was wearing a pair of skinny jeans with a men's black button-up shirt with a red tie on it. Her hair was in a pony tail and on her lips was the reddest lip stick I've ever seen. Her top two buttons on her shirt were unbuttoned so I could see a bit of hear cleavage. She teasing me, I thought. Jimmy had something to say too. ""It's not going to work John. She's not your kind of girl."" I fire back at Jimmy,"" I will make her mine! Jimmy had enough. He took control and told her to wait a second and guided me inside. He sat me down at the dinner table. He said,""Look Jesus, I know your exited about 
dating... Ms. Whatsername out there. But your no rebel, you have no guts. I backed off today to see what you would do. AND YOU DID SHIT ALL! Let me show you how to give Whatsername the time of her life."" My head started to ache. I am now St. Jimmy. I picked myself up and took some Novacaine and rejoined Whatsername outside. She was about to say something but my lips stopped her and she closed her eyes. We hurry along in a taxi to a club in town. We go inside and she disappears among the crowd. I find her again and shes with a white guy with dreadlocks. She was sitting on the floor getting high on weed.  Her top is unbuttoned and her bra is on the floor next to her underwear. She offers the blunt to me and I accept it. Jesus in says in my head, ""Don't do it Jimmy! We are going to get in trouble!"" I take a big sniff of air and start to feel the effects. I sink to the floor next to Whatsername and lean my head against her shoulder. She tells the white guy to get us a drink. He comes back and we drink until we get wasted to the point where she kicks a stripper off of her place and replaces her. And does better. Then I hear the sounds of sirens outside.

 Jesus says to me,""SHIT! We are done Jimmy; it's over."" I thought of any way out and I saw a the fire door identified by a red EXIT sign. I quickly picked up Whatsername while she was still giggling drunkenly from all the booze we drank tonight. She cussed at me for taking her away from her position as the center of attention to the male patrons at the club. I made a break for the door, when Jesus said something,"" D-DUDE! That door has an alarm on it!"" I disregarded his warning and burst through the door carrying Whatsername in my arms. Then the bell sounded. The sprinklers came on and tried to put out a fire that didn't exist. I could hear the people screaming from the water getting soaked. I laughed to myself as I ran. I ran to my home and never looked back. I layed Whatsername on the couch. She said as her eyes closed,""Best 20 minute date I've ever had."" I buttoned her shirt back up and sort of just drooped down to the floor and passed out. I could tell Jesus was impressed. Maybe even jealous.

 I woke up with the biggest headache ever, probably from Jimmy and... her, going to the club and getting drunk of their asses. Also, Jimmy had gone to sleep for today, he told me in my dreams. I was in control for today. I saw her get up, stretch and let out a big yawn. She rubbed her eyes and then her neck, probably from bunking on the couch all night. She looked really hungover. I said smoothly,"" Good mourning, sleepyhead."" ""Mourning Jimmy,"" She says half asleep. Then she realizes that Jimmy is not here but instead it was the non-rebelous  John Suburbia. She smiled kindly at me and then I heard HIM come down the stairs. Brad came down the stairs to see us sitting next to each other in a moment. His face swells up with anger at me. Probably from the sight of ME being with a girl that was AMAZING. ""JOHN WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING TO HER?!!"", he bellowed. ""SHE'S YOUR NURSE NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND!!!!"" I called for St. Jimmy in my head to help me but he told me sort it out myself. I took a deep gasp of air and while he was still babbling, I let out at the top of my lungs,""Listen asshole, she is mine and you can't say otherwise! I am TIRED of you neglecting me and you telling me what to do. Hell, your not even my dad. You just married my mom that I love, oh so much, so you could sleep with her!!! You know what we are done here! Maria... let get the hell out of here."" I could see him beginning to swell up with anger as me and Maria walked out the door. To my surprise he seized me by the by the collar of my shirt and held me against the wall next to the door. He called for my Mom. As soon as she came down the stairs I curled my fist and hit him square in the nose. I heard the *crack* as his nose bent and broke. He released me and I ran out the door with Maria at my heels. We stopped at after a few blocks to catch our breath. Maria asked,""Jesus is going to be jealous after that Jimmy."" I laughed and then said,""That was me, the Jesus of Suburbia.""

16vhdt,6,2013-01-19,"Dear Reddit, I have almost $60k in student loans but I only make $31k.  I'm on IBR, but I still wake up in the middle of the night freaking out about my loans.",curlygirl507,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16vhdt/dear_reddit_i_have_almost_60k_in_student_loans/,"So here's my situation.  I graduated from college in 2009, the very worst year ever to do so in terms of finding a job.  I decided to go through a one-year master's program in public administration, which is a professional degree (like an MBA but from the public sector viewpoint).  My plan was to get some type of federal job and have the loans forgiven after 10 years, therefore I was willing to borrow a bit over $40k for the degree.  That was THE ONLY reason I was willing to take out those loans.  

My program was very good, it was in the city with the second-largest number of federal jobs in the country after DC, and I went to all the networking events and had internships, etc.  However, I discovered the hard way that it is actually impossible to get a government job.  I believe I applied to something like 150 jobs by the time I graduated.  (I realize this doesn't sound like a lot, but these job applications take a few hours and I was in an accelerated master's program.  You have to write pages about your qualifications, provide supplemental documents, etc.)  I tried the feds, locals governments, state agencies, nonprofits, think tanks, and everything.  It's impossible.  

I had to move home, which is a second-tier city.  I started tutoring, which had been my college job, and for almost two years my income level was about $9k.  My loans were on IBR, but still building interest.  Then, last year, a miracle happened.  I was hired at a private company at the princely sum of $31k!!

I am very grateful for my job and I really like my company.  I'm doing extremely well and was recently assigned to a very high level client and to work on a big project for them at the same time; they requested me specifically.  I feel so happy that I've had this chance and it's working out.  But the thing is, now my loans aren't going to go away in 10 years - it's 25.  And also, my company has a reputation for not paying people that well and not giving large raises.  And there aren't any other similar companies that could steal me away in the area.  

So redditors familiar with the private sector, please give me your opinion.  If someone is doing really well in their job, do you think it's very likely that they will eventually reach a substantially higher income level?  Or do you think it's possible this place will keep me at $31k forever, no matter how great I'm doing?  Will I *have to* move to a larger city with more companies if I want to do well?

I'm wondering if I could fairly quickly get to a level where I could really start paying the loans off.  If they're going to keep me at the same lower level forever, then I feel like I might as well just keep doing the minimum IBR, but if my income is going to go up then I ought to really start buckling down on the loans.  I never planned on working in the private sector so I don't know how getting promoted and soforth works.  Any thoughts?"

As a male engineering student I am running into problems getting a summer internship offer. It is crucial for engineering students to get internships over the summer if they want hopes of having job offers out of school or even graduate. Here is some backstory:

I am currently a petroleum engineering student. I have a perfect 4.0 gpa and I am involved with several organizations with the school like habitat for humanity, society of petroleum engineers, and even play music for a school music group. Me and my friend, who is also a male with a 4.0 cannot for the life of us land jobs, however every girl in our class has a job offer. One girl in particular has a 2.7 gpa and has no extracurricular activities whatsoever.

I feel like in the minds of the companies, in an effort to be ""fair"" they hire an even number of men and women. 50/50. However, the problem arises when the students in my class are 80% guys and 20% girls. Why can't the companies choices reflect the demographics of the pools in which they are hiring, or at least look at skills and talents instead of names and genders? I have been lurking on this subreddit before and was wondering if this problem classifies as a mens rights issue.

tl;dr Men in my school are losing job offers to women who are less qualified then they are."

16vaap,1,2013-01-19,I'm an inadequate shitbag,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/16vaap/im_an_inadequate_shitbag/,"No throwaway because fuck it, this is bullshit melodrama anyways that doesn't compare to some of the stuff on this subreddit.

I'm at that stage in life where it's more or less a giant breakpoint.  If I make the wrong decision, it'll have lasting emotional (and potentially other) consequences, and I'm just not in any state to deal with it right now.  College, freshman year, four-year school, prospective game design major.  I'm actually declared as a major in Animation (with a focus in 3D), but I've recently discovered that I really have zero passion to do anything related to animation beyond having a passing interest in it, hence my desire to change my major to something I already have a vast skill set in.

I'm from a rather well-to-do family, but I had a hard time in high school, and ended up here at this high-tier school which primarily specializes in visual fine arts--and before I continue, I have to ask that you please withhold your ""don't go to art school"" bullshit, because whether your degree says BFA, MD, or BS next to it, whether or not you get a job has far less to do with that and far more to do with the connections you make and the portfolio you build to demonstrate your skills.  The degree may as well be a fucking formality, from what I've seen.

Back on topic, my dad really wanted me to go to an Ivy League-tier school.  Obviously a 3.0 student (which is a C average in my home state) wasn't going to do that well, so I ended up here, which I'm generally pleased with--but I still take flak for it.  ""You go to an art school?  Have fun bartending for the next ten years.""  I've learned to tune those people out, but constantly hearing it from peers outside of school is starting to affect me, sometimes even belittling me.

Few people see the practicality in choosing game design as a major.  Explaining that I go to an art school is one thing, no matter how prestigious it is, but explaining that I'm a game design major?  Not a single damn adult I've met seems to take the idea seriously.  I guess I'm just throwing away four years by following a passion, nevermind that I plan to get a second degree (associates, tech school) in networking after I start working in case things don't work out.  Dear ol' Dad who wanted me to go to an ivy league school, he's one of those adults who doesn't take the idea seriously, and I am mortified of the idea of letting my parents down.

There's other things bothering me, too.  I'm hitting some speedbumps in my relationship at the moment--for example, she seems to want me to stand my ground more often and stop being a pacifist *all* the time (though she prefers that I not become hotheaded and arrogant, so I've been trying to find that sweet spot).  I did so tonight, and I either acted arrogant or failed to find the happy medium, because she was quite put off by it.  I felt like shit for letting her down because I love her dearly, so I recluded myself to my room in the condo to think on it and possibly separate her from the problem--me. (This is a family reunion for her family, and they've invited me--no, they didn't notice that she and I argued, so it stayed between she and I.)  She later came in to tell me how rude I was being to the family by being reclusive and antisocial.

Great, I let her down again.  I've been doing some rather trivial things to frustrate her lately, this included--and almost all of them preventable, but my own apathy as of late has kept me from intervening ahead of time.  We've been together for a year and a half, and I think I'm a pretty shitty significant other for upsetting her like this.  And yet she still holds out for me and cares for me, despite this.  Goddamn my stupid laziness and self-hatred.  If I wasn't such a pacifist fuck, maybe I wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place.

To top it off, I've hit a dry spell as far as inspiration goes.  Right now is a critical period for me if I have any desire to obtain an internship, and this means portfolio expansion.  I can't think of shit.  When I do, it's either too complicated to implement or a complete ripoff of a pre-existing work.  I'm a failure of an artist.

All of the above combined with trivial little things that I've done to prove to myself that *I'll always finish second, even when the challenge is between me and myself* has culminated into a self-hating spiral of depression.  The following outlines how I would currently address myself if I were to come face to face with a doppelgänger:

Fuck you and everything you stand for.  You're useless.  Half of your family is probably disappointed with you, you regularly frustate the one person you really love and try to find comfort in.  The thought of not having her tortures you.  Good.  Keep thinking about it, dirtbag. You can't finish that game you want to build.  You can't even play all the way through one right now, because you're so goddamn apathetic.  You might as well be committed, considering your borderline paranoia.  There's also how you'll just be standing alone, thinking about how shitty of a person you are, and then say something random like ""fuck you"" or even ""I love you"" (what the actual fuck?) because your brain is trying to get its bearings from reliving traumatizing past experiences.  What sane human being even fucking does that?  You, you cockmongering fuckwit.  You're probably going to die alone, and your regular masturbation habit will probably end up nuking whatever marriage you could have in the future, porn or no porn.  Don't even bother killing yourself, you deserve the pain you get for being such an inadequate bag of shit.

16v9tu,3,2013-01-19,Please give me advice,[deleted],stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/16v9tu/please_give_me_advice/,"I've been drinking heavily for about the past 10 years. I am now 28 years old and would like to just stop drinking altogether, as for the most part it's made me miserable.

I've made so many mistakes and lost a lot of friends and self respect while drinking.  When I get drunk it's now to the point of black out, yet as an experienced drinker I will not pass out or throw up, but continue on with the night, but of course the following morning I remember nothing.

I haven't had a serious relationship in about 5 years and believe drinking is in part to blame.

Anyway, enough ranting. I need advice on how I can stop drinking without killing my social life. The problem I face is that I currently work with interns who are all in their early 20's and want to go out and party. I feel pressure to go out and party with them, so that I do not seem like a boring guy.
I also think on some level, because I am craving for a serious relationship, I feel that if I don't go out I could be missing an opportunity to meet some one.

I just don't know if I can stay in my room on a Friday/Saturday and get an early night, but what are the alternatives? Thanks."

16v7s4,6,2013-01-19,Am I really depressed or just sad frequently?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/16v7s4/am_i_really_depressed_or_just_sad_frequently/,"This is my first post. I signed up for reddit just to here some other opinions and my family and friends have a tendency to overreact to this sort of thing. A nice anonymous discussion would be great. Also silly pictures. Those are nice.

I've been reading stories of others from this subreddit and my story pales in comparison. My home was stable (aside from a few scares and blips) and my grades have been decent. Grade and high school were a bit rough socially but I got through it and I'm a senior in college now getting ready to graduate. I remember seeing a therapist briefly in 6th grade in response to some anger issues that are well gone now and their were a few episodes in High school where I mentioned suicide outloud, and once Sophomore year of college, but I was drunk as hell and hardly remember it, I only learned of it from my friends later. I chalk that one up to excessive booze and have cut back significantly since then.

College for the most part has been fine, however second semester of Junior year, everything blew the fuck up. My fraternity was caught hazing, a practice I never supported for the record, and the school went through every effort to demonize and punish us, most of it deserved. Our officers were removed from the fraternity and fined. We needed a new president and I was picked for the job. Not five minutes after my election, I get a call from my dad saying that my cousin was in a DUI wreck and had lethal brain damage. The rest of the semester was hell trying to get the fraternity back on its feel, dealing with the grief of my family, and two seminar classes. I also kept getting rejected from internships which didn't help. I was exhausted and towards the end, I was ready to give up. Just leave school and do something else. I was miserable and felt a lot of guilt over the hazing thing and still do. Looking back, I'm not sure how I didn't have some kind of breakdown. (I may have, but I don't know how to tell if you are having one or what symptoms are).

But as I'm a senior and most of the stuff below has blown over, I still have this miserable feeling that I had during the worst of it all. I don't enjoy going out anymore, I've lost the desire to hang out with friends or hang out. Heck, even the improv troupe I'm a member of has lost a lot of it's fun. But what doesn't make sense is that I am still functioning fine. My grades are fine, I can make basic small talk with people, and as far as my friends are aware, I'm fine now. But I still have this lingering sadness and tiredness from before and it is eerily  similar to those feelings I had in grade school and high school. Although those were based primarily in anger. This is more based in sadness. 

But here is the thing, I have no idea if I have what could be called ""depression"" or if I'm just having trouble getting over what happened that semester. My family always held this belief that sadness was something you can power through. I can remember my dad saying to me in sixth grade ""Knock it off, you are not depressed or sad, stop using it as an excuse"" and that has always kind of stuck. So I've always kind of ascribed to that philosophy even if it isn't true for everyone. I read stories of people dealing with abuse and ridicule by the masses and I really don't have something to really compare with those stories. In addition, the symptoms they give are almost debilitating. I'm not debilitated in anything really. I guess I've always considered it, ""Oh, I'm not that bad, don't compare yourself.""

But I'm also concerned about getting it treated. I don't know if I can afford some kind of medication if needed and I don't want to put a financial burden on my family with therapy (I remember the therapy I had in sixth grade was a point of contention in my family because of cost) I'm also unsure if they will just say ""oh your just bummed out a bit. Go for a walk"" and I will just be wasting my time. 

and again there is the fact that my family does tend to over react a bit to me being sad about anything, perhaps back to those times in grade/high school. For example, I posted a less than happy facebook status that said I had a pretty awful homecoming and I was sick of school. I got a phone call from my grandparents asking if I was okay and if I needed help, My mom texted me suggesting I should probably transfer (As a senior one semester from graduating and with a brother who is struggling to finish school). I appreciate their concern, but I don't want them to panic about me. Hence why I'm asking here. 

I apologize for the wall of text and the incoherence of it all. It's been a complicated subject for me and I figured this was one of the better places on the internet to ask. I will be happy to clarify any questions you may have and any advice would be great. Thanks for reading.

16v5t8,5,2013-01-19,I screwed Freshman and Sophomore year of high school terribly. What are the chances I can get into a good college if I do better?,[deleted],DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/16v5t8/i_screwed_freshman_and_sophomore_year_of_high/,"Hi,

Recently I had a change in my intentions. From being extremely lazy, and extremely non-productive to being energetic and motivated. 

Freshman year of high school went terrible. I failed like 4 classes. 
Sophomore year, the first semester went totally downhill. But starting around the second semester of sophomore year, I started to do better; and I will continue to do better in Junior and Senior.  I've been taking extra curricular actives, and I'm in an intern in a hospital. Will that help me in the long run in applying for a decent college? 

P.S. I'm trying to avoid a community college as much as I can now. "

Call Congress, schedule meetings, tweet at them... they heard the thunderclap of the Internet last year, and they will hear it again.
 |Spread the word: Tweet. Post on Facebook. Dust off your Google Plus. Get on a soapbox. Tell your friends and family. We need more people to know about the issues and our efforts.
 |[Here's a page](https://www.eff.org/helpout) with a bunch of ways you can help!
[Do you think efforts like SOPA will come back anytime soon, or are they done for good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zak9r?context=5)|The same private interests behind SOPA and PIPA are using international policy venues like trade agreements and the UN's World Intellectual Property Organization to export the same kinds of abusive copyright enforcement laws to the rest of the world.
 |The major fight right now is the [Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP\\)](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp), a secretive trade agreement being negotiated between 11 countries around the Pacific region. The threat is that this agreement is being discussed completely behind closed doors, and we only know what's in it based upon leaked text. It has 26 chapters but the one we're concerned about is the one covering intellectual property, which rewrites global rules on enforcement that would turn ISPs into Internet cops, enact criminal sanctions for copyright infringement, and escalate protections for digital locks on content.
 |For folks in the US, [go here](https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8229) to take action and demand that your elected representatives call for a hearing on these secretive negotiations that would trade away your Internet freedoms.
 |If you're outside of the US, you can sign this [Stop the Trap Petition](http://stopthetrap.net) to send let government leaders and trade representatives know that you oppose any provisions in TPP that would criminalize or otherwise restrict the use of the Internet. 
[Simple question - What is the next big threat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zaklw?context=5)|We just published a blog post a few minutes ago about the top five issues we're going to face this year and what people can do about them. You [can read it here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/year-after-sopa-look-next-five-battles-internet-freedom).
[Also: If there was some big Anti-Video Game movement (since they still try to blame violent gun crimes on games\), would you be against it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zaklw?context=5)|As far as video games go, if there was a movement to ban certain types of video games that are traditionally protected by the First Amendment then we will — of course — be on the front lines protecting free speech. [Here's a great blog post](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/warning-exposure-video-game-labeling-laws-may-be-hazardous-freedom-speech) we wrote a few months ago about video game labeling laws and the First Amendment.
[How do you feel about Anonymous's actions to legalize DDosing as a protest act?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zampy?context=5)|Not sure what 'actions to legalize' you are referring to, but you may be talking about the White House petition that has been going around asking for this. We think that, in general, the White House petition site is not an effective way to go about getting change, and if you want any change in the computer crime laws (which are very much in need of reform), Congress is the best place to petition for that change.
 |But more broadly, when we are talking about protests, we think the best way to protest in favor of any Internet freedom issue is always to spread information about it to people who wouldn't normally hear it, and then contact your representative to tell them your vote depends on that change. The SOPA blackout day proved that this is a highly effective method of bringing about good results.
[Thanks for the reply, which really surprised me.  I don't think that Jeffrey Rosen bloke listens to people on Twitter but I donate to you guys monthly and always give you a decent slice of my HiB payments. Keep up the good work :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zbrqw?context=5)|I sure do listen to people on Twitter.  THQ was actually not the first time EFF was replaced in a bundle, for instance in Humble Indie Bundle 4 or the Humble Botanicula Debut.  Sometimes the developers would simply prefer a different charity, although I could see how EFF in a bundle with DRM would be awkward.
[What's a good EFF elevator pitch for non internet natives?  IE: If my aunt asks me what the EFF is good for I say...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zb5hw?context=5)|This is actually a common issue at parties or around my family, who still don't get what I do...
 |The [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/about) is an organization that protects your civil liberties in the digital age. Any time freedom of speech, privacy, or innovation is threatened online—which is often as corporations exert their undue influence and governments repeatedly prove they don't understand the Internet—EFF is there to fight back.
 |Or, like, EFF defends the Internet.
[How likely is it that something like SOPA could come back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zb0mj?context=5)|Right now, luckily, we scared Congress so much with the SOPA blackout, we're not likely to see legislation like SOPA anytime soon. We've heard from Congressional staffers their bosses are constantly (and nervously) asking ""Is this the next SOPA?"" when weighing Internet legislation.
 |But that does not mean the content industry is giving up. Soon, they'll be implementing their ""six strikes"" plan — or as we like to call it, [""The Copyright Surveillance Machine.""](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/us-copyright-surveillance-machine-about-be-switched-on) They also have been busy pushing for excessive [copyright treaties like TPP](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp) to try to push harsh IP laws in other countries. So it's important to stay vigilant against copyright issues because you never know where they are going to crop up next.
[Are there any particular issues that you believe the American public should be more aware of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zapsb?context=5)|Secret law. The government [has been heading in a disturbing direction](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/new-year-new-fisa-amendments-act-reauthorization-same-old-secret-law) where they've been keeping their interpretation of public laws secret, and refusing to release legal opinions on important subjects like the Patriot Act, FISA Amendments Act, and targeted killing of Americans overseas.   Domestic drones - keep your eye on this issue, it should gain much more attention in Congress this year. Police departments all over the country have started buying surveillance drones which they want to start flying over US skies soon. The privacy dangers are unprecedented, and the law has not kept up with the technology, so we need to get Congress to pass safeguards ASAP.  We've detailed some of [the biggest battles we expect to fight](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/year-after-sopa-look-next-five-battles-internet-freedom) in the next year, and the American public should certainly be aware of those.
[What can redditors do to further help your cause?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zapsb?context=5)|One important way to help the cause is to stay on top of the issues and take action when we've identified an area where it's necessary. I'll admit this is plug, but following [our blog](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks) or [newsletter](https://www.eff.org/effector) is a good way to do that, as is following us on Twitter, Identi.ca, Facebook, or Google+.
[Considering the Obama administration came out against SOPA (but for many of its provisions\), what do you think of the fact that he signed ACTA before SOPA was even in the news, and to what extent do you believe ACTA may be a threat to online freedom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zb2i6?context=5)|Despite our success defeating SOPA last year, the content industry's grip on our elected representatives is still firm. ACTA is part of a long line of trade agreements that carry expansive copyright provisions that were put there through the heavy lobbying influence of Hollywood and other major content publishers. Just like Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is the current major fight on the international front, it was negotiated in complete secrecy with no democratic oversight. Fortunately, years of advocacy by digital rights organizations worked, and we were able to get them to remove some of the worst provisions in the agreement, and now it looks a lot like the US Digital Millenium Copyright Act.
 |While ACTA was victoriously defeated in Europe last Summer, there are still some indications that it may live on for the rest of the signatory countries. If ACTA goes into effect—and this is true for all trade agreements we sign on to—it will make it that much harder for us and other signatory countries to reform their domestic copyright laws in the face of these supposed ""international standards"" of intellectual property. 
[We're fucked, aren't we?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zb63r?context=5)|No.
[What are in your opinion the next great battle for the internet? How do you feel about Anonymous and what they do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zakom?context=5)|There will probably be more fights about Internet freedom — whether it's privacy, patents, copyright, free speech, or computer crime law — in 2013 than there ever has been. We [just published a blog post a few minute](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/year-after-sopa-look-next-five-battles-internet-freedom) ago that answers this question and identifies the top 5 issues SOPA activists should focus their attention on this year.
[Did you guys see the leaked zero dark thirty?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zarq8?context=5)|Nope. Happy cake day.

Do you have any internships or similar opportunities for students?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16tu47/one_year_ago_today_you_help_us_beat_sopa_thanks/c7zb3yu?context=5)|You can find out about opportunities here: [Link to www.eff.org](https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/)
[Thanks for your support. You guys are helping protect the last real frontier.

All of us are pretty plugged in to Congress. We judge when to run a campaign against bills when they become seriousness enough for passage. Because of certain rules in Congress (like announcing hearings a week before, or filing bills with a 24 hour heads up), we tend to have time to weigh our resources, the seriousness of the bill passing, and then figure out what to do about it.

16v3yd,0,2013-01-19,Taking a year off before going to grad school?,[deleted],geology,https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/16v3yd/taking_a_year_off_before_going_to_grad_school/,"I'm a junior-level geology major and still have 3 semesters including this one to go. Currently my GPA is 3.65, and I've made 6 A's and one B in my geology courses. I'm starting to feel hesitant and confused about my graduate school choices. I have a very heavy interest in geophysics.

My #1 choice is Berkeley, but for one of their [courses](http://seismo.berkeley.edu/~manga/eps236/eps236.html) I noticed that it requires pre-knowledge of differential equations and Calculus III. I haven't taken either of those as an undergraduate and I'm sure I won't have time before it'd be time to go.

If I wait a year while I study those on my own and take internships, would my chances for getting in be lower than if I applied straight out of college?

It also kind of makes me uncomfortable that I wouldn't be able to get a master's there...I'm also worried about income. Right now as it is I can't even afford a car, and one of my professors said that western geology schools have really long waiting lists, with one student having to wait a whole year before one opened up at the University of Arizona. Supposing I'd get one of them my first semester, how would I pay my tuition in the interim?

During the year off, would it be worth moving wherever a year in advance to lower tuition rates by $15,000? Then again, I might not even get in...

tl;dr I'm just worried about uprooting myself from the east coast all the way to the west coast or wherever and finances. Maybe I'm thinking too far ahead."

16v13u,3,2013-01-18,"The First ""Hunt""",Keelan13,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16v13u/the_first_hunt/,"Like many people, I’m a fan of the TV series *Supernatural*. I was actually fortunate enough to intern as a college student doing script coverage for Warner Bros. when Kripke was trying to get the pilot picked up and got to read a few early drafts of the first script; so it goes without saying I was a fan [technically] before there even was a series.

But people, please…stop with all the rock salt solutions to everyone’s problems. Yes, salt has its place among items to be used, but it isn’t a preventative measure and it certainly doesn’t apply to 90% of what the masses seem to think.

=ahem= Anyway, as I was starting to say: I have all the seasons on DVD, the comics, the novels (those that have been released, anyway; others I have pre-ordered), have worn a replica of Dean’s old amulet every day for the past 6 years, and even have the RPG books, though I’ve never played a session. So it should come as no surprise that, considering my fondness for the show plus my already lifelong interest in the paranormal and occult, I started to write my own Hunter Journal.

For the most part, this is filled with information on different topics, rather academically. Histories and theories behind different spirits and creatures, different ways in which to protect oneself, and basically anything that would come to be found as helpful should such things ever be encountered. Of course, it wouldn’t be complete without a few entries of personal experiences, so I’m going to share some of them with you, much like I started to with my previous entry (“A Childhood Memory” http://redd.it/15uiuk ). There’s an occasional use of colorful phrases (much like Dean, I’m a natural smartass and pretty great at it when it counts), so just roll with them when they happen.

When I was around 12 or 13, I met a kid named James, who very quickly became one of my best friends. We got along well right off the bat. It didn’t take me long to notice there was a little bit of unease to the dude (I’m definitely an introvert, and one thing we’re good at is noticing human behavior and picking up on patterns and other little things most don’t see), and at some point he started to talk to me about having seen things in the condo that he and his family were living in.

One thing he described was a pair of green eyes looking at him from through an air-vent high up on the wall in his bedroom. Now, knowing me, I probably made some smartass joke, but once James didn’t react I knew he was being serious. So we started talking about it all some more. He told me about a time he hopped over the back of the couch to land on it and watch TV… and the couch moving so he dropped to the floor instead in a reverse belly-flop. My mind started to analyze things (yes, even at that young age I was quite the nerd; learn to love it), trying to figure out what was scaring my new friend, and what I could do to stop it. I’ve always been a bit of a “Peter Parker” like that, so I always help someone who needs it if I can, and this seemed an important time that I happen to have that trait. Feeling that I needed a little more verification than “I think *this*,” James and I opted to get a little more information.

Without knowing it, Doc and I (“Doc” is a nickname I’ve called him for many years now, so just keep it in mind they’re the same person in case I switch back and forth during the rest of the story) were about to have a serious meeting with some *thing*.

His mother was alone at the condo watching a Godzilla marathon or something, so Doc and I seized the opportunity to go to the local library. We found a small selection there dealing with ghosts and spirits and hauntings and all other aspects of parapsychology. After looking through about half of them, one of us came across a book primarily about Poltergeists. A good deal of what was mentioned in the book regarding the behaviors of poltergeists and what Doc said was going on happened to fit almost perfectly. Add to that the fact that he had three younger sisters, and two of which were about to approach puberty; this coincided with the theory connecting energies of such developmental events and the spirits, so we felt we had enough evidence to make a positive ID.

Skimming through the book some more, we found a chapter talking about ways to confront and banish the spirit, mostly through equalizing the energies stored within the home environment. Armed with knowledge and now a means to strike, we decided to waste no time and went into action (what can I say but we were young and foolish).

We knew immediately that something was off when we got back to the condo.

For starters, the place was wide open. I mean the front door, gate to the back, garage door and the door from the garage to the kitchen, all open. Doc’s family had two huskies (Gambit and Wolvie) that would have been running around the area like crazy…but they were nowhere to be found. Inside, the condo was empty. No person was there, which caught us off guard as we expected his mother to still be there. Most electronics were on; lights, the microwave, the TV (which was picking up white noise but no sound) and a radio somewhere upstairs.

Doc went upstairs to turn off the radio, also closing the front door while he was at it. I opted to close up the garage area. Leaning in at the kitchen door, I pressed the switch to shut the rolling door and heard a thump! from next to me. One of the knives from a kitchen drawer (now open when it wasn’t before) was stuck in the door frame next to my hand; far enough not to have posed a risk, but close enough to send a clear message.

I just didn’t care what this thing had to say. “Honey badger don’t give a shit” mentality going on there.

When Dog got back and we turned everything off, we decided to look room-by-room, starting upstairs. Other than the silence of the place, nothing seemed off upstairs; not visually, anyway. So we proceeded to look downstairs, with the same result. James wanted to look into where the dogs may have been, so he opened the sliding door from the living room to the back (which was also the only door that remained shut when we first arrived) to find two dead sparrows on the mat outside, facing each other. This seriously had him freaked out, for a few reasons:

a)	The dogs would have chewed the shit out of the birds if they were around.
b)	There were two of us and two birds; symbolism is sorta in your face on that one.
c)	The way they were placed on the mat was too aligned for it to have been done any way but intentionally.

We braved the situation and looked about the back. Zero signs of what may have happened or where the dogs may have gone to.
Through the blinds of the room upstairs that doc and his uncle shared, he saw what looked like the silhouette of a person standing in the room looking down at us. I told him “don’t take your eyes off it” and bolted back into the house, up the stairs and into the room. Nothing was there, so I went to the window to open the blinds to see if James saw anything move. Nothing had, he told me.

James was so scared at this point that he just wanted to leave. We went back to my house so he could calm down and so we could figure out our next move. It took a while and some convincing, but he finally got himself together enough to go back. When we got there we were greeted by his mother, who apparently hadn’t left that day. In fact, she had been recording the movies on VHS and had to manually pause the recording to edit out the commercial breaks. The dogs were also present and just fine, for those wondering. :P

I don’t remember what it was Doc decided to try from the book in the end, but things sort of stopped after that. What I do remember is that shortly after Doc told his step-dad (who was a relatively faithful Jehova’s Witness), the family up and moved. Whatever it was didn’t follow them, and as far as I’ve been able to observe with my occasional trips through my hometown, hasn’t been active at the condo either.

Not sure if that means the first “hunt” was actually a success or not, but at least it didn’t turn into a total train wreck, right? Clusterfucks right out the door are sort of a bad way to start off your record.

Now at this point in time, we’ve obviously gotten older and acquired a fair deal more of knowledge. When first writing this entry into my journal, I started to look closer at all the events that happened. Looking back at the behaviors of what we encountered, I [finally] started looking at those that didn’t fit what poltergeists were known to do, rather than only giving attention to those that nearly perfectly fit…I’m no longer so convinced what we encountered was a poltergeist after all."

16uu9b,49,2013-01-18,Losing weight did nothing for me.,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/16uu9b/losing_weight_did_nothing_for_me/,"M/21 here. Since I was six years old, I was a fatty - manboobs, stomach, rolly arms and legs, you name it. It got worse and worse as I progressed through middle and high school, and really took a toll on my social life. I never asked girls out, always was the quiet guy in the group since I didn't want to be noticed, wore jackets during the summer to hide my flab. I wasn't bullied or anything, but I hated myself.

In college, I worked hard to lose the weight - about 75 pounds -  and now I am in good shape. I still have a bit of stomach but most of the fat has turned to muscle. But the damage wrought on my social life has never healed. I've yet to ask a girl out, let alone kiss one or have sex. I have fat scars that run so deep and so long down my torso/sides/back that it looks like Dr. Frankenstein stitched me together from dead skin. I always tug at my shirt in public or pull up my pants even though it's unnecessary; I think maybe only fat people will really understand what I mean when I say that the level of paranoia and self-consciousness is overwhelming. It physically exhausts me.

The worst part is, nobody but my parents knows. I'm a social guy, the life of parties. I'm short but I make up for it by being interesting and funny. I plan to go to medical school (losing weight is a big reason for this decision) next fall. I've done internships with world renowned political organizations in New York and DC. People think I have my shit together - but I don't, not beyond a superficial level. I hate myself for being a virgin and I've started to become resentful of people who aren't virgins because it reminds me of how I've ""fallen behind"". In the mornings, I'll try on three different t-shirts and examine them in the mirror before I'm okay with my attire for the day. During class, I'll shift in my seat every few seconds because it feels like my ass is hanging out of the chair.

I think girls can sense this extreme loneliness and bitterness because noone has ever shown an interest in me, despite me trying to be talkative and interesting at social events. I leave every mixer, every party, every gathering, every group dinner feeling unloved and alone. My parents don't understand because they were raised in a super conservative culture and don't get the concept of relationships before marriage. I have nobody to turn to.

I thought losing weight and being healthy would change things, but it's only caused me to become even more stressed, resentful and bitter. Fuck. I spent so many days and nights in the gym... I used to work out for 2-3 hours nonstop. And for what? I should have just kept eating and gotten fatter.

I need someone who understands."

So I've known my SO for 3 years now. I met him while we were both in other relationships and I was in his area visiting friends. Due to that, our friendship always wanted to be more, but we couldn't for a ton of reasons. We went through all three years trying to fight our feelings for one another and even broke each others hearts a few times (LDR's are hard!). After all that, we FINALLY got on the same page a couple of months ago and are so crazy about one another. It's the best feeling ever!

Anyway, we've always been living in different places but I have seen him in person a few times. But I haven't seen him in about two years. This is where everything is aligning. Our year right now is getting to be amazing! I am going to see him over my spring break, AND I am 92% sure I have an internship in his area for ALL SUMMER, and THEN I found out that my team is playing at his school for one of our tournaments a few months into the fall semester.

Wow. It's honestly the most amazing feeling ever to know that I'll get to see him consistently throughout the year. I just had to tell somebody! Especially because he has no idea about my team coming to his school yet. =)"

My grandma had suffered a stroke and had been placed in the hospital. Great.  Class started around the seventh and my funds were low because of unemployment, so I was unable to make it home (typical college broke-ass). Because of that, I endured about two weeks' worth the worry without seeing her. Though it was hard to come by, I finally scored some money around Wednesday and drove down. Since I arrived at the hospital she's gotten progressively worse (non-responsive, vegetative state). Since everything about her health went south, we decided to stop all treatment two days ago-- so I've just been here with my family watching one of my favorite people in this world die. It's been tearing me apart. It's been tearing all of us apart. 

My grandma supported me no matter what I did, but she was especially proud of me for going to college. Well, I  received a phone call earlier from one of my university's research centers... I scored a paid internship. The pay isn't great, mind you, but it will give me a huge leg up for grad school and a full time employment opportunity post-grad. Just told my mom, and she freaked. She's so happy. But I. Am. Stoked. 
SO STOKED.

By my grandma's bed right now, and all I can think about is how happy she'd be for me. I'm really going to miss that. God, she spoiled me rotten. And though this is super hard to watch, I'm staying with her until the end. 

Thanks for believing in me and giving me that push when no one else did, Grandma. I love you.

16yb8n,44,2013-01-20,I [F21] don't know how to break up with boyfriend [22M],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16yb8n/i_f21_dont_know_how_to_break_up_with_boyfriend_22m/,"We've been together for over 5 years, living together for almost 2 years.

TL;DR: Don't know how to move forward with feelings of wanting to break up because we live together, he depends on me, and moved here to be with me.

In august of 2011 my boyfriend left his hometown and moved in with me so we could be together after being long distance. Since then, I've felt like our relationship is just slowly declining. 

We started having sex less and less, things I used to think were hilarious are now not remotely funny and sometimes annoying, and while I used to love spending time with him I'm now dying to have  more and more alone time. 

Lately I just haven't been feeling *in* love; I no longer like how serious my relationship is and I'm tired of always having to make plans while considering someone else. Over the summer I was away on internship and I loved doing what I wanted, when I wanted and just being on my own, for the first time really. I was gone for 3 months and I didn't miss him as much as I think I should've. I thought maybe that because I needed more space that after some time apart I'd be happy for us to be back together but really I just missed the freedom. 

The other issue is that while I'm feeling like this, he's doing everything he can to make me happy. He's a great boyfriend, I don't know why it's not enough which is why I feel so terrible.

I really think that a break up is best but my main issues with how to do it are: 

* we both have individual leases for this apartment until August and could not find a subletter until May
* he uses my car to get to and from work 
* he moved down here to be with me and hasn't really invested much here so if we broke up I'd imagine he'd want to leave and then I feel like I just wasted the last 2 years of his life
* he says he couldn't be happier and has absolutely no idea I feel this way and I hate that I'd have to completely blindside him. 

I know I have to do it soon because he keeps talking about signing our new lease and I can't ask him to do that while I'm feeling like this, but how do I do it now while we're still living together? There's no breaking the lease, and like I said there's no way to get a subletter until summer. If we break up, he'd basically have to move back home because, unless we're living together, he can't really support himself here and I feel like that's such a horrible thing to force someone into.

I like to meet people and well money is something I wanna make. I know it won't come easy and that I'll have to bust my ass to get where I want to be. But my **main** question is: Do certain university programs really make a difference?

I'm researching at the moment and a university that I've been wanting to go for a long time has a pretty good program, TCU (Texas Christian Uni) for those wondering. However I recently discovered that a university not too far from my home has a much better program according to [this](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-15/the-complete-2012-business-schools-ranking#r=lr-sr) Southern Methodist is ranked 25 while TCU is ranked 46. 

 As everyone I want the best chance to get hired for a good job. I know that I will have to intern and get as much experience as I can and I know I will have to make connections. So should I go to the more expensive school?

I know it's a dumbass question, but I'm just lost at what to do so hopefully I can get a clearview after some opinions. I'm the first of my family to attend college so I don't really have anyone to get advice from in my family and I don't know much about universities, yet, to be honest with you. I just got out of the military so I know I will have to bust my ass and I'm ready. "
16yais,3,2013-01-20,I'm a graphic designer who would like to eventually work as a UI Designer for video games. Any advice on the industry?,Verb_Rogue,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/16yais/im_a_graphic_designer_who_would_like_to/,"I graduated a year ago with a degree in graphic design. My program was very strong in its focus on user centered design, focusing on process and user experience. It seems like the majority of internships and jobs I've had since I've started down this path have either be heavily print based, or if they are digital, their focus is on web design or app design for devices.

While these are all great, and aspects of design I enjoy, I've wanted to work as a designer in the gaming industry (in any capacity, but probably as a best fit doing UI design) and I'm not really sure how to get into the industry. It seems like all of the big companies are in major capital cities or over seas (I'm in the U.S.) but I feel like there has to be a need for UI designers at smaller start-up, kickstarter type places.

Interview, or meeting? So a classmate referred me for an internship with a local attorney he is close friends with.  I emailed the guy my resume, and he called me the next day asking about availability and whether I liked legal research.

He seemed very positive and told me that his previous interns have found jobs in the region after interning for him, and ""we'll see if we can get you in somewhere."" Then he told me to come in to meet with him on Monday.  I don't know if it is a second interview, or just a meeting.

Writing Sample - I struggled with the switch to *legal* writing for awhile.

16y5dy,10,2013-01-20,"The need to feel autonomous, and the urgency of one-upping others",[deleted],infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/16y5dy/the_need_to_feel_autonomous_and_the_urgency_of/,"The premise of this post roughly follows the thread on [""missing out""](http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/16rdp1/anyone_else_feel_like_theyre_missing_out/) also currently on the front page of this sub, but one thing I have trouble with is falling into periods where I feel as though I have to have the final word over my friends with regards to who's the most cognizant of what they're doing.

Sometimes I fall into this positive feedback loop of not knowing whether or not I actually enjoy something, or if it's just out of the pretense of acquiring prestige or impressing others. Many projects which I thought I started just for myself, sometimes reach a point where they interest other people and then I don't trust myself to continue, thinking that my original intention has been compromised and I'm just trying to please them now.

I also sometimes hate it when other people try and take too much of an interest in what I'm doing, because then I feel as if they think they know better - and maybe they do, but I know I ought not care what their opinion is on the matter. Sometimes they'll start doing similar things, and I feel as if I have to be critical of them or constantly talking big about my own experiences on the matter just to give a sense that I'm still relevant with regards to the topic at hand. A friend of mine recently started modding a game I've been modding, and I almost feel as if he's just enjoying this crude, voyeuristic mimicry for the sake of trying to impress me. And then I find mysel stressed out, seemingly working on my project less for myself and more to put him in his place.

In a slightly more relatable example, I hate when people make general observations which I've known for ages and feel have no reason to be stated aloud. From those kids in courses who ask questions that are really just clarifications/agreements with what the teacher said for the sake of talking to them, to people complaining about a current event when I've previously written entire rants about that event - then I feel as if I have to have my sentiments known as well, so that they know they aren't completely profound in their discoveries.

Similarly, I have interests in both art/design and writing. I find I emphasize artwork more around other writers, and around people who do artwork I like to exclude myself and present myself as more verbally-oriented, perhaps to avail myself that opportunity to continue presenting myself as a spectator and not a person to be scrutinized to the same standards as everybody else in the group.

I really hate doing stuff like that, as it's just another obstacle in my trying to be honest with what I want to work on. I generally am fairly easygoing and do not do this, but when I'm stressed out I seem to lean more towards this tendency for outspoken criticism and dismissiveness. I believe I've read before that INFPs can sometimes surrender themselves to their inferior functions (such as thinking), which generally does not bode well.

I think I do it due to a sense of lagging behind - that there are people who seem to think far less than we do, and have far less diverse interests, and yet seem to just be leisurely perambulating through life with girlfriends and internships whilst I still haven't figured out what I really want to be known by - or if perhaps I'm one of those people who revels in being well-rounded and never doing one thing for too long. I almost feel as though it's the only way to continue to make myself feel relevant in the eyes of others, by alluding to awareness of things that they don't and always being just out of reach from being understood or caught up to fully.

I'll end this little tirade here as I'm not entirely sure what I hope to get out of it, and it's somewhat disorganized. I just wanted to compose my thoughts. So I suppose the question I ask to the others on this subreddit is, do you also sometimes feel as though you have to always have an ""advantage"" over others, or find yourself annoyed with people trying to fully understand you? Perhaps it stems from a need for a sense that one always must do things their own innately unique way, but when the mentality arises that one is too fundamentally different from others to ever be understood, I know that to be unhealthy and self-deprecating."

[Is it Penny's boat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800vmy?context=5)|I don't know a Penny, so probably not?
[It's a lost thing.  Not an actual question. But to make me seem like not a total time waster, besides reddit, what do you do to keep yourself entertained?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8011dh?context=5)|Well for the first week and half or so we were in transit to our first buoy. So that was rough, i had infinite time to do whatever. There is a bench out on the fantail that I like to sit on and watch the flying fish do their thing. I can normally kill an hour or so out there at any given time. I also brought The Illiad and The Odyssey and I have been reading that. Every now and then I'll help launch a weather balloon.
 |But since we actually got to the buoy I have been relatively busy, taking samples and what not. And we are there to recover and replace the buoys, which takes about 10 hours so there are always parts of that process that are fun to watch.
[What do the buoys do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c806fnn?context=5)|They record basic measurements like air-temp, wind speed, precip, sea surface temp, salinity, etc. These get beamed back to land to watch out for hurricanes and such.
 |The buoys track the basic parameters like air temp, wind speed, precip, humidity, sea surface temp, salinity, etc.
[So you're all within the realm of meteorology? What other sciences get to go out on boats? I figure marine biology would be one...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80h6fm?context=5)|There are oceanographers here, engineers, chemists, and meteorologists. As there are no animals be researched, marine biology is not one of them.
[What is your role on the ship? Research or crew? Both?  And proof. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzq51?context=5)|I am research, doing the above work. As for proof, is there a way to upload a picture on here that isn't like a link to an imagur host? I am kind of new to reddit.
[Ah, can you explain roughly what your research is?  No, it needs to be an imagehost.  Snag.gy is a site where you can print screen right into, cut the image and hit save. The link is postable here. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8004rf?context=5)|I am with a group of scientists that have a variety of jobs. One group is doing some aerosol work (the kinds of particulates in the air, how big they are, and to what abundance), another group is here to recover and replace an array if bouys that monitor basic weather conditions for the area, and I work with the group collecting water samples along the way.
[I think you might be on the boat that my boyfriend will be boarding in a few weeks for his own cruise. He just told me where it is now and what's happening, and your stories line up... quite nicely. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8058q8?context=5)|Interesting, where is he slated to go?
[That is facinating.  Where do you guys ship out from? Are you an international crew? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8009sq?context=5)|The ship I think is ported in Charleston, SC? I am not 100%, though. The crew is not international, but the buoys we are servicing are owned by the US, Brazil, and France. Or at least the program that put them out there is run by them.
[Im not sure how you are connected with the politics of the project, but do you think that research is getting more and more international with less problems due to it being several countries involved?  What I am trying to ask is: Earlier on there seemed to be a problem with countries using research as a power play. Is that something you guys see anything of now, or is the research shared?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800fxd?context=5)|Well I can only give my very limited opinion. This array of buoys has been around for nearly a decade I think, so this particular venture is nothing new. The kinds of cruises like the one I am on don't typically have foreign scientists, but the hardware itself could be a multi-national thing. I don't think I really answered your question and I'm sorry, but I am not quite ""in the know"" on that one.
[Thats ok. I was just curious. It seems to me that if you don't know about it, it is probably less of a problem. If it was massive you would probably hear people moan about it.  Thank you for your time, sir/sirette. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800lb6?context=5)|Sir :) thanks for the questions.
[Have you seen any sharks or whales?? If so, what kinds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800lql?context=5)|No sharks, and I don't think whales are migrating in this area this time of year. I've seen some squid, mahi-mahi, tuna, and this one gull that got stuck on our ship too far from land that I named Petree. Oh and dolphins, and someone said they saw a loggerhead turtle.
[Is Petree still there? Is he ok? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800u72?context=5)|I haven't seen him in a few days :( there was a big storm a couple days ago and I think it may have blown him away.

[Is it frightening at all? Is this your first time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800ydi?context=5)|This is my first time (and I am the only one on board who hasn't been on a cruise before) and there have been a couple scary moments. About 3 hours after we left port, we ran fire, man overboard, and abandon ship drills. That was all well and good, but about 45 minutes later there was an actual fire! One of the 3 generators blew up! We almost turned around at that point, but they fixed it up.
 |And then just tonight, we have gotten into some higher winds and are we pitching pretty good. We had a series of strong pitches and I guess something got knocked loose, but the power went out on the whole ship. So that was terrifying. I had to remind myself that I wasn't on a plane and power did not necessarily equate to flotation. But we are up and running again, about 3 days from land!
[One of the biggest fears that I have is of being on a boat/ship out in a large body of water for an extended period of time.  The *idea of the* isolation and inability to leave the confines of whatever functioning piece of flotilla that would keep me above the vast depths of the ocean, without any land in site, almost sends me over the edge thinking about it.  Do you have any fears such as this?  Do any of the other crew?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80237m?context=5)|I imagine the crew forgot those fears a long time ago, this isn't their first rodeo after all. I was certain I would be a little scared of the isolation and the night, but so far I have surprised myself. The ship is state of the art, and I trust the crew explicitly. Although, I did have a panic attach my first week because I was seasick and just could not escape it anywhere on the ship. I feared I would go crazy from not being able to get away from the churning for the next 5 weeks, but that too, has passed.
[Bonine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80evfy?context=5)|Huh, i've never heard of it but ill look into it. ive been taking meclizin and phenogrin.
[What is it like being stuck on a tiny boat that long?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzz6t?context=5)|The first week was terrible. There was a huge low pressure system that kicked up some nasty swells. This is my first cruise, so I got pretty seasick. Since then I've been on some good medication so I have come to really enjoy the ride. It is strange to wake up to the same horizon every day, but I enjoy the company of the crew and the other scientists so that helps. 
[Do you think that Gravol would work for suppressing seasickness?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80648v?context=5)|I dont know what that is?
[What is your profession exactly that allowed you on the ship with the buoy guys? Do buoys ever get destroyed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8013fu?context=5)|I am intern kind of thing, I'm a meteorology student at Texas A&amp;M. The other scientists though are research scientists at various labs and Universities around the country.
 |Buoys can get damaged, or even vandalized. We recovered one yesterday that had a crack down the side, probably from a boat running into it. And we recovered one today that had some missing instruments, likely stolen by fishermen.
[Why would fisherman want to steal weather monitoring instruments? Aside from the obvious ""to monitor the weather"", I'm assuming they are relatively hi-tech and require a special understanding to either operate or extract data, so yeah, why take them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80c4cy?context=5)|Exactly, they may steal them to sell for parts. also, they could have just fallen off in inclement weather, but somehow i doubt that.
[How frustrating. Don't they know there's science happening?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8059xj?context=5)|They must, they know it will get replaced in a year so they can come back and steal some more.
[Can you fish off the boat or is there generally not much to catch where you are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzztt?context=5)|Well these buoys that we are servicing develop there own little ecosystems. They are the only things out there for thousands of miles, so fish hang around them. It takes about 10 hours to recover and replace a buoy, so we fish off the side. So far we caught a few tuna and a baby mahi-mahi. The tuna we sent up to the cooks for dinner, the mahi we threw back.
[When you replace the buoy, what do you do with the stuff scraped off the old one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c806hf5?context=5)|Throw it overboard, normally its just barnacles and stuff.
[Next time eat it! mahi mahi is delicious and theyre beautiful fish.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c807l5y?context=5)|We had a little mahi-mahi the first week, but it wasn't freshly caught. I've heard it's great though!
[What kind of research are you doing that requires you to be at sea so long?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzp00?context=5)|I am with a group of scientists that have a variety of jobs.

A couple days ago we had the huuuge storm kick up in about an hour. Completely out of nowhere. We watched it roll in and right over us around sunset, made the water turn red and bloody looking. It was very cool. I'll upload a pic if I get time.
[Op will deliver.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8084y9?context=5)|I updated with those pics.

[Who cooks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80grj5?context=5)|We have 4 full time cooks on board.

That is an a-frame used to pulley up heavy things that we are recovering from the ocean. I think that is what you are talking about.
[I was referring to the shape of the bow. It's kind of upside-down.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80gbx3?context=5)|I never posted a picture of the bow?

Best part of the trip so far has been the views, the sky is so big and you can just see all these storms develop without any obstruction. the worst was the seasickness i had the first week. suuucked!

We have to get to where we are going before the science can happen, so I have had nothing BUT free time for awhile. I only just thought about doing this tonight. I have my own stateroom, but I share a bathroom. And there is always somewhere on deck I can sit quietly if I need some fresh air.
[I dated a girl who worked on one of these vessels years ago. She emailed me that she had written me a letter and would post it when they reached the ""mail buoy.""  I guess the crew was having fun at her expense. Is this a known joke on these vessels? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c803beh?context=5)|Not that i am aware of, a mail buoy sounds a little sketch.
[What are the various ways in which computers and applications help you study the ocean? Are they developed in-house or do you ask vendors to develop them (hardware and software\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c802xhj?context=5)|We have a room just dedicated to our mainframe, keeping our computers up and running, satellites and what not. I don't know anything terribly specific as far as what hardware we have, but we use computers in almost all the science we do. They track the weather balloons we launch, the probes we drop in the ocean, and buoys we are tracking down. Computers help us analyze and compile the data for later use. I pretty much don't understand how we did science without them.

The Atlantic because that is where the buoys we are servicing are at. Now, because that is when we got funding to go. My average day consists of browsing the web, doing homework, reading, and occasionally working. That will change in a couple days when I will have a 12 hour shift. And I never make it up for breakfast, so unfortunately nothing.

We analyze them for oxygen and salinity concentrations throughout the water column. We can use that to calibrate buoys in the area and the values goes online for other researchers to access for their projects. Can't say where I am exactly right now, just tropical Atlantic.

[How do you and the other scientists on the ship balance work and play, so to speak? Is work around the clock or sporadic? What sort of activities are there when you're not working? Is the work itself any fun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c807gu2?context=5)|Well the first 10 days have been just transit for us, there hasn't been a whole lot of work to do. So we have all the time in the world to ""play"". When we get to where we are going, then we will have 12 hour shifts that have intermittent spurts of free time every 4 hours or so that give us some free time. We have to do something besides work every now and then or we would go bat shit crazy!
 |When we aren't working, I typically stick to my computer and read a book. I'll sit outside and watch the flying fish do their thing every now and then. When we get to a buoy we fish off the side of the ship, which is fun. The work itself is fun to me! Very hands on and science-y so I like that kind of stuff.

I've been doing some research on it, and on the software they list under the preferred requirements (Rational Rhapsody and DOORS), and I feel like I have a decent handle on it. If I understand it correctly, I would basically be responsible for figuring out the details of what software is supposed to do and figuring out how it's all linked together and all that sort of thing. Not quite to the level of UML modeling -- class design -- but definitely pushing in that direction. 
If I have the right idea about it, then I get the impression it would be a challenging, high responsibility job, and it sounds like it could be a great job. I just want to go in as informed as possible.

Back in the old days when you had to sign a patent application and physically file it an office, you would sign and date it but you would also write where you signed the document. For example, London or Munich or New York. It was important because then it was easier to work out what had happened between the application being finished and being filed.

Since about 2005 everything has been filed online and my dad has been a partner since that time also so it's been pretty challenging for him to lose his job. They kept the old form, but everyone just leaves it blank when asked where it was signed because it doesn't matter anymore, maybe some of the keen interns fill it in but that doesn't matter.

My dad on the other hand has spent 7 years writing ""I love you Jane"" in that space, Jane is my mum and his wife. In 7 years I estimate he's filled out or signed off thousands of patents and most of those will now be kept indefinetly. There is a permanent and hidden record of my dad's love for my mum which will one day be found by someone.

16xbkm,14,2013-01-20,"I [22] hooked up with a friend while my girlfriend [22] and I were broken up. This friend may be moving to my city, and my girlfriend is distressed at this thought.",throwitawaynow25,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16xbkm/i_22_hooked_up_with_a_friend_while_my_girlfriend/,"M22, F22, 2.5 years.

My girlfriend and I started officially dating around June of 2010, during which time I was away on an internship. During this internship, I forged a friendship with another girl (let's call her Tricia), for whom I have honestly never had any feelings: romantic, sexual, or otherwise. Despite this, my girlfriend was somewhat paranoid about my relationship with Tricia, partially due to my girlfriend's romantic history and partly due to me awkwardly and stupidly navigating the first part of my first serious relationship from across the country.

Now, I didn't know about my girlfriend's paranoia until almost 7 months later. We talked about it several times, and I tried to reassure her nothing was up with Tricia. However, those feelings of dislike toward Tricia never fully went away, but they never caused a huge problem since I only saw Tricia once or twice a year at conferences.

Fast forward to June 2012. I have broken up with my girlfriend for various reasons, and I'm single for the first time in 2 years. During this summer, I had little to no contact with women, as I was just chilling at my hometown before moving for graduate school. I did, however, go on a trip to visit Tricia and a couple other mutual friends whom I did not often get a chance to see. One night during this trip, mostly due to alcohol, but partially due to loneliness (and possibly an attempt to convince myself that I was single, as my ex and I had still been talking), Tricia and I made out and performed oral sex on each other. I regretted it a bit, but it was no huge deal at the time.

My girlfriend and I got back together in September, and we're now in a long term long-distance relationship. She knows about what happened with Tricia. She is upset whenever Tricia is brought up, but she says she doesn't want me to have to stop being friends with Tricia since I didn't do anything wrong.

I could just stop being friends with Tricia, but a couple of things complicate that. One, we are both professionals in the same field with many mutual friends and contacts, so seeing and talking to each other at conferences will be inevitable. Second, Tricia is applying to my grad school. Should she get in, she will know not only me but a few mutual friends with whom I regularly hang out. She would also most likely work in my lab. Avoiding her would be impossible.

This has distressed my girlfriend, and she claims that she doesn't want to feel this way. However, she claims that she ""hates"" Tricia and that Tricia is ""sneaky,"" despite the fact that she only met her once at a loud bar for less than 20 minutes. She says that while she trusts me, she is afraid Tricia will flirt with me, despite her long-term boyfriend that she recently got back with. Whenever Tricia's name, or even the name of the city in which we did our internship, is brought up, my girlfriend gets silent and moody for several minutes. I know it's eating away at her, and I try to be as comforting and understanding as possible, which she appreciates. However, I also often feel like she's not trying hard enough to let this go, especially when she goes so far as to villainize someone she doesn't know.

So, I'm at a loss. Is there a way I can help her get over this? Tricia is going to be a part of my life for a while, professionally if not personally, and I just don't know what to do to make my girlfriend feel better. I don't want my girlfriend to be hurt every time Tricia's name is mentioned, and if she goes to school with me... I don't even want to think about it.

**TL;DR: My girlfriend was baselessly paranoid about my girl friend. We broke up for other reasons, and I drunkenly hooked up with my friend while single. My girlfriend and I got back together in a LDR, and she's upset whenever friend is mentioned. My friend might be moving to my city and working with me.**

EDIT: I made this post as concisely as possible assuming you would take me at my word. I want to reiterate that I did **not** have any sexual feelings for this girl. It was purely a regrettable drunken one-night stand fueled by alcohol and a sudden lack of female contact for 3 months. Speculation that it was anything else is just that. Frankly, I find her unattractive. Secondly, it **will** be hard to avoid her if she comes here. I know maybe in your work/social environment that may be different, but I cannot fully explain the social dynamics here without rambling. Please just understand that she will most likely infiltrate my friend group here, and please help me with that assumption in mind."

16xagg,3,2013-01-20,I am quitting my job because of my anxiety.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/16xagg/i_am_quitting_my_job_because_of_my_anxiety/,"Just to give you a little background about me, I'm 28 and was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder in my teens.  My diagnosis eventually switched over to generalized anxiety disorder, but I still have OCD tendencies.  I believe I might have Asperger's syndrome but have not been assessed for it yet.  Last May, I completed my graduate coursework and became a certified school counselor.  During my graduate coursework, I was also a live-in resident director.  My life was very stressful but rewarding at the time, so I was able to keep pushing myself despite the anxiety I felt.  One of my professors, a psychologist, caught onto my self-esteem issues related to my anxiety and incorporated CBT into my internship evaluation.  It was very awkward and probably inappropriate, but he knew my anxiety was a roadblock to my success as a counselor.  As a school counseling intern, I struggled a lot to manage my anxiety, especially when meeting with students.  While I improved over time, I never felt comfortable.  I spent a lot of time sitting at a computer and did not reach out to students as I probably should have.

After I graduated, my anxiety spun out of control when I couldn't find a job.  I was able to get two interviews.  The first went well but I nearly suffered a panic attack during the second one.  I pretty much blacked out and my mind went completely blank.  This was a major blow to my already low self-esteem.  Eventually, I started applying for other jobs and landed one at a group home for adolescents.  It wasn't an ideal situation with excessive and odd hours, including overnights, but I took what I could get.  About a month ago, I was woken up (we are allowed to sleep during our shifts) to one of the residents pepper-spraying another right in front of me.  I had to call the police and have some really serious talks with both residents.  Then just a few days ago, when I was finally getting over the anxiety I felt from that incident, there were three incidents in a few hours.  All of them involved the residents screaming at one another and me.  My heart hasn't stopped beating fast since then and I made the decision that tonight will be my final shift.

To lessen my anxiety, I am simply quitting without notice and doing so by leaving a nicely-written, praise-filled letter with an explanation for my abrupt leave.  As much as it would be nice to have a recommendation, I am just too shakey to continue dealing with the residents.  I feel like one more incident will cause me to have a breakdown of some sort.  Still, I feel terrible having to leave like this, especially since I know coverage is minimal with one staff member on vacation and only two other counselors who already have 50-60 hour weeks.  But the thought of being here (even as I type this) is making me feel sick.  It is absolutely amazing how one day I can be fine and the next (after the most recent incidents) I am up all night and unable to sleep because the thoughts of something else happening are so worrisome.  So now I have to move out of my apartment, move back in with my parents, seek help (I have been struggling with ongoing depression that has only gotten worse with this anxiety), and start looking for jobs that are not related to counseling for the time being.  What a bummer to go through school and have massive debt just to learn I am not mentally capable of counseling.  Hopefully I can put the pieces back together and try again in this field, but I am unsure of what to do next.  Any advice is more than welcome."

My parents are both university graduates, they told me that they would have rather me gone back to school to study in order to get a better paying job. I did not heed their advice, and I worked for nearly 5 years in retail before deciding to go back to school for Business.

I was, by this time, 23, and single. I figured I'd take a course in Toronto, Canada to study a Business Course based in Fashion, because I worked in a shoe store for nearly 3 years. Being the stubborn young lady I was, I was determined to take a 2 year diploma, apply for University in London, UK and take a 3 to 4 year program on how to become a shoe designer. I was accepted, but never followed through. I stayed in Toronto, and finished up a 3 year program in Fashion Business.

I thought I loved what I choose, I thought that I would get out of school, push my way through and get a job in 2010 to 2011. No way. I worked my ass off, but I had no luck breaking into the Fashion Industry. I worked in various coordination positions (administrative, secretary type positions) when I was fired early from an 8 month contract that was only 3 months...

I took a long hard look at my life, and decided that corporations that dealt in finances (had a position within) and the fashion were not my thing. 

I did a few internships and got myself into the Music Industry.

This is wherein I am feeling lost. I'm not a musician. I sing, I used to write, I used to compose temporary classical pieces on piano, I used to play &amp; study theory on a Royal Conservatory level. I felt the pull from music again about 4 years ago when I was attending school for Business.

To make an even longer story short - I decided to try to take training in Tour Management (that means I'd ""babysit"" bands, and handle their day-to-day business transactions while touring while on tour across Canada or other countries) and see where that takes me on the advice of a CEO at a company I interned at. 

I feel lost, and stupid, and like I have no idea what I'm doing. None. Tour managing at 27? I feel like I paid my stupid dues, I have a damned business background, I'm better than starting from the bottom up. I work hard, and I'm smart, but I don't want to start from the bottom up in the Music Business Industry. 

I want to love what I do. I really, really, really do. But I have this stupid split personality of wanting to impress my parents, make money and love what I'm doing.

Please, give me all your advice. I need it, I need to be slapped a few times across the face with reality to get insight. I know I'm spoiled, I know I'm lazy... I just want someone to tell me to ""buck up"" in a profound way."
16x1lt,1,2013-01-20,(21M) Can't stop thinking about ex who cheated (21F),[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16x1lt/21m_cant_stop_thinking_about_ex_who_cheated_21f/,"This girl and I (let's call her Claire) met at uni freshman year and became friends soon after. We were inseparable as friends for a year, started to date at the end of our first year, and were in a wonderful relationship for a year after that, until the following summer. It was a very deep, intimate relationship and we were very comfortable and happy with each other. Unlike the previous summer (right after we first started dating), she and I were on separate sides of the country, and knew that we wouldn't be able to see each other, and were prepared to do long-distance. She had decided to leave home and take a psychology internship in Alabama where she knew no one. All was well (I thought).

All of a sudden, a few weeks into the summer, I received a phone call from her saying that she had hooked up with another guy. I was confused and hurt and broke up with her on the spot. She wanted to keep in touch over the summer and ""see where we were at in the fall"", I said no way. We didn't talk the rest of the summer, and she didn't try to salvage the relationship at all during this time. I checked her Facebook a month after - she ended up dating the guy she hooked up with over the summer (facebook official), basically forgetting about me completely, replacing me, or at least that's what it felt like. It was quite a traumatic summer for me - I cried many days and couldn't make sense of what she did.

Come the fall, she had broken up with the guy and wanted to get back together with me (crying, saying our relationship was really meaningful and that she made a huge mistake) or at least be friends. I said no to both - you can't cheat on me, forget about me, date the guy, and expect to get back together with me. But as the months go by (it's been about 8 months since the breakup) I still think about her every day and the wonderful relationship we had. I have hooked up with plenty of girls since her, but haven't found anyone I want to date, much less someone who could provide the deep connection we shared. It doesn't help that she wrote me a letter midway through the semester expressing how sad she has increasingly become over the course of the semester and how she still cares about me and has ""never stopped"".

I have no regrets - not about breaking up with her, not about refusing to be friends with her, I am proud that I was strong enough to do that. But I'm at a loss - how do I fully move on?

TL;DR: Ex who treated me badly is still on my mind."
16x0s9,9,2013-01-20,I can't control it anymore. My depression. My anxiety. My inevitable self-sabotage of relationships.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/16x0s9/i_cant_control_it_anymore_my_depression_my/,"How does everyone do it? From what I know, everyone experiences the same kind of reactions to situations I do but mine seems to be amplified. That or I just can't control it nearly as well.

I can't see a light at the end of the tunnel that is called life. I'm not talking about an afterlife. I am talking about life in general. The universe is entropic. Everything breaks down by randomness and chaos. Nature goes against entropy. When we are born, we are born into a struggle to go against entropy. But guess what? Eventually entropy wins. We die. Its over. There was no purpose. Or at least I can't see a purpose. I'm miserable, and its awful. Why should I work hard to get my engineering degree, apply for internships, stress out about how am I going to provide for myself for the rest of my life. All of this just so I can live a life like everyone else. Going to work, coming home. Being miserable.

Depression is awful. I am always extremely tired. Severely low on will power to do absolutely anything. I stop eating much. I am starting to stay in my room more and more. I get too anxious about leaving my bubble. I have always felt incredibly disconnected from my parents. I think it makes me want to latch onto other people for affection.

My social anxiety is awful. I feel incredibly insecure about myself. I feel detached from everyone. Most people can't see it. I can put on a pretty good face. I'm funny. I'm smart. I'm relatively likeable. But when I feel alone I just feel so incredibly and deeply alone. I feel like my brain kicks into an overdrive that amplifies my insecurities about everything. Why I am not getting as many girls in college as people portray college to be like. Why my roommate gets incredibly better grades than me, is extremely good looking, great with the guitar, better than me at video games, has a fantastically healthy relationship with a girl he loves.

So back to me. I have a girlfriend. Things were absolutely great the first few months. We spent most of the first semester in college together. We laughed, we spent hours talking, napping with each other. I took her on dates. I thought up very well done dates. She's amazing. I feel so lucky to be with her. I'm happy for once. Maybe I can stay that way. Hm.

 We go on winter break. She lives an hour away (a rather inconvenient distance). We hang out and she tells me how much she misses me. Eventually I have to leave with the family and go out of state. Once I get back she goes out of country with her family. Since I went out of state she has gotten worse and worse at texting. She's drifting away I can feel it. She gets back from her vacation. She's different. She still wants to be with me, and cares a lot about me. But I can tell her life has changed. Her priorities are different. I am lower, less impactful in her life. The percentage I have in her life is growing smaller and smaller. It pains me. I practically cry inside on a daily basis.

Damn it why do I have the need to be so attached to people. Im fucking worthless.

We talk it out and she just isn't interested in a relationship where we spend a lot of time together like I want. I understand that, but she is so flaky on things even like texting (like only text 4-5 times a day). It doesn't even feel like a relationship. We try and make a compromise. I know she's a great girl and when things go well I am really happy with her. But its not working out like I had hoped. When we stop hanging out my happiness with her begins to decrease. I slowly and slowly drip back into the festering of anxiety within my own mind. I can't take it. I want to release all my problems. I want to scream. I want to shatter a window. Just say fuck life and let it go to shit.

She's a good person, but... it's not just working out. I'm not asking for much. Just some attention. That's all. But the more I ask the more I feel insecure and I think she likes me less. Breaking up would just as awful. I think my depression would be too unbearable then.

It's already barely bearable. Life just ending seems so much better. I don't want to live life if this is how unhappy I am going to be for the rest of it. Don't worry. I know I need to keep at it before coping out and attempting suicide. I plan to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist during the week. Hopefully I can get my life back on track.

I don't know. Is anyone out there? How do I become happy? I just want to be loved."

But all of this seems really daunting, that I have to prepare so much in so little time. What I really want to know is: How do I find out about the different types of accounting jobs available and how do I pursue it? I'm taking accounting because I thought it's a more practical route than graphic design (a completely different route) and I love music and photography, but I have no idea if there are even accounting jobs that would somehow tie that in with my work. I would appreciate it if you could shed some light on how you think I'm approaching this, or if you have any advice."

We feel like our pros and cons for each balance each other out. This has been like this for the past month and it's what's making us hesitate about buying our tickets.

**April/May**

PROS:

* Weather will be nice
* cherry blossoms
* The trip won't be in the way of our possible internships

CONS:

* Golden Week (all the natives are out for break so everything's busy)
* We don't get to see our friends who are natives and has a lake house in Nojiri that we'd be able to chill at the last few days of our trip
* We'll have less time to save (not too worried about this though)

PROS:

* Festivals/Fireworks
* We'll have our native friends to take us around and give us the true Japan experience and to meet new people
* Lake house in Nojiri with native friends (mentioned in april/may cons)

CONS:

* Heat--The three of us are Asian and understand how crazy Asia is in the summer. The one that's set on Aug has been wanting to go to an Asian country (especially Japan) since she was a kid. We tried telling her how it is but to no avail. She also is riding on the fact that we'll have a good time regardless because we have our native friends (whom she is the closest to)
* Heat (So much humidity and heat we decided to put this here twice)
* 4 people means more hotel rooms because we heard they're small (+ sharing beds on a humid night...)

16wxia,1,2013-01-19,I'm interested in multiple positions at a small agency and I don't know how to approach them. Advice?,strange_cat,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16wxia/im_interested_in_multiple_positions_at_a_small/,"First off I'll give you some background about myself. I've just graduated 6 months ago with a degree in Economics. I want to eventually use it to do data analytics, preferably in a marketing setting. (I don't mind taking an entry level job and working into that field.)  I've had an internship in marketing, and I've also started my own music-related club at my university and managed to make a relatively large impact on the community. Right now I'm working as a retail manager. (woo)

There is a company (that focuses on music and events) I've been eyeing that has a great reputation in my area and I'm very interested in working for them. Right now there are no jobs that are applicable to my major.

The first job does not require a bachelors degree and is entry level. I would not mind taking it if I knew I would be able to grow at this company.

The second job does not necessarily require a degree, although it asks for some ""preferred"" skills that I dont necessarily have. I would like to have this job but im afraid of ruining my chances of working or this company by applying to something I dont have experience with. Although I'm sure it would pay much more than the entry level position.

The third choice I have is an internship in marketing. I've already graduated and have a marketing internship, but im very open to expanding my skill set, especially if this opportunity can set me onto the path of marketing analytics. (my last internship was not very strong) I have no idea what the hours are, or if it pays. 

So my dilemma is in contacting this company. Should I apply for one job and go to the interview asking them about other positions? Should I apply to all of them separately? Should I scrap the internship?  Or should I send an email to the company and tell them I'm interested *in general* and leave it up to them to decide where I fit in?"

I'm in school to get my BS in Dietetics, and last time I spoke to my advisor, he let me know that I was just a few easy courses shy of being able to get an Associates degree in personal training, as many of the nursing courses that  I'd started school with overlapped. I've been ""studying"" (very slowly, between full time work and full time school) for the NASM certification exam for a couple months now, and hadn't considered a degree to supplement it, as I'd been planning to get the certification for fun. 

Well, I just got word that the company I receptionist for may not be around in the next year or two, and am starting to look into personal training as a serious job. I have at least 2.5 more years before I get my dietetics degree, then the required internship following graduation.

So I'm looking at my Spring semester schedule, and wondering-- would it be worth it to use this semester to get the AA in personal training, putting off my dietetics degree by a semester, so that I have a job in the meantime? Or does an AA not help much, and I should I just plow on through with my dietetics degree?

The gym that I go to has their trainer's resumes on the wall, and many of them have AA's or bachelors. Is this necessary to get most jobs?

I'm sorry, I don't understand the field well yet, and was just kind of wondering what more experienced trainers would recommend.

I am older than the average student (24), so I don't have the luxury of having school as my full time job. Anyway, this semester I am worried about the difficulty of the classes that I am facing.

Intermediate Accounting 2 - not worried about this because of difficulty but because of how much time it may consume. Is it more difficult than Intermediate 1? I finished that class with an A, but I worked very hard for it. 

First Finance class - I have only had the lecture once and we went over the intro chapter, but this professor is notorious for being difficult. He says the best way to pass is to read the chapter before lecture and practice practice practice. Well, the only grades come from exams. So I read the chapter for next week and took notes. This chapter alone had over 30 different equations/ratios for financial statements. How is one supposed to memorize all of this? It's not that they don't make sense to me, but the sheer volume of them and having to memorize them for a test just seems absurd. I am praying that he tells us on Tuesday that we only need to know like 1/4 of them lol.

Those are the only classes I am really worried about. The rest of my classes are management (organizational behavior, should be a breeze), marketing (should be easy except group work that will be hard to schedule outside of class due to my hectic schedule), an internship course (pretty much done with the work required for this already), and income tax (we can use a cheat sheet for the exam so I am not concerned about this at all at this point).

So Reddit, which courses did you find the most difficult? Also, what were your finance and intermediate 2 classes like?"

* I’ve thought endlessly about contacting him, but haven’t.
* I hit the gym almost every day now.
* I am diving into my studies and working on my degree.
* I am surrounding myself with wonderful friends.
* I am focusing on my two jobs and saving money.
* I am meeting new people.
* I am seeing a counselor to try and help take care of myself.

When I'm 26 like her, perhaps I'll have accomplished as much as she has.  For now, though I'm doing alright.

This breakup is going to be a rocky road, but I cannot for ONE SECOND continue thinking that this woman is better than me or a reflection on myself.  I can miss him, and miss the good parts of the relationship, but comparing myself to her/them is only destructive.  

I need to love myself.  I’m the only one that can make me worthless, and I won’t let that happen again.”





I’m not sure if this would apply to any of you, but it was just something that I’ve been struggling with.  I thought maybe it could help.

I don't know how to handle all of this.",throwaway_098765,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/170ohb/xpost_from_radvice_was_already_feeling_very/,"Sorry this is a bit long.

I made a post about the break-up in /r/breakups [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16zfyv/my_now_ex_i_supposegirlfriend_just_ended_our/). I miss her like crazy and wish I didn't have to completely give her up. That there was some way we could still be friends, because I know we both want to. Some way to stop missing her, or feeling the way I do, so I could at least keep her as a friend.

But I guess that's not really the only point of this post...

I had already been feeling a little alone lately, because I just started  community college in the Fall, and I don't really have any friends that I actually see there. And I can't say I've really found anyone that I feel like I would actually ever hang out with outside of class, and since I'm going to school full time, and I'm working, I feel like I never have time to hang out with people anyways. And being with her always made me feel better. Even if I saw the break-up coming. She was my best friend, and the only person I was actually comfortable talking too. Having to cut her out completely makes me feel just so much more alone. And work is so mindless, all I ever end up doing is over thinking everything. Now I'm probably just going to end up thinking about her non-stop while I'm there.

I also feel like I have to figure everything out in my life right now. I'm in college, but I have absolutely no idea what I want to do. How do I even find out where to start? Hell, I'm only in school right now because I feel like I have to be. I have no over-all goal in being there. Maybe if I knew what I wanted to do, I'd at least have that to work towards. I hate all this pressure. What I really want right now, is figure out what I want to do, and just find an internship in it. Learn there on the job instead of going to school, because to be quite honest, I just kind of suck at school. 

I think the last thing that's really contributing to me feeling so overwhelmed is just time in general. I feel like I'm either at school, or at work. I never have time to myself, and when I do, it's either too late, or not enough time to really do anything with anyone. Plus they have different schedules than I do anyways. 

I honestly don't feel like I have any motivation to get up in the morning. If I didn't have to go to school or work, I probably wouldn't. I really have where my life has been, but I have no idea how to fix it. I feel powerless to really change anything, and incredibly alone, even though I know I have a few people I could talk to, I'm not really comfortable with anyone. I've always been such a closed person, I donno how to not be. I really just want someone to hold, and be together with through this.

Grad student here (MBA), working on completing the CPA exams.
I have internship experience but only with my tax professor(s)' small offices throughout my senior year, and about to get another internship (again via another tax professor) for this tax season. However, there's no promise of employment or anything like that. To me it seems temporary, and I have been promised part-time work until the end of tax season. I am mostly interested in working in Audit, as well. (Preferably Big4, or a large firm where I can learn and grow).

My prior boss mentioned to me once that changing my name may help open some opportunities for me in the business world. He suggested that  it could be the reason why I've been having a hard time getting call-backs or landing interviews. My first name is rather uncommon, and of Persian descent. My last name however, is a fairly common English (first) name. Although it's unusual, and my boss made sure not to offend me, I have been bouncing around the idea in my head. 

How many of you guys witness, whether consciously or unconsciously, avoidance of hiring people of Middle Eastern descent in the business world? I mean, I am still a student and trying to break into any accounting firm that will take me (CPA should help), but I am wondering if my name is going to hurt my chances in the career. Do you work with a ""diverse"" staff? I was born in the USA and this would be a shame if it were true in 2013. I don't speak with an accent, etc. very americanized.

Let me know your thoughts, and maybe some of you older professionals can fill me in if I'm just being slightly insecure, or if it would be worth my time doing such a thing.

BUT earlier today, I decided to look up some stuff on reddit and people have been saying ""Learn all those things on your own"" or ""Spending college on JUST that was a waste, I wish I learned it on the side"". So a while ago, I had this idea to just to spend my next 4 years on something FAR more productive (like computer engineering) and learning how to film on the side (even though it's my dream job/ career) and just look to gain experience by internships.

So I wanted to ask you guys/professionals what did you do to learn filming and whatnot."

It's not a secret to my friends and some classmates where I work, because occasionally I'll try to gauge their interest, help them out, etc. 

Apparently one of my classmates didn't enjoy the fact that he had no internship, I did, and I didn't do so well this semester. A logical person would: 

A. Ask Me about Internships/opportunities
B. Tell Their Mother and Try to Get Me Fired

Guess which Johnny Neutron did? He told his mommy. She e-mailed my boss, desperately lambasting me to get me fired. Didn't work. What does she do? No no she doesn't give up, SHE E-MAILS MY CEO, who I happen to be close with somewhat.

I know the economy has been better and whatnot, but you can get a job right out of college if you're driven.  

The ""experience paradox"" as I like to call it is a huge barrier for entry to recent grads.  You can't get a job without experience, but you can't get experience without a job, now can you?  This is the unfortunate state of many industries right now.

There is a solution, however.  **Internships.** Some paid, most not.  If you're a student, you should be interning over the summer before your senior year, and if you can find an internship during the semester, go for it as well.  Gaining this experience as a student not only allows you to learn far more at a younger age, but it also makes you much more hireable than your peers right after graduation.

Recent grads are usually not OK with this. There are bills to pay, family keeps asking you what you're doing now, etc.  The last thing you want to do is take a job where you may not get paid.  And let's be honest, the word *intern* has a sort of stigma about it.

This is where you have to weigh your options.  If you get an internship and really kick ass, it should only take a few months before you're hired on (maybe 2-3 depending on if there's an opening).  If nothing else, you now have the experience to apply for a job job, henceforth referred to as a jerb.  You can work part time or weekends at another job to help with the cash flow.  You're young.  Live off of ramen and PB&amp;J for a while, sleep on your moms couch or find a place via craigslist.

Paid internships!  They exist! They are usually more competitive, so get your resume/portfolio etc together!  I'm in advertising, so an application for an internship might require me to make a short video, write an obscure essay or complete some weird task and document it.  Put in the effort to make a great application, because the internship will be worth it.

The bottom line - This is your future.  You can make it what you want.  Put in the grunt work now while you're young and can afford to, and you will have a much better chance at landing your dream job.  Don't wind up miserable for the rest of your life.

If you have any questions I'll try to answer, but I'll warn you that I'm super busy right now, so it might take a while. You can also find a ton of answers to FAQs in the AMA I did with some other recruiters a while back:

This summer I may be doing a legal internship with the Municipality of Envigado, or large law firm. My spanish is mediocre and I could really use to work on it.

My dad was saying I should just say that my school schedule got busy so I can't work. He says I shouldn't tell them that I got a new internship.

I don't think saying that I did is bad though. The last 2 interns left by saying they got new jobs...
I just feel like saying school issues would be a lame excuse because the job is really flexible, so that shouldn't even be a real issue.

Should I just be honest and say I found a new and different opportunity. "

I guess it was because i never got an actual answer, so here i go again in the hopes that it works out.

Dear M,

The thing that bothers me the most is that even though i was your friend for 3 years, that we dated for almost 2, that i tried my hardest from the bottom of my heart to make you happy you just discarded me without a second thought. And you did it by sending me a long text, you never came and talked to me face to face, you didn't return my things, you never talked to me again. I am not sure i can come to terms with the fact that i loved you so much and you cared so little in the end. 

I always thought we were perfect for each other from the first day i saw you, we liked the same things, we were both family kids with the same upbringing and mentality, we wanted the same things for our future. Freshman year of college, but you were dating someone else and i didnt care, as long as i got to be your friend. You always used to joke that you would marry me someday, that i should wait for you. I never asked you to break up with her. And when she dumped you a year later i was there for you, but you moved on with someone else and i nearly lost it. But we stayed friends, i stayed by your side even though it hurt. And then we had our first class together and you asked me out, and i was beyond myself with happiness.
 I remember everywhere you took me, you used to show me off, how pretty i was, how in love we were. We could spend hours together just playing video games and watching netflix. I got into your games, your tv shows, i tried understanding all of the things you liked, i liked to spoil you because making you happy made me happy.
We were hopeless when we tried to study together for school, but i always made sure i made a study guide for you. You said there was no better way to study. Your mom used to say that was how she got your dad through college, that always made me so happy that she said we reminded them of themselves when they were in college. I miss them sometimes. We had our nerdyness together, we had a future planed. You even asked me to marry you before you left, when you left everything fell apart.  
You got that amazing job, but you had to leave for 5 months for training. I put on my big girl face and helped you through the application process, didn't cry when you left because you didn't want me to. I texted you every day and tried to act like you were still here. You were tired and being up there was stressful, i always tried to be supportive and cheer you on, not complain when you didn't call. And when you showed up after that first month at my door that weekend, i was sure i was imagining things. You had missed me, you hugged me and kissed me and i was so happy. You came down two times after that, i never felt that our relationship was failing. We called and texted all the time, you always said you loved me and missed me, you apologized for not calling me enough but that i still meant the world to you. 
And then one month before your graduation you came down without telling me, i saw a picture of you on facebook that said you were here. I called you the next day and you said you were here, you came over to see me before leaving again. I refused to argue and spoil what little time we had. We talked about your upcoming graduation, about me going up there with your parents, you said you loved me. 

And then two days later when i was still upset about you not telling me you had come down you answered with a long text saying that you were going through a time in your life you felt like you had to be alone, that your new job was going to be too much and i didnt deserve that. that i was amazing and i deserved someone better. I cried and begged, said i would carry the relationship on my shoulders if necessary, we only lived 5 minutes away from each other how hard could it be. But you said no to every single one of my pleas, that you had thought it over and you just wanted to be alone.

I had never felt so alone in my life. My world crashed, all of my summer plans gone. You texted me another 3 times saying the same things and saying you would give me my things back. You never did. You said we would talk in person when you came back down. We never did, not a phone call or email, nothing. I went to see a shrink for the rest of the summer. She helped me through it, to talk it out. Everyone expected me to move on easily, but you had been such a huge part of my life. I was so happy with you, i was madly in love with you i thought you were too; i mean that is what you acted like. I remember that day at the banquet hall when you saw me awkwardly dancing with your uncle, you took me aside and said i was perfect for you and that you loved me. But none of that mattered. School started again and i immersed myself in my new internship. I was so proud of that, i knew you were going to love that i got an internship with a big tech company; you said you were super proud of me when i had told you about it. 

3 months later i found out you had met someone new, that apparently she is perfect, you have plans to get married and buy a house. You told someone that i was just a nice girl to hang out with but not the type of girl you marry, because i didnt even make the bed after we had sex. I dont think anyone has said something like that about me, if anything i always pride myself on being the opposite. That hurt me more than you could ever imagine.

I never understood how you could discard me so easily, that i meant so little to you that in your head i didn't even deserve an explanation in person. It has been 7 months, and i am getting better.......but it still  haunts me. I need closure, i need you to give me truth. "

Dear Hiring Manager,

My name is XXXXXX and I am writing in regards to the International Student Advisor position. I am a recent graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University with experience working both abroad and domestically with international students .

My experiences working with international students are diverse: while working as an intern for Virginia Commonwealth University's American Studies program, I served as a cultural ambassador to Chinese students studying under J-1 visas. Additionally, while working as an office intern for the Richmond French Film Festival, I worked alongside French students studying under J-1 visas. Additionally, I have the competencies necessary to work in a complex work environment with multiple priorities. This can be demonstrated by my having simultaneously balanced an office internship, a part-time teaching assistantship, and full-time course load while maintaining dean's list status. Finally, I believe my current position, working as an ESL assistant in Bordeaux, France, speaks to my proficiency in verbal and written English as well as a strong ability to work in a cross-cultural environment 

I thank you for your consideration and look forward to the possibility of working for George Washington University.

Sincerely,

XXXXX



Anything is appreciated

16zq6n,13,2013-01-21,"Hey, meddit. I seem to be struggling a bit and have some questions for you guys.",Donacius,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16zq6n/hey_meddit_i_seem_to_be_struggling_a_bit_and_have/,"I entered medschool 6 years ago because I was interested in the human body. I didn't yet see myself as a future physician or someone who could help people. Now I do and it makes me extremely happy. The 2nd and the 3rd year when they were teaching us all the basics, like physiology, biochemistry and so on, were awesome. It gave me the feeling of stability and order in medicine. Now I'm in the middle of my 6th year with one of the top two exams coming up in a week and I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing or that I know something. How many tablets should I give the patient? 20 mg? 40 mg? Will that make a difference? What if something goes wrong? How do you know the correct amount of fluids to give, what test to order, etc?? Geez, I'm one of the top students in my year, I study hard, do my scientific work (which I love more and more), but I still feel like I have a very limited amount of knowledge. I like to think that I'm smart, smarter than most of my colleagues, but from time to time I get a slap on the face that makes me doubt myself. I don't mind, that keeps me in check. Am I aspiring for more than I should be? Yes, I'm *just* a sixth year student. Or am I *even* a sixth year student?

My internship sucked, really, I had more fun and gained more knowledge during one month of my study year compared to a half a year of internship. And now it's my last week and all I can see is random drug prescriptions, lack of organized and productive work, in order to help the patient, not just for the paper work as the main priority, lack of teaching process, doctors making fun of patients behind their backs and telling me that being a doctor ""is just an ordinary job now, nothing more"". Is it supposed to be like that? Is this normal in your place?

It's silly, but I sort of grew up studying together with medical dramas, where doctors look fancy, smart, are always sharp and their decision making is precise, fast and rational.  Then again, I watch something like Boston Med and it really does look awesome. I'm not from US, UK or some other big country with well established health care system, and what I see is far from that. I'm not unrealistic, I know that medical dramas do not portray the life as it should be, but they give me inspiration, they give me enthusiasm and willingness to push myself forward in order to be ""that good of a doctor"". And I believe that one can become like that, just not sure that is possible in the settings that I'm in. Makes me wonder - what is it like to study where you guys are? Is it what you've expected? Are you happy? How did you know that you were ready? How did you know that you've achieved everything you had to?

All this might seem more dramatic than it really is, but I'm still struggling. I guess what I want to ask you is if I will ever be a great doctor, even thought it's an incredibly stupid thing to ask.

Sorry for the errors and incoherent thoughts.

EDIT: just wanted to give an update to whomever stumbles here. I aced my exam, incredibly happy about that - it was partly because of you guys. You all made me feel much better and inspired again, thank you for that.

Hello all. I am CollegeIntern, (legal name), currently a Junior at DePaul majoring in Communications and Media. I would love to go into broadcasting, and am very interested in pursuing an internship in that field. 

A little background. 
I was cast in a play that was running out of state for an extended period of time this February. I took off the quarter to do so because there was no way I could miss as much class as I needed to. This past week I received word from one of the producers that the show has been rescheduled for summer 2013 and that we would no longer be going in February. Even though I'm happy to hear that the show is still going to be produced, the sudden change of plans left me in Chicago with no job, no classes to attend and incredibly frustrated. 

I know that this is a long shot because most companies have their winter and spring interns selected months before, but if there is anyone who could use one more intern, I'd be interested. I am available at any time, seeing as my only plans until March were just pushed back to August :(.

I have a strong theatre background and have no problem addressing large crowds or public speaking. Ideally I'd love to intern at a news station, but I also have experience in radio broadcasting both running the control board as well as time on the air. I'm not opposed to interning with a company that isn't a news or radio station - especially this late in January, but it is a huge interest of mine, and definitely a career path I'm interested in pursuing. 

If I sound like someone who would be of use to you or your company, I have a more extensive resume available for your viewing pleasure. 

It should also be noted that I realize there is a strong possibility of me not finding anything from this post. I am also interested in Summer 2013 internships as well. I planned on beginning my search for the summer month internships around this time anyway, so if someone thinks that they could use me down the line, I'd also love to hear from you. Lastly, if anyone even has some helpful advice about what to do in this last minute situation, I'd appreciate that as well. 

If you're still with me, thank you for reading all of that. I hope to hear from a few of you and really look forward speaking further. 

Take care, 
CollegeIntern"
16zny9,2,2013-01-21,20 M4F Twin Cities MN: Let's try again shall we?,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/16zny9/20_m4f_twin_cities_mn_lets_try_again_shall_we/,"Hello there how's it going? Just a brief intro on who I am and what I like. I'm 20 years old and am unique in almost every aspect. I am a part time sales associate at Ace hardware as well as a part time intern for a local cable channel doing high school sports events. I'm a current student at Hennepin Technical College in Eden Praire pursuing my diploma in Audio Production Specialist. I plan on continuing my education further at Anoka Ramsey Community College to over-ride my diploma into a 2 year Associates in Applied Sciences.

I can be a stubborn but yet, I am one of the nicest people that you can meet and get along with. I do have a ""hit or miss"" sense of humor, so if you don't catch on, I won't be hurt or offended. It somehow just comes on spontaneously (no there is on combustion involved with it, if there was then I'd be cooked). I'm quite difficult to upset or hurt since I care quite a bit, but when I am mad or somewhat displeased then I do tend to have a very cranky side to me. The upside of this is that I usually get over it fairly quickly (unless it was something quite dramatic).

Family is a top priority in my views and will not change no matter how much someone puts forth effort with, if this appears to be an issue I kindly ask for you to please move along. In addition I also believe my education is also one of the top priorities as I would like to finish what I've started and establish a full time job as some sort of audio engineer (maybe with my local cable company? I don't know, time will tell its tale). Music is practically the heart and soul of who I am. I am open to practically any genre since it's a part of my profession (anything extreme I'd have to ponder on). The 5 genres I'm a sucker for are Classic Rock, Alt. Rock, Techno, R&amp;B, and some Top 40.

I do know what I am looking for and it's basically this. I'm looking for someone who will actually take time and understand who I am, someone who can get along with my family, up for trying out different things (or just sit back and watch a movie, works for me), always happy most the time, and goes with the tide not knowing what to expect next in life.

If you think you're who I described above, please don't hesitate and message me and who knows? One thing could lead to another, you never know."
16zny0,2,2013-01-21,IWTL how to stop over analyzing. ,[deleted],IWantToLearn,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/16zny0/iwtl_how_to_stop_over_analyzing/,"I tend to over analyze, almost obsess and worry until I'm sick to my stomach about the most minute things.  For example, I have a lot of stress coming from work.  I'm in school (will graduate the end of this year) and have been at this job for two years.  I work with all women, and I get very concerned when my manager(s) get an attitude with me.  (Neither of them have any prior managerial experience. This is important to know because I think that's why they don't handle anything professionally; it's all based on emotion. If you did something wrong, they will either ignore you or give you attitude until they sit down with you.  If you do get a sit down, they don't ask your side of what happened; it's really just them reprimanding you for what they think happened, even if it's wrong. When you're on their good side, though, you're their best friend. It's not a healthy work environment for anyone.) I don't plan on being there past this semester; I am going to get a summer internship and continue there the fall semester part time or get a job on campus to hold me over until I graduate.  I try to just tell myself ""only a few more months"", but it's hard and causes me unnecessary stress.

Work is just one example.  If I'm sending out an email (ex. for a summer internship), I get really upset and can't stop worrying until I hear back. It's getting to the point where if I'm upset about something, it almost prevents me from doing anything else.  If I have a day off and I think something is wrong, I can't get myself off the couch.  It wasn't always like this. I just want to learn some tips on how I can stop sweating the small stuff!"

I dealt with it by studying hard to focus myself on something more positive than how miserable I was. For the most part it worked, and I even graduated valedictorian and got into a great school to study towards a great degree. I've managed to keep my GPA quite high, and I should be graduating this term if all goes as planned. I never complained growing up, with the idea that the end rewards would make the suffering worth it.

But, it seems like no matter what I do outside of the classroom, I never feel like my efforts are worth anything. I managed to get an internship at Intel, my dream company, only to come away with the knowledge that I suck at what I was hired to do and was labeled as incompetent to boot, despite the total lack of training both on the school's side and on the company's side. I was literally brought on, given a cursory explanation of the job, and told to sink or swim while my boss all but admitted that schools don't teach that discipline and they themselves don't train for it. On my way to the office every day, I secretly hoped someone would veer into my lane and hit me head on.

I joined a fraternity, and have made several efforts to improve our standing on campus only to have my ideas laughed away, ignored, or half-assed on the rare chance that someone else steps up to help me implement them. There's always an excuse when I need someone's help, but as soon as the rare moment comes that I'm unable to help one of these ungrateful bastards, *I'M* the asshole.

I'm just tired of feeling like my efforts make no impact around me. I'm tired of getting no recognition when I try to help my friends or the people I work and study with. I'm tired of busting my ass for my fraternity only to be labeled as one of the reasons for its problems while half our members are lazy and on the verge of failing out of school because they'd rather smoke weed and drink all day. (Nothing against smoking or drinking, but all things in moderation, you know?)

I don't even really know what the main thing I'm pissed about is. Most of my waking time is spent feeling as though I'm just spinning my wheels, and the remainder is spent wondering when I'm finally going to start enjoying my life. I've tried to make changes; I moved from my original university to a different one, partially because I was equally miserable back then. I got more involved in charity work, thinking I needed to focus on others rather than my own problems. Looks good on a resume but I can't get my head on straight enough to feel good about it.

Some days, I just wake up wishing I saw someone else in the mirror, and I don't know what to do anymore besides blankly stare ahead and ignore the irony that for all the good things that are supposedly going on in my life, I can't enjoy them.

So, sorry for the long, vague rant, for those who for whatever reason decided to read this. I feel like my username is a pretty good descriptor for my issues. I shouldn't feel this way, and yet here I am. Anyway, thanks for listening/reading."

I am currently in my second year of undergrad and am a premed at Washington University in St. Louis.  I was looking at my progress so far, and realized that I could qualify for MBA 3-2 program.  Additionally, owing to scholarships and a student job, obtaining the MBA would only cost a single additional year and a ~$25000 investment.  I was hoping that those with experience would be able to answer some of my questions and share any other additional advice you might have before I decide whether or not to commit.  I envision that a MBA would give me valuable leadership, analysis and communication skills that would allow me to become a leader within the medical establishment, and hopefully change the system for the better on a grand scale, but I have little knowledge of the MBA degree, and so I don't know if my suspicions are correct or not. 

-How much job or internship experience would you recommend before beginning the MBA segment?

-There are MD/MBA programs, would there be a significant difference in obtaining the MBA before med school and obtaining the MBA in conjunction with med school?

-What are the most important skills you have gained from your MBA program, and how could you see them being applicable in the medical environment?

-At what point is the investment in an MBA worthwhile, and when is the investment generally excessive?

-What career opportunities are opened by a combined MBA/MD that are not available to a MD alone?


In advance, thank you so much for sharing your time, knowledge and opinions."

I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Economics at a top engineering school. I love working with technology and coming up with innovative solutions to problems. I currently have an on-going internship (co-op) at an IT department in a large law firm.

After graduation, I have two routes I could go. A strict technical route and try to get a job in Software Engineering at a tech company, or try my hand at consulting. I have done a few case competitions and I am a member of my school's consulting club, so I do have some knowledge of consulting. I enjoy that it requires the same level of analytical thinking that I like in computer science work.

So my question to you is, what are my possibilities in the field of consulting? I have read a lot about management consulting vs. IT consulting and although I think recruiters would look to me for IT, I think I would enjoy management more. What can I do now that will better prepare me for a job in consulting? What kind of opportunities are there for growth? What about MBA school?I am a sophomore, and after my current co-op, I will have a chance to apply for a summer internship in 2014. What companies should I look into?

Thanks, I would love to hear your input!"

He said his buddy lives on a farm and told him about a medication called Ivermectin , which is an anti-parasitic. The owner noticed some fleas on the dog so he went to a feed store and bought *Duramectin* (Ivermectin formula for horses). It comes in a needle less syringe and he fed the whole thing to his dog. He brought the syringe in and it turns out he gave the dog a dose for a 1,000 lb horse. The nurse with the dog started crying, so we went over and found the dog had no pulse. The duramectin had been given the day before. We couldnt do anything... That was my first experience with a animal dying in my care.

Sorry if I'm speaking so broadly, but I see so much discrimination in society but most of it is towards white males. Here's an example, I'm trying to get an internship with a large financial firm, but only females from my school were invited to a networking dinner.


 I scored high enough on the LSAT to get into a great law school (Penn,  Virginia, Chicago), but if I was African American I would be able to attend top ranked schools like Harvard-Yale-Stanford with my identical stats.

I realize that affirmative action was needed at some point in our country when URMs were actively being discriminated against by institutions. However, it seems like AA has done a 180 degree turn where it is know discriminating against white males while protecting URMs.

My question is, why can't we simply live in a society where our worth is determined through hard work, intelligence, and practice-- not simply by the color of my skin or which chromosomes I randomly was assigned. I want to live in a world where I --and everyone else-- are judged based on the ""content of their character"" as MLK put it, not some arbitrary birth trait."

How do I stop the pattern, or at least understand the root of it?",kafkaticking,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/16yqci/i_22f_repeatedly_sabotage_my_relationships_and/,"There's a whole book here. I'm sorry in advance for the wall of text. Even if I don't get any response to this, I just needed to get this out on a page.
Hi. I'm a 22F who is experiencing heartbreak due to another self-sabotaged relationship. It was going so well - he [27M] treated me so well, we had a wonderful connection, and things could have been perfect if I hadn't ruined it... again.

I have casually dated many guys since I was 18, and I have always been the one dumping these boys for the same reason - I didn't want to be tied down; they wanted something more serious; I didn't feel 'ready' for a relationship. The idea of having a boyfriend made me feel uncomfortable and insecure. As though it would limit me in some way or bring me down. Usually a couple months later I was 'sorta' dating someone else again, and soon I was repeating my pattern.

The last two times I've done this, I've completely broken my own heart, twice, along with theirs. And I can't seem to learn from it, which makes me wonder if I'm insane. I'm going to see a counselor about this, but I could really use some objective (and harsh) advice from you as well, because you people seem to offer pragmatic, objective, and often insightful advice.
My pattern is rather uncanny because it has happened in the same timeline 3 times: meet the guy in the spring/summer, dump him in November, and by January desperately want him back again. And my heart is always broken by the end of all my crazy antics, and the guy I so desperately want to fix things with is just trying to get away from me.

I meet a guy who sparks interest in me, but at the beginning I'm generally indifferent and let him do the chasing. I usually express to him at the very beginning (and then keep telling him this as the relationship goes on) that I'm not looking for anything serious (the reasons have been: I'm graduating college and could be moving abroad; I plan to move abroad; or I'd like to focus on me).

Around month 5 or 6 into the relationship, things reach a high point. The guy is really into me, and willing to do anything for me. We've developed trust and attachment for each other. I'm quite happy, in spite of myself...
Then, I fall into my pattern: my doubts about myself, which I've kept at bay throughout the relationship, come spilling out due to a trigger. Sometimes the trigger is stress, or sometimes I feel completely annoyed by a minor thing the guy says. Sometimes it's an article I read, or something my brother says. Like ""That girl is too awesome to be caught up with a boyfriend."" In my mind: ""Am I not awesome? What am I doing wrong? What is wrong with me? THIS is why I've never reached my potential.. The only answer is to break up with so-and-so. Then maybe I can become awesome?""

I have never referred to any of these guys as ""boyfriend."" It makes me uncomfortable to have us ""In a relationship"" on facebook, so I never do it, often causing some insecurity in the guy. I usually never tell my family or friends that I have a boyfriend as it makes me feel... strange. Like I shouldn't be dating someone. Or that I have to hide it. For two reasons: 1) because I seem to be a serial 'casual dater' and this embarrasses me. Makes me feel fake, shallow, or flakey. and 2) because having a boyfriend is just distracting from focusing on me, and thus it is something 'bad'.
Family background: my mother has always been controlling, demanding, and overbearing. Throughout college, when I was home for the summers working, she would take my laptop and phone in order to force me to cut contact with the particular guy I was seeing. She would tell me I should focus on myself, that these guys were wrong for me (either they were ugly, or weird, or something else - there was always something bad about them), and scream at me if she found me talking to them. I eventually began to hate myself for dating a guy. Yet I kept doing it... and kept hating myself while I did it.

(Note: I'm not trying to blame my mom for my problems. I'm just throwing this in here so you can get a bigger picture of who I am. Ever since I was probably 10, I've always had this weird dichotomy of longing for companionship, yet having a natural fierce independence. So I've had many, many crushes growing up yet have never had a real serious relationship because I always break things off. And then start casually dating someone else. I had my first real ""love"" when I was 17. It was the same pattern - he was into me, I was disinterested, by November I'd detached myself. By late December/ January, I desperately wanted to be with him again. We got together but eventually he kept breaking up with me, on-and-off, and I was in love with him for 3+ years after that... Ever since, I've always been the one doing the breaking up.

When I was 18 and a freshman in college, I sorta had a brief, month-long romance with a long-haired, goofy-looking musician I'd met in my science lecture. I kept talking to him for the first few weeks of summer after I was back at home, working. My parents knew about him and tried to force me to stop skyping him or talking to him. This guy wasn't exactly the most handsome guy, but he was incredibly sweet and very talented, and we got along and liked each other. At one point my dad told me, ""You better not ever end up marrying an ugly fuck like [musician] and making fucking ugly babies."" I eventually detached myself from him and felt myself moving on.

From when I was 14, until I was about 20 or 21, my mother had access to and read through all my recorded internet conversations - gmail, gchat, facebook, everything - so she knew about who I was seeing and how I felt about them. She's seen most or all of my private conversations with friends and guys I've been seeing. I have only been able to begin disengaging myself from her emotional and psychological influence since I graduated college and have become financially independent.

My mother was also very demanding in other aspects of my life. I was never working enough or doing well enough. I had a total 17 different jobs throughout college but she was never satisfied. I worked in restaurants, freelanced, wrote for the school paper, had many internships, and usually worked 2 jobs at a time while being in school. Over the summers I typically worked 3 jobs (2 paying jobs + an unpaid internship). I worked many, many, many double shifts. It was never enough.

I could never be good enough, for myself or for my family. My brother is a highly successful computer programmer who shares my mother's mentality. Although I graduated from a well-known school with a high GPA, two majors, plenty of solid internships on my resume, good portfolios, and 2 full-time job offers, and am now financially independent, I still felt (and feel) far behind. That I never fully pursued my talents to their potential. That I could have done more with what I was given, had I not wasted my time on petty things like boys or Facebook, or sometimes giving into my depressive tendencies.

So these things come up and haunt me in any relationship I enter. During my senior year of college (last year), I entered a relationship again with the same symptoms (I had been single for about a year before this, and I had been very happy while single. I was scared and unwilling to give up that happiness of being single, yet I let myself date this guy with the same doubts and insecurities beginning to pop up more and more): I wasn't doing enough to focus on me. I didn't have time for a boyfriend, what was I doing. He was making me feel insecure and jealous, and I didn't like that. I wanted to be single for my senior year of college because I was in a transitional period and I saw no reason to be attached or in a relationship. We might move to different cities in 6 months and what would happen then? Why should we be so serious?

By November, finals were approaching and I just lost it and broke up with him. My stress level from taking 6 classes, working 2 jobs, and impending graduation took itself out in my usual pattern. I told him I didn't want a relationship. I was careless. He was heart-broken.

A month and a half later, I wanted him back. In January I asked him to meet with me and I explained to him: ""Hey D, I've thought about this and I realized being single doesn't make me any more happier than I was when I was with you. And you never distracted me from school like I automatically thought. My biggest distractions were my roommates and myself... I really like you and I'd like to enjoy the rest of our time in this city together, and we'll see what happens in May."" He agreed but unfortunately by then he'd mentally disconnected from me. How could he trust me again? How would he know if I'd just leave him again at the turn of a hat? Things were never the same. He ended up slowly detaching himself from me in the next 2 months. He cheated on me for a month, lied, and then we went through a messy break-up. I was rock-bottom, and blaming myself for it all...

Then bring in 27M. I met him during my time of heartbreak. I was graduating in a month then moving to Europe to work for the summer, with the possibility of staying there for the job. We had an instant connection, the first day we met. I told him I had just gotten out of a relationship; on top of that, I was just graduating; I had things to figure out; I was moving to Europe and possibly not coming back; I wasn't ready for a relationship... We just hung out and hooked up a few times. Then I left for the summer.

We kept in contact. He was naturally a very committed guy and he wanted something more, so he was waiting for me to return to the city. I was doing my own thing abroad, traveling alone, thinking of my career, and making new friends. But I still thought of him, never hooked up with another guy because I didn't want to jeopardize the potential I had with 27M, and knew I had to make a decision. Either I enter a period of independence after my heartbreak and focus on me; or I give it a shot with 27M because he was just such a gem. I chose to give it a shot with him. I told myself I wouldn't repeat my pattern of self-sabotage. That I would open up to him and trust him. That I wouldn't break things off when I felt that stress or my self-hatred/ self-doubt creep in again. That everything would be okay.

I returned to the States in the fall, to the city, and began working full-time. 5-6 months after meeting him, and things were flowing wonderfully. I was happy and so was he. He reduced my level of stress. We cooked together, treated one another with respect and care, and talked through any misunderstandings and conflicts. We were compatible.

When my fears that I wasn't doing well enough began sinking in again... I told myself that 27M didn't hold me back from pursuing my dreams. I shouldn't worry about that... When I spoke of pursuing an international career, he got excited and began thinking of ways to get a job overseas, too. He said he would travel with me and would support me in anything I did. He was ambitious, smart, and hard-working... albeit a homebody and a committed 'relationship guy.'

I was so stupid to throw it away.

But the fears and the doubts kept creeping back in. I began to feel like I was in a box: I didn't have as much freedom as I would if I were single... I couldn't just leave the city and travel the world without putting him into the equation. I was young, he would be 30 in 3 years. He wanted marriage and kids eventually (though not right now). I was finding it hard to see that in my future (it might change in 10 years).

On top of that: Why did I keep jumping from relationship to relationship? I hadn't been single in more than a year, and that was making me uncomfortable. Why did I have this pattern of dating so many guys? Was I really just insecure and unable to face myself, so I hid behind the comfort of a stable relationship and a stable guy like 27M? Was I just setting us both up for heartbreak? Didn't I really envy my friends who were 22 and 23, single and lighthearted, who weren't emotionally-exhausted or tied down like I was? Who were free to do what they pleased, without worrying about a boyfriend?

So then, one day (in November! surprise surprise), my stress got to a high point (I had been working 7 days a week for 2 months. A full-time job, and a weekend restaurant job). I said it: ""I see myself being single at some point in my 20's as I travel again... I'd like to focus on myself and figure things out.""

27M freaked out... he was of course hurt and upset. I e-mailed him a few days later hoping to clarify and reconcile things. ""I don't want to break up,"" I told him. ""I'm sorry for making a big deal out of that... I'm unhappy with myself and so I blame the relationship for it, but things are good between us and I'm happy with you... Let's try to keep it that way.""

A week later he broke up with me because he ""couldn't be in a relationship that he knows will end."" But we saw each other several more times in December, said ""I love you"" to each other, and cuddled in bed. I wanted to find a compromise. I wanted to find a way to have my independence within the context of a relationship, while learning how to make him feel more secure and not place an expiration date on the relationship. I wanted to tell him that he never limited me from pursuing my dreams, that it was an automatic pattern for me to say ""I want independence over a boyfriend,"" but I'd never truly thought it through. That I didn't want to repeat that pattern.

It was too late and by the time I'd finally had time to sort through what I wanted, he decided we should do No Contact. He never gave me a chance to talk to him.

There it was, I sabotaged things again... and I repeat my exhausting pattern yet again. I lost something wonderful. It's sinking in now... I have dreams about losing things I cherish, but the dreams are always about him. Why couldn't I make up my mind when I had the chance? Why was I always pouring my drink in the sink? Why did I throw away good things, sabotage my own happiness? Why couldn't I learn to take care of the things that deep down, I truly did cherish in spite of everything... I blew it, and broke both of our hearts.

Why do I do this and why do I never learn? What can I do to stop this? Please help.

TL;DR: I have a horrible and exhausting pattern of dating many guys, but always breaking things off because I want independence, or because I'm afraid of relationships, or because of my own self-doubt and self-hatred; then I want them back when it's too late. I've broken my own heart twice, and I can't seem to learn from my mistakes. Someone please illuminate my delusions..."

I look at it and know that I was right. 2 hours later I finished my test, turn it in, and leave thinking, ""Better luck next time."" That’s it; I thought I was done. 

Grades come out, and the teacher has given me an I (incomplete). After Christmas break I go to see her, and she accuses me of cheating. This was because on two out of the ten problems I have the correct answer, but almost no work. So, she shows me the test and asks me how I had come up with the answer. The thing is I didn’t think I did any of the problems correctly. I really thought I had gotten every one of those questions wrong. After nearly a month after taking the test there was no chance in hell that I would remember what I had done. 

All I knew was that I had no idea what I was doing while taking the test. I now that I struggled with those problems and I attempted them multiple times. The best I could come up with is that while taking the test, I may have thought I did those problems incorrectly (when they may have been correct) and attempted them again. In the process of doing this I would have cleared the part of my spreadsheet with the right answer. After a while on one problem I would have realized I was lost and either moved on or ran out of time on the test. 

The ironic part of this is that I didn’t do well on this test. I was given a low D. It’s not like it would have been hard to cheat.  The finals are not given back, but the students must turn in their excel sheets through email. I could have asked around and gotten someone’s answers to the previous years test. If I had done that I would have known the questions and answers ahead of time. I could have just pulled up my email and opened their excel sheet.

If I had cheated I would have a much better grade, would have been able to show all my work for it, and would not be in this mess. But I’m not that smart. I didn’t cheat, did horrible on the test, and now I’m being accused of academic dishonesty. 

I have to go to the honor court, and I have absolutely now way of convincing them I didn’t cheat. So what do I do? If I really am hopeless is it better to just plead guilty as charged? What does this mean for internships or looking for a job? How do you recover from something like this?

I am working on a startup called www.greekdrop.com , which connects our greek life demographic to various brands and companies through discounts, product samples, and potential internship and job offers. Think of it as a www.gilt.com for greek life members!

We are still in development as we do not have the online catalog up yet, but I have programmers building the catalog right now. **This is where I need your help.** *I am of the ""other gender"", so unfortunately I dont know of the hottest trends in women's fashion, etc.* I do have a couple focus groups organized which include my friends in sororities, but I thought I could get advice from here as well. 

I am currently talking to various companies, and it helps with negotiations if I can show them that I have a lot of students interested. **If I can get you girls to sign up with your full name, .edu e-mail, and house on the homepage, it would help bring us better brands.** (All your information is safe, we already have 300+ members signed up!) For example, Lulu lemon would not want to talk to us as a company, until we have thousands of girls signed up, expressing interest. You will gain access to the Beta launch which is essentially just the first week of discounts, and a lot other quirks. Also liking us on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram will definitely keep you updated as we get more brands, and that is also a plus with our negotiations too.

Twitter and Instagram: @greekdrop www.facebook.com/greekdrop


So far in our first week, we have talked to:

1. www.solebicycles.com , Retail: $380, Greekdrop: $299.
1. www.solewood.com, still in negotiations
1. www.hydracup.com, still in negotiations
1. www.12society.com is in once we have 5,000 users ""opted-in""
1. www.getsomejerky.com, buy a 10 pack, save 30% ($45.00 shipped for 30 oz. of BOMB jerky)

As you can tell, the brands we have signed so far are a little fraternity-centric, and I want to get more brands that appeal to sorority members! 


How are other ways you can use greekdrop? 

1. Get discounts on hotel rooms, 40% off if you book 20 rooms (perfect for formals) 
1. Find internship and job opportunities specialized for the greek life community, so you're competing with a smaller pool of applicants 
1. Redeem FREE product samples, for example get a box of 100 luna bars shipped to your house. 
1. Discounts on clothes, accessories, shoes.

Let me know if you have any questions, comments, feedback, or suggestions. I would love, and need suggestions on what brands to contact. If you have something you want to buy, suggest it to us, and we'll try to get that company to give us a discount! We are thinking of implementing a campus ambassador program If you want to get involved, send me a pm, and we can talk.

I was absolutely gutted, all the effort I put into this, all my time and commitment, all for nothing. I picked a different course. Still, something to do with medicine, right ? After few months of the course that I wasn't enjoying, I got dumped by a long-term boyfriend. I was really low, didn't know what to do next. 

I've decided to drop out and start from scratch. I've decided on a new course but abroad. Fast forward to 2013, I've graduated, I've done a year long industry internship and currently I am in grad school.

You beg me and tell me that you realized what you had given up and I was stupid and fell for it. Within 2 hours you were back to secretly texting him while I was in the bathroom. You were sending him messages saying how much you loved him and how incredibly happy he made you. You fucked me over again with no regard or remorse.

I don't get sick very often, but when I do it hits me like a ton of bricks. 

Two days ago I was [happy as a corgi on stilts](http://www.etsy.com/listing/93316391/reserved-for-wildhorse-inspirational?ref=af_circ_favitem), playing in the park with my SO. 

The next day I got up at 3:30am to be at work at 4am. I had a tickle in my throat, but I chalked it up to being dehydrated. As I rode my bike, I felt a chill in my chest and told myself not to get sick. I just can't get sick, I work 5 days a week to pay our bills and 2 days at an internship, needless to say, I don't have time for this shit. 

But, alas, as the day progressed it hit me. Before I knew it I had a fever of 102F. My whole body was achy and I had a migraine. I was coughing up a storm and I could not leave work early. 

FINALLY I was done with my shift, I today's shift covered and as I'm leaving, I realize my phone is missing. I go on a frantic search for about 20 minutes and being as I'm sick and feverish, I'm unable to deal with any of this like a normal person and I'm about to start screaming at everyone and blaming people for stealing my shit. Finally found it. I took a breath and apologized for my inability to deal with shit, at that time.

I got home and I laid in bed for about 6 hours unable to even cook for myself. I barely got up to go to the bathroom. Once my SO got here, he went to get me some meds and stuff for chicken soup. By the end of the night, I felt a lot better and even though I'm still at home sick, unable to do anything but rest and take care of myself, all I can think of is... **at least I don't have kids to take care of.**

TL;DR: I'm sick at home and my day was hell and I'm glad I don't have children who depend on me.

On another happy note, I finally have time to watch some [Classic Doctor Who](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/). Any other Whovians here?

This seems to be the only legit outlet for people in this city with stupid ""first world problems"".

I graduated at SCAD 2 years ago with a BFA in film and naturally, wanted to work in the industry. For about a year I worked furverously to get on waiting lists, make cold calls, and network to get on a set for any production...only to find a series of frustrating closed doors and cold shoulders. The reality is the tv/film industry is probably one of the most uninviting there are; and it's not like I didn't know that but with the surge of production in Atlanta, I figured I'd have a decent shot at any position. This wasn't the case. I will say that I was very lucky to land a decent editing gig with Georgia Tech (A great employer!) which I'm very grateful for,  but I still yearn to be back on a set. Anyways, I wanted to share some of my experience in hopes it at the very least it educates my fellow Atlanians about how the tv/film industry does business in our city. If you have any experiences at all, feel free to share.

When I graduated I put out my resume, like so many other Americans in this  day in age, to ~100 studios. I knew this was just a blank face attempt at getting any sort of reply, and as such had low expectations. I then was sought out by some of the people at the Georgia Film Board, they suggested I pay for a posting in their source book (a sort of listing of talent). I scrounged together what little money I had to pay for a tiny 40 word publishing in a book that I later learned, no one reads. After finding that out, and being out of my money I found out to get below the line (or crew) work you have to be an IATSE union member. Cool, I wanna join. I call the local office, they then told me there is a window every few months in the year I can get membership. Requirements are: about $1800, and (here's the kicker) 60 hours of professional crew work....just to apply.

So that was a dead end, it's the catch 22 of my (and so many others) industries. They want experienced people for entry level jobs, but you can't get the experience without the job. I was lucky and was able to meet some of the people working on the Walking Dead. I got to talking with them about how to get in the door. What I learned was, very few in fact were from Atlanta. Practically everyone were from other offices in LA/NYC. Even the interns were flown out here to work on set from LA. That's right, paid to fly out here to intern on a set. Out of all the crew I met, only one was a Georgia native. It dawned on me that the production companies were only producing here for the tax incentive (which I already knew), but *not* hiring much local talent. I was pretty shocked about this since most of these positions can be filled by almost anyone with some degree of carnal knowledge. Rather, people are being flown from places like LA/NYC to work and live here. One of the interns explained it really well, they basically follow each other in tiny groups working on set to set around the country. It's like a club that doesn't really let new members in or old members leave.

So I kinda just walked away from it. I've been working at Tech for a couple years (and loving it) and now I'm looking into grad school, but my fear is just to get out and find the same closed door mentality.

Has anyone here worked on crews or have any stories they could share? I'd love to hear from some other folks. Also, keep in mind, I'm not really bitching about it, I know it's crazy hard to keep work especially in TV/film. Just a little jaded, I guess."

It is an unpaid internship, but I'm mainly going for the experience. I feel as if this opportunity will allow me to get my foot in the door for the field of conflict resolution research / nonprofit organizations.

To tell you a little bit about myself, I'm a 23 year old male Korean-American, recently graduated with a B.A. in psychology with minors in political science and peace &amp; conflict studies. I'm a HIP (Help Increase the Peace by American Friends Service Committee[1] ) trainer and I hope to bring what I've learned through schooling and experience to this internship. I also have some ideas in education and dialog I hope to develop but I understand I have a lot to learn before I can actualize my ideas. In the future I hope to be in grad school and then eventually go for my doctorate but for now, working for nothing and learning whatever I can from wherever I can is my goal.

Anyway, I got an email from the communications and development coordinator asking me to begin looking for funding sources for my housing (I guess I'm being seriously considered). It would come out to about 3,000 USD for my 6 month stay. So today, I come to you reddit, to ask you for your advice. I've helped with project planning and fundraising for rotaract (rotary) in the past to expand a cramped school in Monrovia, Liberia but I've never had to look/ask for funding for myself from organizations. Any advice or leads on where to start or how to go about doing this would help immensely. Grants/funding opportunities directly related to the conflict field would be even better. This is new ground for me and could use a little hand holding.

I've posted this in a couple subreddits over the past few days but I haven't receive any ideas.

Story Time: I didn't get a public accounting internship in college.  This was a result of terrible grades early on (ended at 3.25 undergrad but was around 3.0 at the time I was applying), awful interviewing skills, and a general apathy about my future.  Had a few opportunities my master's year but nothing ended up panning out.  It sucked, and it felt awful since I understood that it was no one's fault but my own.

At any rate, I ended up getting a job as an accountant in a very niche industry at a small company.  Although, I do very little formal accounting.  I've now been there for 20 months or so.  More to the point, I finally got it together and have passed my first part of the CPA exam and if all goes well, I'll be done this summer.


As you may have guessed by now, I'm looking to explore the opportunity of moving to public accounting once I pass all 4 parts.  Is this something that regularly happens?  Does anyone have an experience similar to this they would be willing to share? Even just general advice on how to move forward would be amazing.

Thanks for any/all advice.  Sorry, this turned out to be much longer that I originally thought.


TL;DR - Stupid/lazy dude didn't get public accounting job out of college, now thinks/hopes he's less stupid and wants to get another crack at it after he passes CPA exam.

(Started as an intern Aug '12, Account Coordinator Oct '12, Accounts Assistant Dec'12 - Present, all within the same company). I have a degree in Accounting and Finance.

I am 22 yrs old and I am a Korean born British Citizen.


Taking all this into account, how easy would it be for me to move there find a job/get a visa?

My Aunt and Uncle are currently living there and so at the very least accommodation in the short term can be covered.

I've heard it is a great place for young professionals to springboard their career and as it stands right now, I am sick of living in London and would love to get to an East Asia country. (I've considered Korea but I would have to do my national service first, which is not something I'm interested in). I have also heard it is very easy for foreigners to get jobs in Singapore, how true is this? 

A lot of the Singaporeans I've met here in london have been super nice, are you all like that or can I expect some hostility as a foreigner? 

So far I've been sending out a few applications via jobsdb.com, is this the best site to find jobs in Singapore? Would it be reasonable to just go there without a job offer and expect to find something within a couple of weeks/months?


Edit: Jesus Christ guys, I don't know how to get it through to you. I have lived in the UK my whole life. I have never lived in Korea. I am a British citizen. I DO NOT HAVE TO DO THE NATIONAL SERVICE. If your advice is ""go do your service"" then please just pass over.

(Israel),UpBoatDownBoy,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/172ygl/need_help_with_funding_ideas_for_housing_during/,"Hey Reddit, I currently live in PA, USA and I recently applied for an internship at the School for Peace, Neve Shalom/ Wahat al Salam in Israel. Neve Shalom/ Wahat al Salam is a cooperative community jointly founded by Israeli Jews and Israeli Palestinian Arabs to show that they can live peacefully together.
It is an unpaid internship, but I'm mainly going for the experience. I feel as if this opportunity will allow me to get my foot in the door for the field of conflict resolution research / nonprofit organizations.

To tell you a little bit about myself, I'm a 23 year old male Korean-American, recently graduated with a B.A. in psychology with minors in political science and peace &amp; conflict studies. I'm a HIP (Help Increase the Peace by American Friends Service Committee[1] ) trainer and I hope to bring what I've learned through schooling and experience to this internship. I also have some ideas in education and dialog I hope to develop but I understand I have a lot to learn before I can actualize my ideas. In the future I hope to be in grad school and then eventually go for my doctorate but for now, working for nothing and learning whatever I can from wherever I can is my goal.

Anyway, I got an email from the communications and development coordinator asking me to begin looking for funding sources for my housing (I guess I'm being seriously considered). It would come out to about 3,000 USD for my 6 month stay. So today, I come to you reddit, to ask you for your advice. I've helped with project planning and fundraising for rotaract (rotary) in the past to expand a cramped school in Monrovia, Liberia but I've never had to look/ask for funding for myself from organizations. Any advice or leads on where to start or how to go about doing this would help immensely. Grants/funding opportunities directly related to the conflict field would be even better.  This is new ground for me and could use a little hand holding.

**TL;DR: Need advice and help finding sources for funding in order to be housed in Israel for my (potential) unpaid internship.**

I have excellent professional references such as a project manager at a major company that works with missiles and satellite tech, the other is a CEO at a major bank in Texas, and the last is a Branch Manager at the main branches lobby. I've worked on several class projects that pertained to real companies as they agreed to allow students to work for them as free consultants as long as we were guided by professors so that our work would be credible and useful to them.

I wanted to ask a favor of all of you and I will try to keep it as short as possible. My friends and I need help doing something very special for a friend who is dying of terminal cancer.
 
Basically, I’m trying to send my close college friend to the Super Bowl. My friend is a diehard 49er fan, and this could be the last game he will ever watch them play in. About seven months ago, a checkup for what seemed like a sinus infection and some associated vision problems turned into a fight against a cancerous golf ball-sized tumor in Nishant’s face; doctors gave him a 50/50 shot at the time. Six months later, after grueling chemo and radiology, it looked like he would emerge victorious in his battle. The cancer in his sinus looked to be all but gone. Unfortunately though, a post-treatment biopsy revealed cancerous growths in several spots throughout Nish’s bone marrow – a condition known as esthesioneuroblastoma, which has been documented in less than 1000 cases since its official discovery in 1924 - and the condition is pretty much fatal. Nish has been given 6-18 months to live.
 
At this point, I am coming to this site for multiple reasons: 
1. I am raising money to fund this trip for him and his brother (his brother quit an awesome internship in silicon valley and withdrew from school to come home and take care of our friend). All donations can be made through the link at the bottom. Any donation, no matter how small would be amazingly appreciated.
 2. We are looking for ways to get tickets as cheap as possible for the game. We have been in contact with multiple team front offices and NFL players, but nothing has come through thus far. We aren't looking for a handout, but buying tickets at face value (950) for him would be an amazing help to our cause. Every NFL player gets 2 tickets at face value if they want them so we are hoping that we can buy them through a player and that this would be a nice PR opportunity for that player. If anyone knows anyone in any type of front office role that would be helpful as well.
 3. I am looking for advice from people on how to publicize this to get the ball rolling. We've been planning this for a week or two but it's pretty hard to get the ball rolling without knowing if his team was going to be playing.

I don't want to get ahead of myself here, but I have an interview with Accenture in about a week or so and I'm wondering if anyone here could tell me what working for the company is like?

I've read some small reviews on glassdoor.com and indeed.com but I want to know, specifically from someone in a software engineering role what day to day life is like with them.

At the moment I have a somewhat cushy job within the local government. Though I have a B.S degree in CS as of December, I'm still being paid an ""intern"" wage as there are currently no higher up roles.

I make about $35K a year and they are also willing to pay for me to get a masters degree (I've already been accepted, though I'm not sure if it's for me).

So, to cut to the chase, my questions are, if I were to pass the interview...

* From a salary point of view, would accepting the job be worth it?

* What is the work/life balance like at Accenture? I know a lot of people say the work overtime.

* What is this ""bench"" I hear about for consulting companies, do you get paid while on it, is there a danger in being there? 

* Is the job secure? (My current one does not pay much but I don't see them getting rid of me anytime soon).

* Any other advice/insights about the company are welcome.

Thanks."

(Art majors!),fucking_vertices,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/171qsd/college_or_job_art_majors/,"In a bit of a bind here -- I'm working at an unpaid internship right now doing 40+ hours a week (nothing better to do, but it's also expected for me to do a lot of hours to get a full-time position later on, showing I'm working hard, committed, etc.)

Anyways, they say that they're considering me for a full-time position, but I still have about 65 units to go on my major (it's a Design major, if that helps, I do 3DS Max modeling). If I was offered the full time position I would have to move 3 hours away from my college to their new premises, and it would be offered before I can complete my major.

I really like my job, but I also want to finish my degree. Getting a job there after my degree probably won't happen, as it'll be a year later. :( I'm not sure what I should do -- do I stop with my major and pursue more job experience, or pass on the full-time and finish my major? I'm not sure how much an art degree matters in the long run.. 

The main thing holding me back from not accepting it immediately is that a) my college is funded by my grandpa (his health is degrading :( has alzheimer's) and I would feel pretty bad for dropping out and b) i'm worried not completing it now will completely fuck me over long-term when looking for a future job if this one falls through in the future.

I've been considering a few options, such as putting college on hold for a year or two and then slowly completing the rest of my degree at a local college around the new area, but i'm not sure how this will affect my future job hunting -- i'm at a UC right now (pretty good school in cali), and would be completing my degree probably at a less awesome school. Then again, art major -- shouldn't the portfolio do most of the speaking in an interview?

The job market right now is full of horror stories of new graduates not being able to find jobs, let alone jobs they genuinely enjoy! If I decline the full time position am I royally fucking myself?

**TL;DR Design major, have opportunity to get full-time, paid position at company I love working at, would have to drop out of college and complete later or not at all**

What should I do, Reddit? Any tips from art majors working for companies would be appreciated! u_u"

As an intern trying to secure a full-time position, this is normal/expected behavior. Instead of thanking me for my work, he yelled at me and declared that I had a ""negative attitude"" for reminding him of my achievements, and said, ""We are PAYING you - don't act like you're doing me a favor.""
* Takes frequent ""business trips"" to South America, Miami, Texas, and Colorado ski resorts (even though it's a 6-person startup located in the midwest).
* After I quit, he told me (in writing) that he was impressed and proud of my work, and begged for me to stay (even inappropriately asked how much my new job was paying, so he could match it). He promised to write me a letter of recommendation, and pay me for my last 3 days. Never did it.
* It's now 2 months after I left. I politely emailed him about the whopping $230 he owes me, and he responded by telling me that if I completed a few more tasks for him, he'd pay up. When I told him that he's legally obligated to pay me for my last 3 days of work, and that I won't complete his tasks because I'm no longer an employee, he ended up calling me ""unprofessional"" and ""disgusting"" and promised to defame my name to all current/future employers. Thank goodness it's in writing, and thank goodness my new employer thinks he's absolutely nuts."

I disappoint myself every day by choosing to continue to do nothing with my life instead of taking advantage of the opportunities that practically throw themselves at me.

I spend every day debating in my head whether the good outweighs the bad in my life, and whether it's worth putting up with the bad any longer. ""The elevator's taking too long to get here? I should probably just off myself now and be done with it."" I need these thoughts to end, but mom and dad are convinced I just need a better outlook. *Fuck* them. When all I need from them is unconditional love, they respond with passive aggression and condescension.  They threatened to pull me out of school when I nearly failed all of my classes, and constantly tell me I don't need medication, that I'm just fine. But I'm fucking *not*.  I'm definitely depressed, and almost definitely have ADHD.

I'm a student at an elite institution, and my parents berate me for not using my position to open doors to internships, study abroad programs, etc. They don't understand that the only person that's more disappointed than them is me. I hate myself for taking up space in my family, at school, at my job. Anyone else would be motivated by their good fortune to succeed, but my relatives, classmates, and coworkers are stuck with me.

I should talk to a professional, but stepping out the window 10 feet away from me seems so much simpler.  I hate that I'm this selfish, but I don't give a shit about what my death would do to the people around me.  They're not the ones who are dealing with this.  If they knew, they'd kill me themselves."

My question basically is, is there another way?  A masters degree would be at least a full year commitment, and about $50,000 of debt, but I think would certainly increase my chances at least marginally.  But...is there any other way?

Big rant ahead, so read at your own peril. :)",HunterFett117,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/171bd8/as_a_health_care_employee_who_just_lost_a_dear/,"This is my second post, and not for Karma. This is because I need to speak my mind, and this is the internet, the last remnant of Free Speech.

I am a Clerk at my local New York City hospital. I do not have a degree in medicine, nursing, nor any degree at all save my High School Diploma. I am, however, well versed in a number of subjects and have always been told I'm a bright guy. My current position requires me to transcribe doctor's orders in to a computer system, and relay relevant information to relevant parties at the request of trained medical professionals. Bluntly, I'm the hired peon without whom the system would cease to function. At least, as things stand now.

You see, the state of health care in this country (all politics aside) is atrocious. As I said, I work in New York City - Staten Island, to be precise. The borough nobody remembers. But we're still part of New York City, and as I happen to live right next to the free boat to Manhattan, you can imagine the hospital in my neighborhood gets its fair share of madness. And let me assure you your imagination likely pales to the reality of what walks through the door at any given moment. The real world is a scary place, my friends.

One of the biggest issues most of my peers face right now - those with degrees - is finding a job. Any job, degree maybe not even a factor anymore. Just a goddamned job. In this sense, I'm lucky. No experience in the medical field and bam, here I am in charge of legally protected documents that have information critical to patient care. No degree, no experience, just luck of the draw in having awesome neighbors. 

Six years, I've held my position. In this time, I've learned a lot. I've been mistaken for a doctor by patients, visitors, and even new staff. In six years the most important lesson I've learned is: Never get sick in July. Anybody who has worked in a hospital knows exactly what this means.

In July, Med School has graduated. They've had their summer break, and now it's time to be a Doctor. That's right, you finished school, now go save people. The majority of your experience up to this point has been a classroom setting, and now you're being thrown to the wolves, ready or not. 

New York City has a rather infamous ""No Child Left Behind"" program in the public school system - of which system I am a product - that I feel in some ways extends to Interns. That is a cruel overstatement to many of the fine individuals I work with on a daily basis, but some of these people should NOT be physicians. On top of those select individuals who have their own various personal issues to work through before they can get down to saving other people, the system in which the people who are truly meant to do good deeds in this world hinders them to the point of frustration. 

Medicine is a business in this country. I don't think this is breaking news to anybody with half a brain. But there's something inherently wrong with that, don't you see? If you for one second gave a shit about your job and realized that somebody's life MIGHT JUST depend on it, might you not take a little more care in what you're doing? Don't you think that saving a life would take priority over making money? The money is the reward for a job well done, for having saved many lives and made people healthier and happier for it. Instead all anybody sees is a dollar sign. The Almighty Dollar determines who gets care and who doesn't. Who gets the surgery and who just can't afford it. 

""Medicine isn't free! Doesn't come cheap!"" Then how the hell is the flu shot free to anybody who walks through the door? They pay me and offer the shot, free of charge. Hell, I get a full physical at work for free the month of my birthday. Don't even have to go out of my way to get results back. The benefits of being an employee? But what makes me special?

The fact that I see the emergency room send up people who barely have a heartbeat, pulse, no respiration, and they think this person is okay to GET IN AN ELEVATOR?! Why aren't you treating this like an EMERGENCY?! But I'm not trained. No school here. No degree. I'm the lowest man on the totem pole. The only people I can boss around if I REALLY want to be an asshole are the housekeepers. But I'm not an asshole, and most of them are nice people who just needed a job like many other people out there.

The problem is, though, that such things are so common in my hospital - the only one on the northern side of Staten Island, mind you, servicing a full one-third of its population just by default, and that's when the other two don't decide to just not take any more admissions 'cause they're too full. 

I've seen quite a bit of the things one can see in a hospital. Crazy naked people, various bedside procedures, I have regular views of pictures taken during a surgical procedure, and often amuse myself with guessing what organ that is without peeking at the diagnosis. I'm pretty decent, but don't care to study up on it. Not when this is the sort of care that people are being given.

This all stems from the fact that my neighbor - a wonderful man who he and his wife treat/ed my siblings and I like their own grandchildren, just passed at my place of employment this evening. And I can't help but wonder immediately, ""Who was working tonight? Who was on rotation? How hard did they REALLY try for him?"" Not that anything could be done about it at this point, or that I would say anything to any of them; my opinions on most all of them are well-formed by now.  But I still can't help but wonder, did they REALLY do everything that is realistically in their capacity, or was the lazy one working tonight? Was the ditz in charge? The snob? Who?

And why should I have to wonder these things? Why should these thoughts even occur? It's simple. Medicine should not be a business. The lives of people you care about, of people you love and who love you back should not come down to a dollar sign. Because when you're the one on the short end of that stick, ""Too bad, you just couldn't afford it,"" doesn't seem to answer things quite as easily.

My neighbors, mind you, could afford it. The problem was he was too sick to travel to the city. These things happen. And so he's relegated to the commoner's hospital. The place where the drug-seekers and homeless end up. A place that patients have ended up calling home for months, if not years on end, the latter of whom call it their final home. I see these things and I have no choice but to just shut up and do my job. 

When I say I have no choice, mind you, I say that as a human being. To illustrate, I was having a terrible day at work. nearly ten discharges, and just as many admissions, back to back to back to back, and all the paperwork goes through me. We're also short-staffed, so I'm covering two desks by myself. This is a regular thing, by the way. So I'm going about my business when a patient walks up tot he desk. Average middle-aged white guy. His speech is a little slow, but that could be from anything, so I think nothing of it. He proceeds to tell me he's from this room, and this is his name. I nod politely, just wanting to get back to the massive pile of work in front of me, and ask him what I can help him with. He then tells me he was in THAT room before, and he almost died. I begin to go back to my work, trying to be polite, but he repeats himself, and then asks if I was working that night. I pause and suddenly, I do remember calling the code - overhead announcement for everybody to get your shit together and get to this floor because it's go time. I tell him as much - minus expletives - and he offers his hand, stares me dead in the eye and says, ""Thank you. You saved my life that night. Thank you."" 

That is all it takes. From that day on, I have given everything I can to my job every time I go there. In my limited capacity, I do my best to make a difference every day in a place that most of the staff consider a hell-hole. Patients know it. Those affiliated with anybody in medicine on Staten Island know it. You don't go to one of the local hospitals unless you know somebody very well, or your doctor is in constant contact with you while you're admitted. Otherwise, it's a total crap-chute. 

I see it on a daily basis. I speak the language. My friends ask me for diagnoses on things when I have no place diagnosing anything. But there's nowhere else to go, and most people on Staten Island don't have the money to afford top-of-the-line health care anyway. But what makes average middle-aged white guy any less a person than me? What makes fat obnoxious drug-addict woman any less a person? Her actions, maybe, but who is anybody to judge any of that? 

Certainly not a Physician who has taken an oath to ""above all do no harm."" If leaving that person to rot in their own excrement and ultimately die isn't doing harm, then we badly need to redefine ""harm.""

But all of this is somehow okay because of the cost. The fact that my neighbor, a wonderful, pillar-of-the-community kind of guy is given the same quality of care as everybody else when if he'd simply lived in Long Island in a wealthy community, he'd have had some of the best doctors in the state taking care of him just by virtue of the fact that he had a little more money. Why isn't everybody treated like a human being, given everything you have and more? Does that sound exhausting to you? Then you don't belong in medicine. 

If you're in med school right now, and are doing it because it's the family legacy, or because it was your parents' dream to have a doctor child, or just some fantasy of wealth and notoriety, do us all a favor and don't bother. We have enough people who don't pull their weight, don't contribute to the TEAM of people it takes to make somebody well. And if you can't comprehend team, then I'm afraid I can't help you. Go play some sports, or some Halo or something. Just don't take charge of other people's well being. 

Life isn't a business."

The damage is not so bad. The lens popped out, but I was able to pop it back in. However, the frames have been slightly bent out of shape. The sunglasses are Von Zippers and came with a warranty, though this would not usually cover damage that is my own fault.

What do you think I should do?

edit: Very harsh so far. I know this was negligent and stupid of me to do. I realize my mistake and I feel like absolute shit. Was just curious whether anyone knew any warranty loopholes. Von Zipper is a multi-million dollar corporation, I am a mere intern with not much money.

Of course, those grades didn't depress me. If anything, my depression and apathy caused the grades.

In September I discovered partying and for the first time in my entire life I had a social life instead of just being locked in my room on my computer. I became a bit of an alcoholic for a bit even. Those nights were incredibly manic. 

Another thing that makes me unbelievably happy is my boyfriend. We're long distance and I won't see him until the summer and then only for a couple days, but just thinking about him makes me feel like life is worth while.

So basically, I graduated in May of 2012 from a school in NYC and I obtained a BBA in Marketing. I applied to many positions before graduation and I even went on several interviews but nothing exactly panned out the way I hoped. I have a decent background in social media and I've done work at an in-house ad agency at my school where I worked with real clients. I want to get into Account Management and perhaps transition myself into Account Strategy one day. I'd also consider a social media gig.    


So for the past 8 months since graduation, I've only been able to do occasional freelance work at my friend's company while I look for something more permanent. I honestly didn't think the economy would be this bad right now. Of all my friends who I graduated with who are in advertising, about 40-50% (perhaps an overestimate) of them are employed at an ad agency.    


Since the job market has been so bleak as of late, I've thought about switching into different fields but I do still want to try my luck in advertising. I'm also open to doing client side work. I've been looking at both agency and client side but when it comes to entry-level positions, there's aren't too many out there and if there are, there's usually some sort of requirement that knocks me out of the running (usually looking for 1+ year of experience, etc). Apparently, there's been a hiring freeze at a lot of ad agencies.    


I've been on a bunch of interviews since graduation and here's the breakdown of my results:  
* 1 client side interview in which I didn't receive an offer  
* general interviews at 2 pretty big ad agencies  
* an interview at a mid-sized independent agency for an AAE position that's still in the air after 2 months  
* an offer for an SEM internship which I turned down  
* another offer for an unpaid social media internship which I also turned down  
In retrospect, I should have taken either one of the internships but (1) I thought I would have filled the AAE position at the mid-sized agency already and (2) I didn't want to do SEM because it would have bored the hell out of me to stare at Excel all day. Regardless, I can't change the past and I have to look onward.    

I'm still looking for jobs everyday. I signed up for indeed.com and I get like 20 emails every morning from various keywords that I set. I've tried to add as many HR managers from various NYC ad agencies on LinkedIn and sent them messages expressing my interest in the agency and requesting a general meeting with someone in HR, which resulted in 1 of the above general interviews and a few other regular chats through email.    


What I'm trying to get to is that I'd love r/advertising's advice on what I should do. Any tips on skills to learn? What should I do during the time I'm unemployed? I'd love to hear any and all advice from all you guys, especially anyone located in NYC. Whether it be on this thread, through direct message, or even in person, I'd love to chat with you. I can send you my resume and cover letter to see if I'm doing anything wrong. I just want to absorb as much knowledge as possible. And with that said, I wouldn't mind picking up a mentor or two in the process.    


**TL;DR:  
* I graduated not too long ago and I still haven't been able to find a job in advertising/marketing.  
* The job market isn't that great right now and I need advice on how to break into account management or an ad agency in general.  
* I'd love to learn more and perhaps pick up a mentor or two.**

I'm a student at the moment who has had to take out a year due to depression and anxiety already and I'm struggling so much to finish my degree and it breaks my heart. My degree is the most important thing in my life. Now the background to this, I will have to go back quite a bit. When my mother was a teenager her parents were alcoholics and when her dad got drunk he got violent and started raping my mum and her sister. My mum had to have an abortion as a consequence at the age of 14. Now this has obviously greatly impacted on her and her mental health. I remember that when I was a teenager she would suddenly get mad and start hating her own children, start locking me into rooms and beating me up and chasing me if I tried to escape. One of the worst times was when I was taking a bath, I felt so utterly vulnerable, since I was naked and had to be careful not to slip. My father knew about all this but he never did anything. I didn't grow up in the UK and my biggest dream was always to live and study in London and luckily I managed to get a place at a university and my dream seemed to have come true two years ago, when I did one of my favourite modules, had a total crush on my lecturer and he was at least also flattered. He took great care that I got to do something exceptional for an assignment. I put every effort in and hardly slept for those twelve weeks, was counting the hours till I got to see him again etc. The typical stuff you do when you're head over heels in love. And I genuinely believed he cared about me, at least about my grade and career. For another assignment I asked to speak to him for advise and went to his office. There was a note saying he'd be back in a couple of hours. Being the love-struck thing that I was I waited and waited and he never turned up. That little thing broke my heart. Before that day, I would never have cried in public. But back then I wasn't able to control myself and cried, or rather wailed on public transport. My lecturer apologised the same day via email, but that didn't help me at the time. Then summer came and I went back home to my dad. I wanted to show him everything I did that semester, it was the first time I was truly proud of myself. But he literally didn't care, he gave it a half-arsed attempt to look like he cared, but his mind was elsewhere. After a while I told him how much that hurt me, that he doesn't care about my life, he gives me money and when there's something that needs to be sorted he will help, but if I'm successful, happy or sad, he won't care. We had the biggest fight we have ever had and didn't speak for four months. I had to move back in with my mother, who is not violent anymore, but I'm still walking on egg-shells and need to be super careful that I don't do something to make her start hating me again. I was scared for my life sleeping at hers and heart-broken and deeply hurt by my father. During that time I did an internship and was desperate to be able to tell someone about my successes and failures at work. The only person who would listen was my ex-boyfriend, who has mental issues of his own, battles with addiction and raped me a couple of times during our relationship. When I finally came back to London it was only to move out of the flat share, a place that reminded me of happy, successful times, that was at least sort of my home. But I was unable to find a new affordable place, I was unable to find a job and on top of all people were starting to attack and destroy the only place that I ever called a home, the only place that I felt safe (London riots). We were quite close to the rioters and prepared to be able to leave in a matter of seconds. Then my sister got very sick and I had to return to my parents as I wasn't able to do anything anymore on my own and would just be crying all day long. That's about one and a half years ago and I still can't study. I have no energy and I'm trying so hard, but every day is a big struggle to just live, eat, shower etc. I don't want this anymore, I just want to be happy and be me again. I hope this isn't too long and I don't know why I'm posting this here, it just needs to get out of my mind and be heard."

A few months ago I reached out to you guys for some sound advice and I am grateful for what you shared with me. I still don't have much of a portfolio per say, but I have been doing various tutorials and things and customizing them to make them my own. For a web designer with no experience, is this acceptable to do? I've been trying constantly to find an internship or a mentor so I can gain experience and pay my dues. I've gotten emails back from various places and when they ask for a portfolio, I show them a few examples, even though I don't have my own site yet. I never receive a reply or hear back from them, ever. I would say it's my lack of solid fancy looking sites. I'm also going to have to teach myself cms and php because everyone here seems to mostly want content management systems and php.        

Other things I've done is try to create a good online presence (got 85 twitter followers so far) and have bought a domain name. I will be building a site for myself, but I'm just planning the design of the site at this stage. I've begun to network with other web designers and developers online through social media. I've been reading everything I can get my hands on on business/entrepreneur and web design/development and trends. I haven't made business cards yet because I'm waiting until I finish my site first.  I'm trying to create my own content for my portfolio but it does seem like a juggle with trying to maintain my grades in school and do projects and homework. The rest of my course is mostly coding and object oriented programming, so not much visual examples to add to my portfolio.

At this point, I'm having a hard time even lining up a retail job, but that's maybe due to the one year gap in my resume between loosing my last job and starting school. Not being able to find any job right now is even more of a scare when thinking about just jumping out there and freelancing. It seems like it's hard to find anything now.             

I'd love to hear more about building up a portfolio with no experience. HTML5/CSS along with photoshop (psd2HTML) seem to be my strong points. I'm struggling with javascript and java and MSSQL, even though if it's a premade javascript/jquery plugin, I could implement it no problems, just not able to code from scratch. Also if any of you are from Toronto and would like to be a mentor, I'd love to volunteer my time.



Thanks"

What I learned: This is a lie.

Situation now: Living alone without worrying about scheming, asshole roommates.

How to be a godawful roommate. (True stories. Disclaimer: probably lots of grammatical errors but in a fit of anger, don't care)

1. Bring your 37 year old boyfriend with little notice when you told me that it would just be you and myself.

2. Bring your 37 year old boyfriend who just got his antidepressants.

3. Bring your 37 year old boyfriend who, on the day we had to unpack and move everything in the apartment, decided to go drinking and chat up the bartender instead.

4. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who decides to throw a fit at me for using the vacuum to clean the apartment when your girlfriend already ok'ed me using said vacuum.

5. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who decided to get trashed and came out to the living room in skimpy underwear when I had guests over. 

6. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who made my guests uncomfortable while wearing skimpy underwear in the living room.

7. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who has the balls to tell me that I live off other people when you're the one who lives off unemployment checks from California. You do remember you told me that you had the checks shipped to a PO box which was then shipped to NYC, remember? How was I the one who lived off others when I had a full-time internship which led to a full-time job?

8. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who got mad at me for touching your girlfriend's boobs (I'm a gay man and you know this). Storm into your room, tell me to ""FUCK OFF"" and then give me the silent treatment for 2 months after I apologized for hurting your feelings.

9. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who decides to get drunk then storm into my room while I'm not there, take your shoes off, then drinks a full can of beer on my bed and leave it there when you're done.

10. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who yells at me for asking your girlfriend to not let you go into my room anymore.

11. Be the girlfriend who gets mad at me for asking you to tell your boyfriend ONE thing after complaining to me all year about your boyfriend. Oh, that's right. You don't want to get involved, you dumb bitch.

12. Be the girlfriend and 37 year old boyfriend who tells me that management companies can only ship deposit checks to ONE address and they would rather have their address on it because ""Not that we don't trust you or anything, we'd just rather have it sent to us."" Aren't you the one who defaulted on all your credit cards and you're still living off your unemployment?
NOTE: I called the management company, they ship to multiple addresses. The look on your face when I told you this was PRICELESS.

13. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who loses their wallet and asks me to lend them money after ALL THIS SHIT HAPPENS.

14. Be my former coworker who asked me to move in with them because ""you trusted me.""

15. Be my former coworker roommate who asks me to buy a $1,000 couch after nixing all of the options I wanted. You ask me to get it first so we can split the costs. After I get said couch, you tell me ""You know, I think what you buy should just be yours and what I buy should just be mine.""

16. Be my former coworker roommate who then uses the couch way more often than I have ever used it.

17. Be my former coworker roommate who tells me that ""I bring very negative energy"" when I've never heard that from anyone in my entire life.

18. Be my former coworker roommate who when I told you the ballpark of what I make at the company we used to work for, tell me that ""they overpay me for what I do.""

19. Be my former coworker roommate who brings your boyfriend over and then have the boyfriend borrow my boots and don't return them until I ask them if they had it.

20. Be my former coworker roommate who walks in and anytime I'm cooking something, say to me, ""That smells disgusting/gross/bad."" Then when I'm done cooking, ask me ""Can I have some?""

21. Be my former coworker roommate who blames me for not finding someone quickly enough to take over my room when you told me that you would take the reins of finding someone.

22. Be my former coworker roommate who NEVER refills any of the paper towels/toilet paper. Get mad at me for when I ask you to refill it ONCE.

I also know that in order to go to grad school, you need to participate in research and internships as an undergrad. The thing is, I work full time and live off campus and it's REALLY hard to divide time between work, school, and research assisting (volunteer basis at my school, can't get paid to do it), and interning. How do you do it? I'm under the assumption that people who are doing all of these things usually live on campus and don't have to have a full time job. I feel like the system is against me on this one and I'm wondering if I should keep going or switch. It's already pretty late in my college career (~75 credits)."

So in need of a new bong I searched for a similarly shaped one, and found a thicker bong with a triangular reservoir. She's not quite the shape of an Erlenmeyer flask, but she's doing the job alright and as such she was dubbed The Intern.

Ok, so here is the the back story. I am a straight male in my mid 20's and I am working in the deep south for a mid size subtly-christian tech corporation as an intern. I have worked for this company through college and will work for them when I finish my degree. Also my mother is gay so this whole fiasco strikes close to home.

My good friend, we will call him ""Adam"", and I have known each other for around 4 years and we met through an ex of mine. Adam is gay and also happens to be black. 

Adam and I both work and play with technology and are nerds at heart. Adam has worked at this company for almost 5 years and it is just coincidence that we ended up at the same company. We are however in different departments so we don't really hangout much at work but we chat a good bit and it makes cross departmental issues easier to handle when you have friends in said departments.

Recently, in an attempt to bond with my fellow department members, I went out drinking with one of them who seemed to be the most like me from a demographic and general interest point of view. We get to hanging out at the bar and drinking some beer and talking. We will call this friend Dan. 

So Dan and I are just yammering away at conversation and letting loose a bit and he drop in that he smokes herb, which I do as well. This is a good thing because, for me, I feel like this guy trusts me enough to lay that on the line. So with that being said we continue on chatting and joking. I am talking about this and that and I mention that Adam and I are good friends and that we have known each other for a very long time.

Dan, immediately asks, ""Is Adam gay?"" I tell him that I don't really know and that I've never asked. I purposely ignore the question. Fast forward and hour or so... We are knee deep in some beers and he begins to tell me some pretty personal shit that could very well land him in some embarrassing and very hot water. So, I say to myself, I guess this guy is cool enough and obviously trusting enough to know the truth to his question from hours prior. So, I tell him that Adam is gay. 

I think nothing of it and me and my new buddy go on the night drinking, carrying on and even close the bar down. He goes home with some girl I sorta knew in high school and I go home to my girlfriends house. He had a bad time. Like, didn't get any loving and had to watch Dr. Who, kind of a bad time.

I know from this point forward, everything that has happened is completely my fault. I acknowledge this and I wish I could have just kept my mouth shut. I am ashamed. 

So, fast forward to yesterday. I am back at my university and hour away doing my classes. Adam sends me a chat message telling me that guy in his department, who we will call Bill, asked him if Dan has told him anything surprising. We both assume that its something that Dan has told Bill something and he is just blabbering. I ask Dan about what he any Bill might have talked about, not knowing that these two have lunch together sometimes and also play golf. 

I need to mention that Bill is a huge loser. He works with developers but is not one. He has no love life, has no real social skills and comes from a very right wing and very racist family. Huge douche. 

So after talking to Dan I start to realize what may have happened after finding out that these two hang out semi often. I guilt Dan into spilling that he did in fact tell Bill that Adam is gay. I am livid and go on and on about how for one thing this is not a topic that either of us need to tell anyone because it is not ours to tell. Dan instantly realizes how fucking dumb he is for exposing this to anyone, much less Bill, the right wing nut job who works with Adam. Worst part is, he told Bill it was me who told him. Bill knows that Adam and I are friends.


---------------------------------------


**So what should we do? I have come up with two plans so far and have not mentioned to Adam anything at all.** 

* Plan 1:
Have Dan feed Bill several lies about other people over their man-dates and then after a few tell him that all of them, including about Adam being gay, are completely false and were merely a test to see if he is a gossip and trustworthy.

* Plan 2:
Just tell him to keep absolutely mum about it and to not tell a soul. Swear him to complete secrecy and if anything is ever heard that we will know it was him and will fuck him over if at all possible.

----------------------------------

Please help me. I feel awful.

TL;DR: I may have outed my friend at work out to a bunch of christian, republican, racists...

The description is posted below:

We're a Boston-based consumer-web startup, and we're seeking a smart, energetic, and entrepreneurial Growth Hacker. Our mission is to change the world by making it easy for college students to gain the real-world experience they need to create a successful career. We're backed by top-tier Boston angels and have a rockstar team to make this happen. This is a great gig for someone who wants to become familiar with all aspects of the startup process, from product development to business development to community management and marketing to social media.

What’s a Growth Hacker you ask? Here’s the gist: you’re a tech-savvy superstar who loves a challenge. If there’s a problem that needs you to learn basic python to script a solution, you jump at the chance. If our servers are on the fritz and it takes ten minutes to get them back up, you’ll have done it in six. If we’re not populating spreadsheets efficiently enough, you step in with a solution.
Along the way you'll learn everything there is to know -- and more -- about email marketing and managing a hugely popular daily email list.

**Responsibilities:**

• Work 15-40 hours per week from our offices at 40 Berkeley Street in Boston's vibrant South End.

• Help design and implement the tools we need to keep us running smoothly.

• Manage and help design our website.

• Research and recommend ways to automate and streamline our operations.

• Work with a team of talented, passionate people to help fulfill our immense vision.

**Qualifications: (If the following descriptions apply to you, you will be enormously successful here!)**

• Scrappy: You're a GSD person - the type of person who Gets Sh*t Done, no matter what. You're scrappy, entrepreneurial, and highly execution-oriented. Once you're pointed in the right direction, you make things happen with gusto!

• Passionate: You're excited about our mission, a perfectionist in your work, and ready to work hard to help us succeed!

• Techie: You love everything about computers and technology. In your spare time you taught yourself a new scripting language just for fun and you never back down from a challenge.

**Specifically, we’re looking for someone who has experience with linux email servers, the latest scripting languages, PHP, MySQL, Javascript/Jquery, AJAX, creating database backups using Linux Terminal and parsing Excel files into an HTML format. Top notch Excel skills and great documentation habits are also highly desirable.**


Interested? To apply, send me a PM telling me about a problem that you solved and what technologies you implemented. What methods did you try that failed? What did you learn from the project? Write up a paragraph or two about the experience and be sure to highlight your role. What are you waiting for? We're going to change the world (really). Come help us and learn a lot doing it!"

And I'm tired of it.",Lady_Mel,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1755nw/8_months_unemployed_3_years_underemployed_and/,"Last May, I returned to the NYC area from a highly competitive DC internship. Networked in NY for several months. Got new contacts and whatnot. Volunteered at several different NYC tech events. Since early December, I have had several in-person interviews. I made sure that I sent thank you notes to the interviewers and follow up with them via email or by phone. 

Last week, I completed a freelance copywriting project for a local digital marketing agency... but all I hear is silence. The work that I have done for that agency was content for their new website and now I have emailed and left messages and no one wants to contact me. It's like they forgot we were under a contract.....

I've had two prominent in-person interviews and I was supposed to hear back from both parties last week. Nothing... If I did not get the job or second interview, that's fine. I'm used to rejection since I graduated from college in 2009. But at least tell me. I feel like this waiting around is not healthy and that I should be doing something more productive with my time but I can't because I have no source of income and my professional career hangs in the balance. 

I've been patient for over 3 years now, working my ass off. I'm tired of being on hiring managers' and potential employers' Standard Time. I hope daylight savings time comes around the corner so I can move 1 hour forward pass all the BS and lack of genuine concern for long-time underemployed and unemployed Americans who want to work.

Anyone else in the same boat?"

Up 'till yesterday I wasn't noticing improvements from my sadness... so I thought that maybe I should just go to back to fapping.

Yesterday however... I was working at my internship (a class at my high school) at a local business. This girl was shadowing me (I'm not gonna say what we were actually working on for privacy reasons) and I wasn't expecting anybody to come in and help me on the job I was doing. She arrived a bit late and I made a few jokes and we proceeded to working. I was very informative and she seemed receptive to everything I was saying. 

The entire time she thought that I was at this business - gaining college hours. She asked me what my major was and what year I was in and I responded with... ""well, I'm actually in high school."" - she responded with... ""REALLY? I thought you were a junior in college, you are super confident... How old do you think I am?"" I responded very quickly with, ""You're probably in your sophmore year of college."" - she then said ""YES! You're right :) Many people think I'm just freshman in college or a senior in high school.""

After that, we hit it off. We continued to talk, having a great time and talking about where I was planning on going to University, siblings, music, and many other things. 

By the end of our time together, I was assuring her that she would be fine when she began to work on projects by herself.

She then said... ""Are you 18?"" - I laughed ""Yeah, why?"" ""Just wondering..."" she responded, ""This is kind of random but have you played that new Ruzzle game??? You should play me on it!"" So, she proceeded to take my phone, download the app, and add username on it. 

We've been chatting periodically throughout the day, and I doubt that we will go anywhere but it was the best reminder that NOFAP actually *fucking* works... Don't give up guys. You might not see results in the first three days like some people, the first week, or even the first month. Stick with it. Have faith. Use willpower. Change your life. You will NEVER regret it. If you fall, get back up. It makes you stronger and not only do you notice it, but so do others. A fucking sophmore in high school was flirting with me for a solid hour and I'm just a little high schooler. Have the confidence of a *real* man. Don't fap. You are all in my thoughts &amp; prayers. Keep it real.

I'll see her again on Monday so I'll report back in. Until next time...

I'm an intern staff writer for a local small online magazine (I'm not going to mention names to give no publicity). I started a couple of weeks ago and I've submitted two stories already. But to my surprise, the first story was published today under my editor's name. 

We never talked about this, I would have if I had an idea this would happen. This was a mistake in my part, but because the magazine is so small, I didn't think it was necessary to work details out as much.

I asked my editor when my article was going to be published and how it was going to work about a week ago, but the editor never answered.

Then, my article is online, under the editor's name. 

Is this normal behavior? What should I do?
I don't like this a bit.

Thanks.

tl;dr: My editor published my article under his name. I'm an intern. What should I do?"

174zhr,37,2013-01-23,I[22m] just found out my gf[23f] of one year is still in love with and dreams of her ex-boyfriend and we live together. ,JustinLATFH,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/174zhr/i22m_just_found_out_my_gf23f_of_one_year_is_still/,"I know this is similar to other posts on r/relationships, but please bear with me. Should I stay or should I go folks? 

We entered into an intimate and exclusive relationship early last year and have been together ever since. I had just come out of an 8 month relationship and had no intention of dating or finding anyone else when I met her. She hadn't dated anyone or been in an official relationship in a long time and had a lot of issues with past boyfriends, including, but not limited to insecurity and trust issues. 

The first few months were amazing of course during the honeymoon phase, but right around 5 or six months things started to become more difficult as we transitioned to living together the beginning of August of last year. Living together made sense for financial reasons and practical reasons as she works insane hours in a paid internship as an assistant athletic trainer for the local university's football and gymnastics team. When we started living together many of the issues started to come out. She couldn't seperate the stress from her work and brought it into our relationship. 

We started having less and less sex, causing me to become insecure because our sex life used to be incredible. I tried everything I could to make her life easier and to regain her love and affection. Cooking all her meals, packing her lunches, driving her to work at 6 a.m., doing all of the cleaning and house chores, taking on a majority of our financial responsibilities, and sacrificing my school agenda to help her. Each of my roomates (male and female) see how much she abuses my love and kindness in the relationship, by picking petty fights with me and being controlling in a number of ways. I used to be fun, spontaneous, highly extroverted, and happy go lucky. Now this relationship has turned me into a shell of my former self. 

Recently, I've become paranoid and looked through her phone to find answers as to why she is no longer loving and affectionate towards me. I know this was an extreme breach of trust and unnacceptible on my part, but I was desperate to find answers. That's when I've come to find that she still dreams of and is still in love with her ex-boyfriend from Scottland in spite of her telling me she wants to marry me someday and how we've discussed a future together with kids. I'm at a loss, I love her so much but this pit in my stomache won't go away. Should I confront her, apologize for breaching her trust, and then suggest counseling or should I cut ties and focus on myself, my education, and the future?

TL;DR Confused of my girlfriends behavior and paranoid to find answers to the problems in our relationship I searched my girlfriends phone and found texts to one of her best friends describing how she's still in love with her ex and dreams of him in spite of her stating that she's in love with me and wants us to be married in the future.

the level of comfort in hell, and began designing and building

Basically, I'm better at math than her. Her specilization is topography, and I'm even better at that. She's not an idiot, but she is an incredibly average student (3ish gpa, an internship but no good research/top industry experience, etc.)   I routinely point out mistakes in her papers and homework. She's grateful, but I think it's hurting her self-confidence. In fact, up until this year, I tutored her in many of her subjects (starting with calc 2 first semester, which is where we met.)

But it's not just in math, it's in pretty much every subject. I'm not trying to be showy, just trying to describe the situation. I'm better at language(s), music, science, writing, literature, history, philosophy... I could go on.

I still have to catch up to various courses I haven't yet completed before I'd be eligible, and while it's all pretty manageable (it's not a *lot* of work to catch up to), it's not a ""just one thing"" type of deal. Things aren't looking good. I'm getting the definite answer next week, but the writing is on the wall. 

This wouldn't be so much of a problem in itself if it weren't for the fact that I have two failed years behind me. By the time I graduate, I'll have spent 6,5 years completing a 4-year college course and all that repeated failure really gets to me. I feel so hopeless and worthless, and I don't know how I'm supposed to talk to my parents about it (who I know have had gradually adjusted their expectations of me in the last year, and undoubtly think of me as a disappointment - at the very least, I know my dad does). 

So I'm now dealing with the emotional fallout of this being about to happen, and how to bring it to my parents. I'm living with them right now (figured I might as well for the last half year, right? Ahaha--) I'm right now looking for a place to move into, because I sure as hell don't want to face them every day after they find out. (Would this be a good decision?)

Another problem is, what to do those six months? I could look into a job, (and this isn't an idea but a necessity if I find a place of my own), but I've also started to realise that in those six and a half years of being a student, I haven't actually done much exciting student-y stuff. I haven't done any of the internships or minors abroad that I really wanted to do; either my parents or the school have prevented me from doing those. Maybe this is a wildly inappropriate time to think about it... but I would really like to travel. It would turn a whole batch of lemons into some pretty sweet lemonade. 

Lastly, there is of course the implications for after I graduate. My dad (he's super demanding) has told me, after failing the first year, that my future employers would notice this on my resumé and would judge it infavorably. After failing a year on top of that he has pretty much given up all hope of me ever getting a decent job. And well, my dad's a grade-A pessimist and has been his entire life, so I know I have to take his answers with a grain of salt. But still, just how fucked am I?

I have a nice job lined up for graduation in May of 2014. I also have a nice job lined up for this summer. I want to just get a head start on managing my finances as I have a lofty, expensive goal.

To start, I have no college loans as I was fortunate that my parents are able to pay it all for me. I currently have ~$3.5k in savings that I can't touch without hassle, and ~$3k in a savings/checking that I can get at easily. I am in a fraternity and have dues covered in a separate account specifically for that. I will make about ~$4k this summer after living expenses and such at an internship. The job I have lined up will pay ~$70k a year before taxes in Northern Virginia, an expensive area. A one bedroom apartment is around ~1100 a month there, for perspective. It is a 9-5 desk job. I am single and have no dependents of any sort.

Now, what I really want some help with. Aside from the job I have lined up for graduation, I want to become a helicopter pilot. There are two options for this for me: 1) Get a Private Pilots license and fly for fun at a cost of ~$12k for the PPL and ~$300 an hour afterwards or 2) Become a Certified Flight Instructor at a cost of ~$60k. The benefit of being a flight instructor is that most/all of my flying after that point is free, and I get paid a bit for teaching. Also, I could use this as a fallback incase I get laid off or as a relaxing job for retirement. If I choose the PPL route, I can pay the $12k in cash when the time comes and I have that in savings. My questions are about the CFI route.

That said, I realize this will be a huge expense in my life. What is the best way I can save for this, barring any huge changes in my life? Is there anything I should be doing immediately with the ~$10-12k I have in savings? Would it be worth it to take out a loan a year or so after college for $60k to become a CFI if I choose that route (after I have an emergency fund and such)? Would it make more sense to wait till I have ~5 years out of college before attempting this and take out a more reasonable loan, or just wait till I can pay it in cash? 

Basically, what is the ideal way to go about saving for a known, huge expense like this?"

I was naive and stupid and made assumptions on student loans thinking my highest interest rate was 6.8% and I was excited to start a Roth IRA with the extra money I was making.  I donated 400 a month to it and put in $4000 before December.  After finally accepting a job offer I started to get serious about figuring out a budget and that included checking out the loans my parents got me so I was able to go to school.  I then realized my highest interest rate was 7.9% and that I had been accumulating interest on all my loans for the last 4 years of school.  I immediately wanted to pay down the interest that way it would not compound on me when I needed to start payment on my loans.  Thankfully I have a great job and the standard 6 months before I have to start paying off the loans.  I researched taking out an IRA early and discovered that you can take it out with no penalties if it is for educational costs.

My questions are:

1:  How do I take out the IRA without penalty to pay interest on my student loans?

2:  Is this indeed the correct way to proceed?  Seeing how it is very hard to make 7.9% in the market, and the way I see it, I would not borrow money to invest to begin with.

On a side note, I am an idiot for trying to start an IRA without taking a closer look at ALL of my student loans.  Through the course of college I just let my parents handle my loans since they got me parent plus loans."

I love film and the storytelling qualities that come with the cut, as well as with sound. The few times I've been in an editing room working till morning hours are times I can look back on and say I was truly happy doing that. 

Right now I'm in Chicago and just finished my first year of classes (foundations courses, nothing with editing) and it was horrible. I'm sure it gets better but I have no scholarships and I'm not convinced the money is worth spending. The alternative is to try it on my own but that path is a lot scarier and without clear-cut paths, perhaps for the better, but it's still stressing the hell out of me.

Is there potential for an unpaid internship at an editing/motion graphics house for an amateur like me or must I find my own way first working for free and editing projects for film students before I thicken up my reel to send to potential employers?

I have submitted an application for transfer to McGill University.. the only drawback is that at my current school I could potentially graduate in 3 years, as opposed to if I go to McGill where I would require the 4th with a B.A./B.S.

I've also considered just sticking this school out, then taking a one-year masters program (I was also wondering if people could recommend good programs that are tailored towards this industry) effectively getting a B.S., B.A., and one-year masters in 4 years.

TL;DR: I go to a no-name school. Internships? I am considering transferring. Would going to McGill for 4 years instead of this school for 3 be better for my employment and career prospects?

Sorry for the lengthy post. I'd appreciate anybody's input."

Will passing a CPA exam guarantee me a full time job? Is CPA beneficial for someone with no experience in auditing? Is it worth spending $3.3k and ~6 months to study for it at this point?

173wvi,0,2013-01-23,Do you enjoy MegaMan? So do I.,J-dazzy,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/173wvi/do_you_enjoy_megaman_so_do_i/,"Hello everyone,


I'd like to ask a few questions regarding a project I am going to be beginning quite soon. I am hoping to receive some advice from more experienced developers and enthusiasts to aid me in a few decisions. First and foremost, let me introduce myself. My name is Jordan Curd. I am currently a senior at NCSU, majoring in Computer Science and concentrating in Game Development. Although I've spent much of my life dabbling in game development, I had the opportunity to work at an indie dev in the Raleigh, NC area last summer. They are called Mighty Rabbit Studios and are the creators of Saturday Morning RPG, a JRPG currently for the iOS, but soon to be available on Android and Steam. I developed in Unity3D, but in the past, I used mainly Digipen's in-house game engine called ProjectFUN. I attended their summer sessions when I was a teenager and received access to it, so I spent a number of years making small-scale games with it. I have spent most of my college career learning and using Java and C/C++. I learned to use C# at my internship (not a big leap from C++), and I also learned to use PHP, MySQL, and a little bit of Javascript. Also, I've used GameMaker before.


While working at Mighty Rabbit, I had the opportunity to represent them at a games expo in Philadelphia called Too Many Games. While there, I noticed an overwhelming theme of MegaMan. Everything was MegaMan. The name tags had Dr. Wily's castle as a backdrop. The DJ constantly played remixed MegaMan songs. Every booth had something to sell of MegaMan. And let me tell ya, I love MegaMan. It is, by far, my favorite video game series. I love everything about the series, and I feel that my enjoyment of the games doesn't require any explanation... everyone can appreciate MegaMan! Anyways, I had 9-10 hours of driving home after the Too Many Games expo where I couldn't get all of that MegaMan stuff out of my head. People love it. I love it. Why don't I make a fan game?


I concocted a game idea during that drive. When I returned, I started writing a game design doc. This thing turned out to be 30+ pages. I then created another document and wrote the entire storyline. I created a few more documents before I found myself swimming in a pool of documents with, what I think, are brilliant and unique ideas for a fan game. I have this thing entirely planned out, and it would work. By God it would work. I've played with the idea of ditching the MegaMan universe and creating something of my own, but I can't get that expo out of my mind. I feel that the market for a MegaMan game is huge. I'm not after money with this project, the money will come later in my career. This isn't about money, this is about sharing my idea and love for the series with everyone. 


I originally took my idea away with Unity. I am comfortable with Unity and I wanted the challenge of creating a 2D game with an engine made for 3D. I like challenge. I ended up getting a pretty decent MegaMan engine going. If you were to limit MegaMan to one room with enemies, my engine worked for that. I was on my way. Well, one busy semester and two hard-drive crashes later, my Unity project exists no more. With this misfortune, I am starting fresh, and I am not using Unity. Although I'm comfortable with Unity and I enjoy the challenge, I feel that using a different engine that is more catered to what I want to do would speed up development and would allow for a much more rapid iteration schedule.


Here are my questions:


* What are your thoughts about a MegaMan fan game? Would it be worth it? Would I receive the infamous ""Cease and Desist"" letter? I've heard that Capcom is lenient on fangames, but does anyone have experience with fangames?


* Are there any game engines that come to mind with my experiences and game concept? I know that GameMaker can be limiting, but I have experience with it and was therefore thinking of using it. What would you use instead?


* What is your opinion of the fangame vs. my own universe? As stated, money isn't my intention with this game. However, some of you may have experience with this and can shed some light on this subject.


* If you're interested, would you care to hear my game idea? :)


Thank you all ahead of time. This is my first time posting here, but I look forward to positing in the future! Also, I apologize if these types of posts are frequent. I searched a bit of /r/gamedev and didn't see anything too similar."

I felt the need to share, I'm not sure why. I used to only fap once a week just because it felt better. I had weeded the bad behavioral stuff out for the most part (I mean I did because I felt horny, not because I was bored), but I did it because I usually failed at working up the nerve to approach at the bar that weekend and I have a few women I met online who I could cyber with. But I do not want to do that anymore. I've gone as long as 2.5 weeks, and in some of my longer stretches, I do remember feeling more relaxed and more confident. I want and need that extra intrinsic and biological motivation to continue to exercise, feel more confident, and actually fuck and not fap.

My life is currently really stressful right now because I have work, internship, and classes and I have succumbed to depression and boredom fapping. But I refuse to keep falling back on short term solutions to long term problems (or things that need long term solutions-reframe). I saw a post about mindfulness yesterday and it really resonated with me today because I did a small, but stupid thing at work because I was being mindless. That post came into my head as soon as I realized what I did. I plan on using NoFap for awhile, and I have a lot more things to post/discuss. But in the effort of avoiding a brick of text, I will stop here. I only request that if I feel myself starting to slip and I post about it here, that my fellow Fapstronauts help see me through it.

During the interview and the offer, the word they used for the position was ""job.""

During his first week of work, his new boss came up and told him that they wanted to pretend he is and/or classify him as an ""intern"" so that he can file taxes on his 1099 as an independent contractor, instead of filling out a W2. They said they were doing this for his benefit, so that he could write off his transportation costs on his taxes.

None of this sounds too kosher to me though. It seems pretty clear to me that they want to do things this way so that they don't have to contribute social security or pay unemployment if they fire him, etc.

Two(ish) questions:

1. Is there anything legally suspect about what the company is doing? Is it fraud to hire somebody as an employee and then turn around and classify them as an intern? And fraud against *whom*? My friend, or the government, or both?

2. My friend is frankly just happy to be getting paid, and doesn't care much what goes on with the paperwork. He doesn't want to make a fuss here. But if the company ever got audited, could my friend be liable in all this? Is he complicit for playing along, assuming something rotten is going on?

I'm 24. I graduated with my BS in Early Childhood Ed (Elementary Ed) a year ago, and I have my license. Since I graduated I've gotten engaged and moved in with my SO. I never thought of teaching as my dream job, and really only entered the field after a suggestion from my father. My first time observing in a classroom I fell in love with the idea of being a teacher. When I was in my Education classes, I was so passionate about being a teacher. I was still in love with teaching when I did my semester of internship in a Kindergarten class. I would've loved to have worked in the school I interned at (which is easily a few hundred miles from where I live now). I was jealous when my classmates started posting on Facebook about getting their dream jobs as teachers.

So here I am, a year later, and I don't feel the spark and excitement like I used to when I thought about having a class of my own. I feel like this was a relationship and we grew apart. I am so confused. I have been substitute teaching lately, and I don't hate it, but I definitely don't love it. I keep telling everyone that I hope I get a teaching position in the city I'm living in, but I'm pretty much saying what they want to hear. At this point I couldn't care less if I teach. I feel like I could pursue any other profession and be just as happy. My mom told me the other day that even though I'm not loving substituting, that she's never thought I was in the wrong field. She says it's obvious I'm passionate about Education, and to an extent I know I am. I just don't understand why I am feeling this way now! I remember when I was excited to be a teacher, and that I wanted it more than anything, but I haven't felt that way in nearly 6 months.

Has anyone ever felt this way and ended up going into that job anyway? How did it turn out? Did you feel this way about a job, find other employment, and wish you'd stuck with your original plan? I guess I'm just wanting whatever advice, or similar stories you wise ladies (and men) have. Thanks!"

Neve Shalom/ Wahat al Salam is a cooperative community jointly founded by Israeli Jews and Israeli Palestinian Arabs to show that they can live peacefully together. It is an unpaid internship, but I'm mainly going for the experience. I feel as if this opportunity will allow me to get my foot in the door for the field of conflict resolution research / nonprofit organizations.

To tell you a little bit about myself, I'm a 23 year old male Korean-American, recently graduated with a B.A. in psychology with minors in political science and peace &amp; conflict studies. I'm a HIP (Help Increase the Peace by American Friends Service Committee[1] ) trainer and I hope to bring what I've learned through schooling and experience to this internship. I also have some ideas in education and dialog I hope to develop but I understand I have a lot to learn before I can actualize my ideas. In the future I hope to be in grad school and then eventually go for my doctorate but for now, working for nothing and learning whatever I can from wherever I can is my goal.

Anyway, I got an email from the communications and development coordinator asking me to begin looking for funding sources for my housing (I guess I'm being seriously considered). It would come out to about 3,000 USD for my 6 month stay. So today, I come to you reddit, to ask you for your advice. I've helped with project planning and fundraising for rotaract (rotary) in the past to expand a cramped school in Monrovia, Liberia but I've never had to look/ask for funding for myself from organizations. Any advice or leads on where to start or how to go about doing this would help immensely. Grants/funding opportunities directly related to the conflict field would be even better. This is new ground for me and could use a little hand holding.

I've posted this in a couple subreddits over the past few days but I haven't receive any ideas.

I am given basic tasks to do (obviously this is exactly what I was expecting and not disappointing in any way shape or form) and I do them to the best of my abilities. Unfortunately for me, the best of my abilities is much better than the team expected and I complete most of the data entry and excel work quite quickly as I have spent a considerable amount of my spare time at school learning how to be very efficient (not just hotkeys, but also macros). I can understand why this could be frustrating as the person giving me work as they have to carve out more time to give me work and think about what I can do. After talking to friends who have done the winter internship before they were all a little bit more involved and did tasks that were a lot more time consuming because in the past there was no real limit for overtime for interns while this year they have a fairly strict limit on overtime giving basically none(despite the fact that we were told we would be working 50-60 hours a week but that's beside the point).

In the end my question is what should I do? Should I intentionally take longer to complete my tasks because the senior is clearly a little frustrated that I am finishing them quickly (even though I'm finishing them quickly I still review everything and it is all high quality and in most cases more than what she is expecting)? I'm just unsure about how I should approach the situation and any advice is much appreciated."

My boss had me work up to 100 hours a week on critical software, then fired me. Almost a year has passed. What should I do?


I worked as an unpaid intern writing code for a lab at a university for four months last year (Nov. 2011 - Feb. 2012). There was a student in charge of the lab who was attempting to spin off a start-up company. For the first month, I worked about 24 hours a week and held a part-time job. Then in December, my boss had the team go on a programming ""retreat"" out at his parents boat-house which was a week straight of 14-16 hours of non-stop programming. My boss had already mentioned that he could start paying me when he got funding (as early as March), but during the retreat he mentioned that he was working to get funding through the university sooner.

By the end of December I had received a job offer for a tech support company, but my boss told me that if I declined that job offer, he would start paying me out of pocket ($900/month) until he could pay me a full salary. I agreed to decline the job offer because I thought the work being done at the lab was a much more compelling career.

When January started, my boss had just completed the paperwork for his company and my workload quickly became overwhelming. I was working 80 hours a week until the last week of January when I pulled a 100 hour week. I was building and testing a key component of our product and we had to demonstrate our work by the end of the month. I was paid $600 for that month.

In the first two and a half weeks of February, I was assigned a research task. I was to write code and test a new motion segmentation technique. Then I was moved to re-factoring code, then I was assigned a new feature to code. In the last week of February, I was told that I was going to be classified as a ""visiting scholar"" so that I could be paid by the University (I was not enrolled at the university at this time). That never happened, though, because my boss fired me for inadequate performance. I worked about 60 hours a week in February. I was paid $800. The research I conducted was published, but I got no recognition for my work.

I was not in a good financial situation when i started the job and I was pretty much financially ruined afterward. I had to take a crappy job immediately after being fired to keep my head above water. Now I've recovered enough to start thinking about taking legal action.

I know Texas is a right to work state, but I'm pretty sure the laws regulating unpaid interns are Federal and that my employer violated them. Based on my (novice) interpretation of the law, my previous employer owes me ~$30,000. I'm not very keen on dragging the university into a legal battle, just my boss. What should I do?"

177sfs,1,2013-01-24,Badly need your guys' help with finding an editing job.,Kevin_0089,editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/177sfs/badly_need_your_guys_help_with_finding_an_editing/,"Hello fellow editors, need some serious help with finding my first editing job and I feel that you guys might be able to give me excellent advice.  Some background info first:


Basically, I self taught myself video editing using Sony Vegas back in 2007 and have loved the software and the art of editing ever since. When I graduated high school in 2008, I decided to take my passion to the next level and study film editing in college. While in college, the schools I attended taught us Final Cut Pro and Avid Media Composer.  In 2010, I graduated from Pennsylvania College of Technology with a Associates Degree in Mass Media Communications and decided to continue my education for my Bachelor's in film.  I got into the School of Visual Arts in NYC in the fall of 2010 but unfortunately decided to leave once the first year came to an end because I felt that the tuition was too high for me right now (it was $40,000 a year to attend).  Not letting that get me down, I found through a friend a school in NYC (called Manhattan Edit Workshop) that allows you to get certified in Final Cut Pro and Avid Media Composer through a 6-week course.  I took the course from Nov. - Dec. 2011 and since graduating have been on the job hunt ever since...  Well, kind of.


If job hunting this past year has taught me anything, it's that more and more people are wanting you to know After Effects or Motion aside from knowing just how to edit.  I got basic experience with After Effects during MEWS 6-week course and I started to learn Motion during an internship in early 2010.  Truthfully (and I'm kicking myself now that I didn't do this last year), I should have kept up with the After Effects training once the 6-week course ended.  I didn't though and because of it, my confidence in looking for my first real editing job dropped and I automatically became nervous and diffident when I would see jobs on Craigslist and Mandy requiring it.  To put it bluntly, I really haven't applied to any post production jobs in the past year as I should have (I at least could have done it for the experience of the interview process and seeing what people want in terms of editing jobs).  I did temporarily last year do videography/editing for my local Remax Real Estate branch, which I'll explain below.


About 6 months ago, I found work at the local ReMax branch office near where I live through a friend of mine (they were looking for a videographer/editor to create house tour videos). When I got the job, I upgraded from a laptop to a new desktop when I found out they were using Vegas to cut their tours. I shot my first (and only) house in September and since then, they haven't really initiated any other projects and the job hasn't panned out as I had hoped it would. Basically, that puts us at the present.  I am still looking for my first real editing job and I have an almost brand new PC that is more than capable of tackling any editing work.


Where do I go from here? I should add that in the past year, I have tried posting on my area's Craigslist (Allentown, PA) a few times but have gotten nothing out of that.  Is it possible to actually get work with the limited knowledge of After Effects that I have?  A few days ago, I started to get acquainted to the interface again through tutorials on videocopilot.net and have been making decent progress.  In the jobs that do require After Effects experience, what about the program gets used most in the professional setting?  Also, is it even possible to make a living working from home because of my scenario with the new workstation I recently got?  I guess I'll fill you in on the details of the workstation since it's probably relevant.  It's simply a Dell XPS 8500 tower with a 1tb harddrive, 8gb of ram, and a NVIDIA 640 GT with 1 gb of DDR5 for the graphics card.  At this point, truthfully, I'll settle with anything (post-production house or working from home).  I'll also say that my editing skills are just slightly below the advanced level (definitely above intermediate).  Just wondering if you fellow editors could shed some light on my situation and who knows, maybe this could be a networking opportunity for me.  If anyone has any further questions with anything above, let me know and I'll be glad to answer them.

**TL;DR:  Self taught myself editing and went through some college for it, but still don't have a job after a year.  Any advice?  Is knowing alot of After Effects necessary?**"
177rci,5,2013-01-24,Assistant Controller: question,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/177rci/assistant_controller_question/,"Hello,

I just have a quick question. I currently work for the government. A friend of mine notified me of an assistant controller position at a local plant - and on paper I qualify for the job: Bachelor's degree in Accounting, 4 years of accounting experience, and a Big 4 internship. All of my accounting work has been in tax, however. I am a few hours from CPA eligibility (due to life and debt), but the job does not require one.

I realize a lot of the questions in here involve the CPA exam and public accounting but any info would be appreciated.

So:

- If you hold or have held this position, what was your background coming in? How many years of experience did you have? What type of accounting did you do before coming in?

- Did you have experience preparing financials? Did you learn most of the law and regs specific to your municipality/state on the job or were you expected to know beforehand?

- Did you have experience in payroll?

- Was management experience something you had or wish you had? How essential would you say it is?

- Probably a million other things I didn't think of.

- Did you have any tax experience, and did this help you or hinder you in any way?

I'm probably entirely outclassed due to my age and lack of further qualifications, but my friend is insisting I interview for it - it's a smaller, more relaxed company. So I'm giving it some definite thought. Any answers to the above questions or additional advice would be appreciated."

This is basically me asking for advice. I chose to post in /r/atheism because it's the only subreddit I 'religiously' follow, and I've truly enjoyed the support given to people who post their stories, usually accompanied by brilliant pieces of advice. For privacy's sake, I've refrained from naming people and institutions.

I'm an Iranian, born and raised in a secular family. When I was a teenager I left Iran along with my mother and moved to Cyprus, while my father stayed in Iran to look after his business. There was absolutely no future for me in Iran; An atheist whose extended family had ties to Shah's regime. While we were not rich, we still managed to make ends meet.

When I graduated high school, I enrolled in the Biology programme at a university in Nicosia, Cyprus. A couple of years later I co-founded the Skeptics Society with a friend and helped set up the Biology Society, and was involved in organizing events for guest speakers for both societies. Academically, things were going very well.
My problems started at the beginning of my 3rd year. My family went bankrupt. Although, I was not told about any of that until my family had no choice but to sell everything back home and move in with relatives. To top things off, I also lost my part-time job as a waiter due to a new law that was passed, banning unskilled non-Europeans from working in restaurants and bars. I had absolutely no source of income left. Needless to say, my tuition debt to the university was building up.

I managed to score a part time job at the university library which helped with paying off a small portion of my debt. At the end of my 3rd year I had a 13,000-Euro debt to the university (and that's including my partial scholarship). The only reason I was allowed to attend my 4th year classes and do my B.Sc. thesis was because the head of my department had stepped in on my behalf, making a case for me by presenting the school counsel with my grades and my contribution to the societies as well as the Science Department (I was a regular article writer for the department magazine).

My plan was to finish my degree, and get a job as a skilled non-EU national to pay off my debt. The university had told me that while they will not grant me my degree until I settle my debt, they're willing to give me a letter  confirming that I've finished my degree to allow me to get a job. A couple of months before graduation I managed to get an internship at a pharmaceutical company. They said they would hire me once I graduated.
Just as I thought things were looking up, Cyprus passed a new law which pretty much killed all my chances of getting hired. The law basically said regardless of qualification, priority goes to EU nationals for skilled jobs. And that was it. My best chance of paying my debt was gone.

Later I found out that my university was hiring lab assistants, so I had a talk with the administration proposing that I could work for them to settle my debt. They refused, because ""getting me a work permit was too much hassle"". So I tried one last thing; tutoring. I put up fliers around the campus, only to get a call a few days later from the university saying that I was not allowed to put up fliers about tutoring because the university offers free tutoring. I asked them if they'd like to hire me as a tutor and I was turned down, again.


So that's basically it. I cannot work in Cyprus under any circumstance, and I cannot work anywhere else for that matter without my degree until I pay my 21,000-Euro debt. Going back to Iran is not an option. Not only will I be oppressed for the rest of my life with threat of death for apostasy hanging over my head, the highest paying job I'm certified to do in Iran is teaching English which pays around 450 Euros/month: that's only 100 euros less than what my Civil Engineer cousin earns in Iran. Only skilled, full-time jobs would allow me to earn enough money to settle my debt and earn my degree in 2-3 years.

To top everything off, my visa expires in less than 3 months, forcing me to go back to Iran.

What do you suggest I do? What would you do in my situation? I'm ashamed to say I was even thinking of organizing an online fundraiser, asking redditors to donate if they could. But I'm not sure how people would react to that.

Please help me. I'm at the end of my rope.

177nio,2,2013-01-24,I have a client who does not want to pay the amount we agreed upon. Shoot is already done. Thoughts?,tom_edit,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/177nio/i_have_a_client_who_does_not_want_to_pay_the/,"It's hard to summarize this, but I expect no one would want to read all the complete emails, so I'll do my best.

A potential client is referred to me by a previous client of mine. We decide on the price of $200 for a one-day shoot of two speaking engagements with b-roll starting ""at 10 AM"". 

At 10:35 PM the night before the shoot, I still don't have an address for the venue, so I email the client. Client responds with address and says he will be getting to the venue at 8:30 AM and that he ""hopes"" I can be there at that time as well.

Misunderstanding this as a request to arrive as early as possible for the 10 AM talk (because of the previous email), and having no one to watch my 10-month-old son at the new time, I respond with a ""thank you"" and a ""see you tomorrow"". 

I leave as early as I can and am ready to shoot at 9:45 AM. Apparently my client had already started speaking 20 minutes prior to my arrival and there was no way for me to put a lav on him as planned, or film him from the front and center position, so I used an H4N recording ambient sound and shot him in profile instead for the rest of his talk.

I explained the situation again to the client (I had passed a message on to him through an intern before I arrived) and he seemed to understand.

The second talk and b-roll went fine.

Upon delivering the footage to the client with synced audio, the client now has decided because I did not get the full first talk with on-body sound that he does not want to pay the agreed-upon amount. 

I politely stated my case that the only thing that prevented this was the bad communication on his part and the fact that he had changed the time at the last minute. He doesn't care, and wants to pay a reduced amount. The amount we agreed upon is a flat-rate for the day, not hourly.

So what are your thoughts? I have had clients who didn't want to pay me in the past and their method was to ignore me. I got them to pay me eventually but this case is different. I don't engage in bickering or hostility about every little detail when I believe the other person is at fault. 

Thanks for reading! I'd appreciate any insight anyone has to offer."

     A few days ago I posted an album of my food with the title that stated I'm 17 years old and want to go to culinary school. When it got slightly popular, almost every comment was about how I should not go to culinary school, and it's a waste of 40k, stuff like that. Then one redditor said that I should go around town to various chefs and see what they think. So that's what I did. Almost every one of them agreed it was a bad idea. So last night while out at dinner at a local restaurant with a chef's bar (where you can watch them cook and talk to them) I got into a conversation with him and he eventually offered me a job and an internship there! So next week I am officially starting my new career as a dishwasher and interning as a prep cook!
     Thank you so much for the many people on here that set me on the right path!

My major is undeclared, and I'm mostly just hashing out my gen-ed classes. Past posts recommend to go out and network, which I plan to do with my local Sierra Club chapter.

* What majors and minors would be most beneficial to receiving a job in this field?

* What colleges have good programs in said majors, that are somewhat affordable? I'm not going to put a specific price on ""affordable"", but on the topic of money...

*  [An instate College](http://joomla.wildlife.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=486&amp;Itemid=297) may be the cheapest option. Which of these colleges have a ""good name"" in forrest conservation? Or where would be the best place to research on said college.

* What are some other, and better, ways to network before I could do some internships?

* Although I would be glad to help with the forests, I specifically want to work with wolves. What would be the best way to ensure I'm working with these animals?

I'm not a US citizen or permanent resident so I can't put things in a 401k and I'm not sure I'm allowed to open a Roth IRA (any knowledge on this would be much appreciated actually). What would people recommend I do with it? I'll probably return to the US in the future.

I plan on travelling to New Zealand in the fall for which I'll need 4k set aside (as part of the work travel visa requirements). I don't actually intend to dip into that money and hope to freelance while I'm there to earn enough to live on. I just need to be able to prove I have it. 

Aside from that I've saved up about 10k GBP in the UK and it's honestly just sitting there. I could transfer it so that it's all in one place, but maybe it makes sense to keep it there? I'm also afraid of costs when it comes to wiring it to another account. 

I've thought about buying property in the UK, but my income isn't consistent enough to pay off a mortgage.

On top of all of that I'm Belgian, my parents are there and I've talked to them about buying property there and having them manage it for me.

177bfd,2,2013-01-24,Nightly Woes: Work-Related and Life-Related Rant,JenovaCelestia,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/177bfd/nightly_woes_workrelated_and_liferelated_rant/,"I used to love the company I work for. I really did. I liked it so much that in all my working life, I've only ever worked there. The last place I worked at was exceptionally great; a very understanding owner, good managers, fun coworkers who also got their fair share of work done.

And then there's the place I'm currently employed at. I left my last job to move to Tiny Town. Tiny Town has a population of less than 100,000. Compared to the town I left behind, this is tiny. I didn't want to move here. My boyfriend had gotten an internship through the university here; it pays well and it will do wonders for him after graduating. He asked me while still obtaining the internship to move out here, to which I was rebelliously declining at every opportunity. I knew I wouldn't be happy out here. And besides, what was I going to do once it was done and I need to go back to Town A? I couldn't live with my dad again. In my eyes, there was more benefit for him than me.

Eventually, I caved. Don't ask me why I did. I couldn't really tell you why other than I was kicked out of my dad's- well, not really kicked out; more like he asked me to move out so his girlfriend can move in (which never happened)- and I had nowhere else to go. Plus, my boyfriend was lonely out here. So out of a mix of pity and lack of other options, I moved here mid-July.

I found a job by the end of August. It was the same company; a night shift coffee serving job. It was a steady 40 hours a week at a higher pay rate than I was getting in Town A, so I couldn't really complain. Or so I thought at first.

On my first day there, I knew I made a mistake in taking the job. I was being trained- this is a misnomer; it was more like they were telling me what I'm supposed to do and not do as I've already worked the job before- by someone who doesn't even regularly work the night shift hours. And they've only worked it once. That's right; only once. They were also spraying for bugs that night. Gritting my teeth, I proceeded to work and show them what I could do. So ended my first night there.

The next day I was to work there, it only cemented my fears: I was told I was the ONLY person for the entire night shift staff- so 6 other people- who didn't call in sick. And it was a party weekend for the university. After talking to the supervisors and my new coworkers, I found this is a regular occurrence; their night shift staff are notoriously unreliable and sometimes don't even show up to work without prior notice. As such, my new coworkers lumped me in with that bunch as well as my lack of going to the local university. Their snobbish attitude alienated me from the start. In fact, it's only really recently they've been kinder to me.

Since that time, I've wanted to quit this job. My boyfriend even begged me at one point to do so, insisting he made enough to support me until I could find a new one. But my pride won out; I assured him I could last and everything would be okay. How wrong I was.

I have been working there for 5 months so far and it has gotten to the point I can't even muster the strength to go to work anymore. Because of my pride and my over-attention to detail, I am now labelled as the most reliable night shift person. Essentially, I get all the extra work and my options of scheduling days off has taken a turn for the worst. The added bonus for all of this is if I call in sick or if I don't do that extra cleaning, I get yelled at.

Minor story time: I was sick with a medium-grade fever. I called in sick and told them I would have a doctor's note. The manager told me I am now unreliable and essentially said that I better show up to my shifts coming up or else. Yet, my coworkers- my fellow night owls- can call in sick without any hassle whatsoever. Hell, there's a woman I work with that takes frequent extended leaves of absence for mental health reasons. I'm mindful of mental health as much as the next person, but this is getting ridiculous: she will say she can work, then call in sick that day. She needs to sort her self out and get real help, but she refuses. 

Because of this job, I lost sight of what's important in my life: happiness. My friends from Town A rarely speak to me now; either because I'm asleep when they're awake or because I'm conceived to be too much of a downer because I vent my work-related stress onto them. They also- from what I can see- are annoyed I work all the time and can't see them. 

You know where you work is bad when you spend about 2 hours crying to yourself about your job and how much joy it sucks out of your life. On that day, I have resolved to quit this job and find a new one; one where I can work and still have time to be happy. My boyfriend has mixed feelings on it; he feels I should try to last until June or find a new job first. But because of my job, that's not really an option.

I've been applying to pretty much anything I qualify for - dev, QA, help desk jobs etc. I've got an interview for junior QA positions coming up, at a company that I'd love to work for, but based on what I've heard I'm a little worried about the stigma that some people who worked in QA have faced in the past when applying for jobs in development.

As it's my first internship (out of a required 4) should I take what I can get, focus on building up my own programming portfolio and then be a little more choosy for my second internship, or should I hold out and try to get an actual programming gig now? I know it wouldn't look as good on my resume to future employers as an actual dev job would (presuming I'm applying to a dev job) but I imagine it's better than not having any relevant experience in the field at all. 

The company I'm applying to also has a reputation of being very understanding and good to its co-ops, and offering them future opportunities in other positions. I don't know if writing automated test scripts would be involved, but the posting listed .NET programming as an ideal qualification so I imagine I may at least see some live code at some point.

Also, would I be more likely to land a junior dev internship at the same company at a later date if I already have experience working with their product in a QA situation?

EDIT: Had my interview about an hour ago, they specifically told me they train their co-ops in QA first, then move them into software development for future co-op terms after further training. Sounds promising!"

What should be my next step?,NotEmployed,Switzerland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/176twc/unable_to_find_a_fulltime_job_after_15_years/,"Dear Swiss Redditors

Well, the title already describes my problem. I am unable to find a job in Switzerland. 

I am 21 years old and had my graduation as a trader one and a half years ago. I haven't had much job experience during and after my apprenticeship, which seems to be a major problem for me.

Also, I'm not specialized in anything like accounting, sales or administration. I made a bit of experience in almost every department but it's not good enough to work on a certain place.

I considered, that continuing education could always be very good for me. Sadly, I'm unable to afford it and no other person is willing to pay it for me. Besides, I still need the experice to be qualified for a job, so it's not an option for me.

I also tried working in a enterprise, which doesn't exist in real life (f.e. Bears Trading AG). But sadly, it didn't help me either, because some companies do not consider it as experience. Furthermore, you get less time to research, because you still have the duties within a company.

I'm also actively looking for an internship, because it is most likely to get a postive reaction. But my hopes have almost been demolished. I have sent my application to one of the biggest personnel offices in Switzerland. Unlike most of my applications, I have recieved a feedback, within four minutes. 

They basically told me, that my appreniceship is bought and no one would ever pick you with your low BEC (Business English Certificate B1). He also said, I should regret, picking this apprenticeship because it's overflooded with way better people than me...

So after sending countless applications, my only conclusion should be, that I will never find something and I could be homeless after a few months?....

Well, it is kinda an unrealistic scenario and possibly the worst one too. I mean, you KNOW something is wrong, when you couldn't find a fulltime job after such a long time, right?

Is there anyone who has made the same experience? What should I do right now?..."

I think I get it from my parents who are both self-described as extremely ""type A.""  Possibly they passed down their anxieties to me and created a person who is ""type A+."" ;)

But in all seriousness, it has really impeded my ability to well with schoolwork, internships, workplace activities, and personal relationships. Recently, I have been dropped from my undergraduate thesis project in the Sociology department here at college because of my inability to get through a pre-requisite with a B or higher.  That was a rather large blow to my pride, to say the least, and has really started my re-evaluation of my anxiety and if it is ""under control.""

I would say that my anxiety manifests itself throughout my day/night in a variety of ways.  I am a smoker again (quit for 3 months, have smoked for 4 years in the past), I chew the inside of my mouth, I pick at my face/nails/scalp/belly button, I pace my room, stay up until 5 or 6 in the morning and wake up at 8, have racing negative thoughts constantly, and have trouble staying on task for a variety of times.  I don't really know what's going on in my head and so usually I ignore it.

In the past, I have been bullied for being ""weird"" among other things, and so I become fearful of being public with the issues that are hurting me. I haven't sought professional help in years because of this and the fact that I cannot afford it at the moment (full time student and also work 30 hours a week).  I don't want to be labeled as somebody with a ""disorder"" even though I probably have a whole body full of them.

To deal with my anxiety, I have tried yoga, meditation, vegetarianism, veganism, exercise, deep breathing, becoming a part of new clubs, taking on new job responsibilities, changing my career path.  Nothing has seemed to work and I don't really know where to turn.

What is a good next step and what is going on with me? I feel pathetic turning towards reddit, but I suppose it is also comforting nobody knows me here and so there is minimal judgement.

No one has died, I haven't been abused, I'm not homeless, I have a loving family, etc. I just feel like my life is unfulfilling. When people I graduated with in high school are getting to do all these fabulous things that I just can't afford, I get upset about it.

It's three weeks in and I just don't want to go out of my room, even if I'm wide awake and ready to go. All I want to do is lay in bed and daydream, because it is so much more fulfilling than the real world.

I feel so stupid. I don't have any reason to be so gloomy and hate life so much. I hate my life because it's not fulfilling, while people out there have legitimate reasons to hate their lives and to be upset over something that actually matters.


I was diagnosed with depression when I was 12, medicated for two weeks before I went crazy, haven't seen a psychologist since then and I question that diagnosis because I was 12.  Self-help is all I can get because I am too poor for health insurance or a psychologist."

I was wondering if you guys would be able to kind of point me in the right direction or give me some ideas. Here's an idea of what I do:

* By the time I'm hired, I'll be the DBA for 5-10 servers. My duties will include weekly maintenance, backup management, and DR. I'm tacking on optimization simply because I like when shit runs smoothly.
* I'll be a CRM application administrator performing such things as data and application security (user and entity permissions) and process configuration. I'll probably eventually start slightly helping with development, but that'll come a little later.
* I handle a few system administration duties such as user management (primarily within applications), inventory management, and server configuration.
* I handle monitoring for our applications and servers.
* I also handle change management for our team and our applications.
* Finally, I was told that there's the possibility to work security (one of my new passions) into my job. There are a few projects that they want me to finish before starting that, but assured me there was definitely future work I could delve into regarding security.

I feel like this is quite a few hats for one man to wear, but I greatly enjoy everything I do. The office is stress-free (for now) and I have the opportunity to work from home if needed. I find it hard to believe I'll ever be overworked (at least into the near future and at this job). I currently have no certificates, but plan to start pulling some in by the end of 2013 (not 100% sure what yet, thinking of starting with the MCSA). 

I'm sorry there's a lot here, but I'm kind of having trouble nailing down specifics. Again, I feel like a do quite a bit, but don't really know exactly what many administrators really do. My last internship was similar, with me being the man of many hats, which is why I don't quite understand the semantics.

From what I'm able to dig up, the only chance you have to transfer into Berkeley is when you are a rising junior, which is unfortunate. That said, I need to know what I should do for my sophomore year that will better my chances of acceptance.

I've applied to a ton of summer internships, and I'm looking at summer classes in the event that I don't get any of them (not much work out there for a freshman.) I have a variety of accomplishments from my high school career (valedictorian, excellent grades and ACT/SAT), but my college performance kind of slumped this first fall semester.

Thank you all for your insight! I can provide more details upon request."

I know that freshman-level internship questions are a dime a dozen here, and I've been through a solid chunk that have been asked and answered (including [LockeWatt's guide](/lockewatts.com/blog/2012/07/03/can-you-get-an-internship-as-a-freshman-a-guide/)). However, there's still an issue that I'm a bit unclear on.

I'm looking to apply to various internships for this upcoming summer freshman/sophomore summer. A lot of these posts say things like ""brush up on your data structs/algos"", but the issue is that I've had no formal training in anything in the area. I have plenty of personal projects that I've worked on (whether they're little calculators I've made, mobile apps for personal use/sale, or Arduino projects), but I've only been in school for about 12 weeks.

I take data structures next year, though I plan on seeing what courses I can move to this year. As far as I can tell, with no real knowledge in those subjects, answering common interview questions will be nigh impossible. I plan on researching the topics myself, but I can't see mastering it before these interviews come to fruition, especially considering we're in the midst of interview season for the summer.

As much as I would love to say ""I have the drive, and I've proven it in the past, but I've never been taught everything I need to know in terms of data structs, call me back after spring term"". Is my best course of action just studying up on it and hoping that I can learn enough to at least sound semi-competent for my first interview, wherever it may be?

I have done a 14 month co-op in Enterprise Architecture (somewhat related, did a little actual programming in it, but my real target is software development or web development)

I meet all the requirements to graduate with my Associates, just due to a hang up, it won't be official till May. In the meantime I'm taking a 2nd-level web course to keep academically relevant. Anyway...

I realize there are a LOT of positions that seem to insist on a 4-year degree regardless of experience, unless you can provide a wealth through some kind of portfolio or something, and with a 2-year degree, I'm wondering:

-is there any chance of getting any half decent employment until I get my 4-year, (I don't care too much the pay as long as it's somewhere around $15-20 an hour, I do have bills to pay - not looking for $50k+ and I know I can't get it)

-what would I expect? realize I'm targeting software/webdev so hopefully my only hope isn't some helpdesk job where I sit at a phone and fix someone's problems over a phone or something like that. Another co-op or internship that's more targeted on my degree goal would be great for experience points

what should I be looking for? What kinds of ""titles"" or job descriptions? It's hard to know what words to search for in a job board or something without getting 500 results that all say ""Senior XXXX"" or ""Junior XXXX (minimum 4-year degree + 2+ years experience)

I'd like to see if I can gain the 2+ years experience while still in school.

any suggestions?"

Representatives from the Comptroller of the Currency were here today recruiting for bank examiners. Any thoughts on that as a career move? The benefits would be what appears to be enjoyable work, networking opportunities abound, and it shouldn't be too difficult to enter the private sector with regulator experience. Negatives might be difficulty climbing the career ladder and travel (which I dont mind at all)

Some background, I go to an average University for CS, 3.7 GPA, previous internship experience at 3 different places. I do not have a top secret clearance, nor do I feel I could get one at this time.

My gut reaction is, this is a good offer, but recent glassdoor statistics are confusing me. It seems, entry level Software Engineering positions at some very large contractors are showing 3-5k higher averages for reports with &lt;1 yr experience than for people with 1-3 years experience. Have employers started fluffing data? Or has there been some recent surge in demand? Salary.com is telling me I should be expecting around 70k on average(50th percentile) for the defense industry with my experience(none), degree, and location.

My question is, should I apply elsewhere? This place is notorious for take or leave it offers, negotiation isn't an option(no one I know working there or who applied ever negotiated a better salary, I also tried already and they didn't budge). I did apply to one other (80~ employee) place with similar benefits, but upon hearing the offer told me right away they couldn't do better and to take the offer I had. I know large places(Lockheed, Northrop, ect) the benefits(especially pension matching) can't compare.

I'm really looking for feedback from other people in the area, comparing different markets is really difficult for new graduates. It's hard accepting what my research tells me is an ""average"" offer when I feel like I bring more than an ""average"" student. The company cited their research stating the offer was 70th percentile for the area."

I have a little brother who is around 16, I am just a few years older. Recently, I've caught him talking to a girl through Skype during the past few weeks. I wasn't really sure how to approach him about it, so I decided to probe a bit to see if he had any girlfriends or anything. He said he didn't. A few days ago, my mom and sister invited me to go out, but I decided to lurk on Reddit instead. My lights in my bedroom were turned off (so I imagine he thought I had left) because he closed the bedroom door. I didn't pay too much attention because I thought he was gonna rub one off, but then I heard a girl's voice. As I crept in closer I heard my brother say, ""Oh really? How did you think I'd look? Longer hair or shorter?"" I knocked on his door, and pretended to look for something in his room. His door was locked, and I heard him whisper, ""Oh fuck, gotta go"" When he opened the door he said, ""I have no idea how it got locked.""

Now today, I walked into his room (again, surprised him) and saw her. I am happy to say that she is not a 40 year old man. Thing is, when i asked him who she was, he said he met her at a summer internship, and she moved back whole other continent. I don't want to involve my strict conservative parents in this.

Reddit: as an older brother, how should I approach him about it? Should I call on his BS and tell him I know he didn't meet her here (where we live), or should I pretend I don't know he met her online?

Thanks for you help."

While pursuing that i did 1.5 years of help desk work at the same university.  I graduated with a 3.6 GPA and while I got good grades in programming classes, I never enjoyed programming that much.  I got into CS because I liked computers in general, and i was always fixing family and friends computers (software wise, not really hardware).  In the help desk position I had, besides phone support, we also did hands on support where we fixed students computers. (on a walk in bases, almost like geek squad.  However, software only, not hardware).  I also did an internship over the summer, but it wasn't really technical.  It was doing a lot of reports, and having weekly meetings with the boss and the developers to talk about various website features.  The most significant project I did for the internship was doing video editing for some videos we were producing.

I was never the one to program on my own time (tedious and boring).  I would say the most I learned was through the help desk job, because I ran in to a lot of different computer issues that I had to troubleshoot.

Halfway through the CS degree I realized it was catered more towards programming, but I decided to finish it because I felt that having a CS degree would be a good base, and allow me to go in many different directions.  The problem is at this point that I don't know which direction I want to go in.  

I always envisioned myself as some kind of computer administrator or in a desktop support role.  A friend of mine works as desktop support (software only) for a university and loves it.  This would be cool to do. However he doesn't live in the US.

Finding a job doesn't seem to be a problem as i have on average about 10 recruiters calling me weekly saying they have a position for me.  Most of these positions are help desk however.  One has been a QA testing role, and another one has been some kind of database role.  All have been within the 35k-45k range.

I have some siblings who are angry that I don't go for the 80-100k a year jobs.  They tell me that i should do this and that, but I know that money has never been a motivating factor for me.  I don't need that type of salary to live comfortably, and I try to never live my life for someone else.  Plus, I know that the higher the salary, the higher the stress.  I value my free time, and don't need a career where i'm going to be doing 60+ hours a week regularly. 40 hours M-F is fine with me.

At this point i'm not particularly picky, I just want a job that is computer related  (that is all I ever asked for).  I just don't know exactly which career path to eventually go towards.  My parents tell me to get any computer related job now just to have some more experience to put on my resume.  It's been a month after graduation and I feel like the longer I wait, the tougher it will be to break in.  Although I feel like i'm somewhat ahead of the curve as most kids graduate in May.

What advice would you give me?

I recently began a rotation in an Opioid substitution clinic (methadone) as part of my predoctoral internship, and I'm really struggling with the ethics of opioid maintenance.  It seems to me that with every other addiction, substance-abuse treatment looks to empower the patient, help them make more adaptive choices, and regain control over their addiction.  You detox (if necessary), and then put the patient into rehab, starting with more intensive and moving to less intensive over time, with the end-goal (generally) involving abstinence from substances.  With opioid maintenance, it seems like the opposite: we give them a dose of methadone that's high enough to take away their physiological ability to get high, and then may or may not predominantly leave them to their own devices.  We justify this by saying that they're more functional because they're taking a longer-acting opiate and therefore are not high, and they're healthier because they're not sharing needles, engaging in drug sales, etc.  Even the 2009 WHO Guidelines for Opioid Maintenance state that this can be the endgame: psychosocial rehabilitation is optional, and even if patients continue to take illegal opiates, keep them on methadone/buprenorphine.

However, this really rubs me the wrong way, because it feels like we're 1) disempowering individuals to overcome their addiction, and 2) taking their money for our methadone, rather than having them spend their money on the street.  In many ways I feel like opioid maintenance is a legal con; we're not using it to detox patients and help them control their addiction, we're just taking their money, and not necessarily moving them towards any other sort of reformation.

So I ask you fellow redditors: what are your thoughts about opioid maintenance?  Is there some angle here I'm not seeing?

My employer is asking me to put together some statistics about corporate relocation, and if I do a good job with this it could really do something great for my career. I need to find out how many people relocate for work annually, how many people graduate college each year, and how many people graduate college with at least 1 internship under their belts each year. Global stats are preferred, but national (USA) are helpful too. The main issue is that I need reliable, citable sources.

[Have you ever seen a case of Munchhausen by proxy?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800orn?context=5)|Yes. Not a single one. Many. Last year there was this specific single mom early in her 30s that would go into WebMD and find a random disease. Then, she'd come up with a story and ask for her kid to have all scans possible (the kid was 5 years old and i was not going to strafe run his body with radiation from a CT and several xrays). The mom wanted us to believe that the kid had Osteogenisis Imperfecta (Glass-Bone Disease) and came up with some weird stories. The kid had bad hand-shaped bruises all over his leg (the mom actually tried to break his femur, the strongest bone in the body), and we called social service. Never heard from the mom or the kid again.
[How do you deal with the heartbreaking reality that occurs when a child dies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8002qk?context=5)|The worst of seeing a kid dying on your supervision is that you're the one supposed to ask the parents to follow you to the social worker's office and there you have to say the same thing all the doctors say: ''We did everything we could. We followed the protocols but, unfortunatly, your son/daughter didn't survive. We are sorry for your loss and we will be here to help you in any way we can''. And then hear the relative scream: ""No, you didn't. If you did everything you could do, she'd be alive. I'm going to sue you/You are a monster/Is this because of my healthcare provider?"" This. THIS is a heartbreaker. Usually, they say that they are sorry, but this stays in your mind forever.
[Wow, that is harsh that most people resort immediately to pinning the cause of death on you. Have you ever been assaulted/harassed when parents were in this state?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800dpx?context=5)|Yes. A guy punched me in the face. But then he apologized.
[Wow seriously? Mind telling the full story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800ktl?context=5)|Here we go then. Bad car crash on a highway, two deceased on scene (other car), other two badly injured (wife and kid), one person almost unharmed (the father). Kid was taken to the hospital by helicopter already bradicardic (his heart frequence was very low) and we were trying to stabilize it while giving him blood/ringer fluid (he had several injuries and could potentially bleed out). Then he crashed on a V-fib (ventricular fribilation, when the heart is beating abnormally and not providing the body enough blood, in this case we have to shock) then we started CPR. The whole team was very focusing on saving that life and you could hear the father crying at the ER entrance. We shocked the kid about three times or so, and he finally came back on a stable sinus rhythm. At this time, the mother was already stabilized and on her way to orthopedics to get her broken leg operated, but several minutes after, the kid entered a state of shock doing a CT scan and crashed again. We did everything we could but then we realized he had several deadly injuries inside his body (injuries that we were about to discover on the CT scan) and he didn't make it. We made the procedure of telling the father and all, and then he punched me when i said his kid died. He said he'd sue me for malpractice and neglygency because we didn't discover that his kid had splenic rupture and liver injuries. The thing is that we were busy making his child breathe again before we did a scan, and the kid crashed again mid-scan, so we couldnt know since the abdomen was not that swollen, and then he apologized.
[Wow. That is heartbreaking. I can't imagine being on his or your end of that.  What was your reaction when he punched you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800w5s?context=5)|I had a very deep breath and walked out of the room.
[Opinion on circumcisions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8001v1?context=5)|Unnecessary.
[Have you ever seen pretty much clear evidence of child abuse and if so, how does that play out?  Like on medical TV shows where they secretly call the police and have them just show up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800b7n?context=5)|If we are sure that a child is being abused, we ask the parents to follow us into the hospital's social worker's office. They wait there (alone and under vigilance) until we have a Tuteraly Council agent to talk to the parents. If the abuse is really irrefutable, the child is usually taken from the parents and we call the police. What happens next is only for the cops and the parents to know.
[How frequently does this happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800xjs?context=5)|Not very often, because we work with poor, honest and humble people (the hospital is located on a poor neightborhood). But we are prepared to respond to this when it happens.
[What is your favourite part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c7zzp8n?context=5)|Walking out of the ER with good news for the parents.
[What is the worst case you have had to deal with on a young child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c7zzyr1?context=5)|So... The boy (13 years old) was riding his bike down a hill and he horribly fell, broke a leg and an arm, and somehow stuck his neck into the bycicles chain. Needless to say he suffered severe trauma and had cardiac arrest on scene. EMTs tried to bring him back but he arrived into the hospital on a very poor state and after 15 minutes or so of continued CPR we called him deceased.
[Thanks for doing this. It's one of the most interesting AMAs I've read through and I really respect your work. Also, your English is very good for it not being your first language!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c801051?context=5)|Thank you! I've been to English-speaking countries so i know how to speak English... Decently?
[Now that you are a doctor and have gone through all the hoops to get there, would you do it again? Do you feel you made the best career choice? I ask because I know it's not easy to be a doctor. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c7zzrh3?context=5)|Yes, i would. Being a doctor was my dream since i had like 4 years old. I never wanted to be a famous soccer player, an astronaut or something like that. I always wanted to be a medic. 85% of my toys when i was a kid were all about medicine. I had one birthday when i asked my mom for a cheapass stethoscope and she gave it to me.
[\[Edit: Also, what was your reaction the first time a child died under your care? I can't even imagine.\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800wla?context=5)|It depends. But we do have one or two deceased children per week that reach the hospital already dead or die in the ER, but like i said, i'm not always supervising the emergency room. There are other doctors.
[Wow. That is much more frequent than I would have thought. I edited my original question. When you have time, I would really appreciate you answering it as I am genuinely curious.  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8011u0?context=5)|My reaction was ''i killed this kid''. I was on my first days after residency and i was helping a more experienced doctor. This doctor was a very cool guy (he was an old man, like 60) and he told me that sometimes people die and we have to let go. I felt amazingly better.
[How are you able to balance your career and your outside life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8013bs?context=5)|I'm young so i live alone, i don't have a wife or kids (i'm 31) but i do have an amazing girlfriend who's always there for me. My job is the greatest thing in my life (after her, of course) and i love it. I usually don't talk much about my job with friends unless they are fellow doctors, and i live a normal life. It's not a big deal.
[What is your opinion on the current standards of pain management during painful tests such as VCUGs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800zau?context=5)|The pain management is fine, but the more psychologic appeal the test has (like VCUGs, no 5 year old is ready to have a tube inside his private parts), the more preocupied the parents get and the more painful it is for the child. Pain management on painful tests is deeply studied so the kid feels little to nothing, but sometimes they see what is going to happen and they think that they WILL feel pain and they end up crying and actually making the pain a big deal.
[I missed getting one of my kids a flu shot this year. Should I still try to get one for him or is this flu shot not effective?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c7zzykm?context=5)|Speak to your pediatrician, but i'd say yes. Better safe than sorry.
[About how many children do you attend to a day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8000ny?context=5)|There are three pediatricians everyday on the ER (Clinic), so i attend about 15 kids on a calm day and 30 when the ER's Clinic is filled with sick people (my shifts go 6AM-6PM). On the Emergency Room itself, about two to seven a day, if no big accidents happen. I do attend other emergency calls that don't involve kids.
[That shift seems harsh.. How do you keep a social life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8011ke?context=5)|My shift is not daily (but i'm going to work tomorrow and it's already midnight on my country so i should get some sleep, lol) and some doctors cover my place, but i do make friends inside the hospital as well. The interns, nurses and more experienced physicians have some cool stories.
[What do you, and other doctors at your hospital (if you know\) think of Obamacare?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800s7o?context=5)|I don't live in the United States so i don't know a thing about it. Mind giving me a heads-up?
[What made you decide to go into Pediatrics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8018xx?context=5)|I always loved children and i always had an interest on see how the job worked. I wanted to be a Neurosurgeon but then i dropped it and went to the pediatrics internship. I don't regret it.
[Have you ever seen Munchausen syndrome by proxy?  If so, what was the outcome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c80178l?context=5)|I did answered that, didn't i? I guess someone deleted it.
 |Yes, i did. TL;DR: Crazy mom, tried to break the kids femur because she wanted to make him look like he had Osteogenisis Imperfecta (glass bone disease), we called social service and the kid had to go onto psychiatric care and had tons of bruises all over her body due to the mom attempting to break a bone and make us believe that the kid had the disease. Kid had no other symptoms, muscular tone was k, and i never heard from the mom again.
[Will you prescribe me medical marijuana?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800fyh?context=5)|No.
[Has there ever been an occurrence so sad that you actually started crying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c803moq?context=5)|No. If you're a doctor you don't have any time to cry over an occurrence. But i know some stories about the EMTs (they are the ones who see what happened), when they arrive at the scene and the kid has just lost both the parents. It's sad.
[Do you participate in pediatric trauma treatment? or are there special pediatric trauma surgeons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c80545t?context=5)|Only when the patients are moved into the Emergency Room. After they exit the room for proper surgery treatment, there are other specifical ped surgeons.
[If you're asking for actual medical advice then you should probably call your own doctor.  The OP is probably legit, but common sense says to disregard anything someone tells you over the internet when it involves administering medication.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c808cjj?context=5)|Do not medicate your child unless a doctor says it's ok if you do (a doctor that actually takes a look at your kid and says what's better for him). There is nothing ok on giving medicine to someone sick without a doctor prescribing it.

179okv,5,2013-01-25,Am I (21f) wasting my time with m22?,psstsecret,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/179okv/am_i_21f_wasting_my_time_with_m22/,"The income wall of text comes with the exciting bonus of a crapton of parentheses. I apologize in advance.

My SO (we’ll call him M) and I met this summer at a bonfire. I was about three months off of a year and a half long relationship wherein my partner and I lived together. I ended the relationship primarily due to a desire to be young and single and not tied down. In hindsight, my relationship with my ex was very stressful and suffered from other issues as well.

M and I started seeing one another (casually, no-expectations) almost immediately. We took things slowly at first, but eventually developed an intimate, albeit NSA relationship.

This continued for two months, but we decided to make things official and try our hand at long distance when I headed back to school again this Fall (I’m only an hour away, but there are complicating details). The chemistry between us is insane, the sex is incredible and I had a feeling that the relationship was at least worth a shot. We’ve now been officially a couple for five months, but since the beginning, there have been.. issues.

When we were still casual, he was often distant or disinclined to make plans. I had to chase after him. I attributed this to his being more emotionally involved in the relationship at that point in time than I was (which was true), and assumed it would change once we’d gone official (it hasn’t). He has a general trend of not acting in a way that proves he cares about me (though I know without a doubt that he does). He has said, and I understand, that he’s much more physically than verbally affectionate, but with only seeing one another a few times a month, it gets emotionally trying. As a side note, this is only his second relationship and both of our first times being a partner in a long distance arrangement. I understand that part of this is just ironing out “remembering how to be a good partner”.

Our communication has also been thus far kind of dismal. He tends to get passive aggressive, defensive and (I believe, unintentionally) manipulative when I bring up a problem, leading us to discuss (argue about) his communication style rather than the actual issue at hand. We recently had a long talk about this (mostly me talking, him listening), and I think we both agreed to compromise and meet in the middle regarding communication. No situation has come up since to test this agreement.

On the few occasions thus far that I’ve brought up problems and we’ve been able to discuss them, he’s made an effort to adjust accordingly.

These are just some of the current issues with the relationship. It’s all stuff that I’m totally willing to talk to him about and work around in order to make us work as a couple. In light of the “bigger picture”, though, I’m wondering if it’s even worth our time to try.

I am a full time college student, varsity athlete and work the maximum amount of time allowed by my on-campus employer. My parents pay for my tuition, but I cover all my day-to-day living expenses. I’m on track, at the moment, to graduate a semester early after a completing an exciting internship in my field of study. I do not have a car (complicating detail), but plan on saving my internship wages to buy one.

My SO is a high school graduate (barely), and employed part time (30ish hours a week) at a retail behemoth. He pays his own rent and lives in an apartment with his brother and ex-stepfather. He does not have his driver’s license (further complicating the LDR), and owes $900 to a collections agency from a community college he chickened out before attending. He is, essentially, a textbook loser.

But he’s also a great guy. He’s funny and sexy and sweet and charming and confident and a hundred other great things. But I’ve done the whole “boys going nowhere” thing before, and it’s just a bad situation for both parties. He has such potential, but seems totally apathetic to moving forward with his life. Part of this stems from him mom being a kinda shit parent when he was growing up, but at some point, you’ve got to rise above whatever crappy hand you’ve been dealt. He doesn’t have a plan for his life, nor any real idea of how to function as an adult. I may not have a specific plan for me, either, but I know I’m going places, and I want him with me as an equal, contributing partner, not a tag-along.

Reddit, what do I do? Facing all these small problems in our relationship, in light of the bigger picture, makes me super depressed about our future potential. But I love this man, and the thought of breaking up with him is so upsetting. I could easily see us together long term, but sometimes, the situation now seems hopeless that it might be better to cut our losses before we’re both even more invested.

Sorry if this is too much of a jumble, I haven't had an opportunity to get all my thoughts out on this yet. I'm happy to clarify anything y'all have questions about.

**tl;dr 21f with a 22m for 5 months. Great potential and awesome chemistry, but a ton of extenuating circumstances, both small (communication issues, relationship expectations), and large (totally different places in our lives). Is it worth trying, or should I accept that there are too many issues and end things now, before we’re both more invested?** "

My comment about social anxiety that shakedown submitted to bestof made the front page of reddit, wtf?! If you sent me a message or email and haven't heard back, you're not alone. School started this week and I haven't had time to do much with the blog/responding to people at all. I'll try to do more this weekend. 

Anyway, I just wanted to write a reminder that today is technically the last day to send me a message about the online improvement group. I'm going to extend that until Sunday evening since I likely won't be able to do anything for the group until then anyway. I've had a few responses, but the geographic locations of those interested might make it hard to run a weekly group because of the time differences. I'll definitely do 1-on-1 chats with interested participants at this point, and if it works out that we can all come together online as a group, even a few times, then great. If not, I'm happy to link people together who are in the same time zones and maybe we can have mini-groups.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, here is a repost from the AMA: 

I like this forum quite a bit because I find that most of the people who post here are generally not whiners who blame everyone else for their problems. They genuinely want to make positive changes in their lives, but often don't know how. Not knowing ""how"" is okay - there are many things one can do in order to learn. It's the attitude that is important to start off with.

My favorite types of people to work with when I do therapy and mentoring are the people who have self-awareness. They understand the impact of their own decisions, often recognize why these decisions are not positively influencing their lives, but don't know how to enact change. Make sense? I can help you if you want to help yourself.

The types of people I don't enjoy working with are the people who complain a lot about their lives, have excuses for everything, and don't recognize or take any responsibility for their own actions.
I've been thinking in the last few days how else I can try to support the people who read this forum. I read in another post that some people are interested in doing a men's group. I have an idea that may or may not work, but if people are interested, I'd be willing to explore it. I'd like to find 4-5 guys on this forum who would be interested in being part of a group. I would help to lead/facilitate this group to begin with (running groups is something I do at work, so I do have some experience with it). 

It would involve weekly group meetings, at a set time and day, in an online chat. I would also have one-on-one online chats with each of the members to help them identify their problems and help them set goals. After that, I can act as a ""personal trainer"" of sorts - someone who will check in and see how the goals are going, push them when they're feeling poorly about meeting goals, offer encouragement, etc.
In order for this to work, the members really need to be the self-aware, non-complainer types I mention above. I would be tailoring exercises for each person, and checking in to see if they are doing these exercises. E.g. For someone who has social anxiety and really doesn't like to leave the house, I might tell them to walk around the block once as a starting goal. Then we would check in about that, see how they felt, and set bigger goals for them to accomplish if that worked out. That's just an example, and it will be different for each person in the group. Once a week, you will all come together online, talk about what's been happening, and support each other.

If anyone is interested in this, send me a message on reddit or email me at datingwtf@gmail.com by Friday, Jan 25th with a paragraph describing yourself with the subject line ""Improvement Group"". I am interested in 3 things: 1) A brief history of issues you have, 2) Why you would benefit from being in this group, and 3) Anything you feel like telling me about your age, occupation, level of education, interests like favorite movies, music, etc. If you have an OKCupid profile, you could link me to that if you'd prefer. The purpose of 3) is to help match people. A group is not going to work out well if you have nothing in common. Most importantly, in your message, be honest and open. I will be able to tell if you're just telling me things you think I want to hear. [Edit: It is actually pretty important for me to know your age and location, so please do include that.]

If people are interested, and we form a group, I'd check in with the group members to see if they'd be willing to share their progress on this forum with everyone else.

PS. Just to clarify, I am not a therapist (just an intern) and if you need serious help, or have suicidal thoughts, please see a licensed therapist and/or call a suicide hotline. Info can be found here: http://www.suicidehotlines.com/"

179g60,0,2013-01-25,LinkedIn: Why you should sign up! « URBANDECKCHAIR,natssadler,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/179g60/linkedin_why_you_should_sign_up_urbandeckchair/,"Recently, on my way to Lake Windermere for a conference (see my “the importance of being online” post) I met other interns like myself. We all varied in age from as young as 19 (me!) to 26 and all held a range of different positions in our current organisations.

After I had left the conference, we had been given a sheet with names of who attended and I was shocked at how incredibly difficult to find some, not all I add, of the interns on a professional network I.e on LinkedIn!

I one, think more and more companies should follow the trend of including tweet addresses, find me on such and such on delegate lists and name tags as social media is a great way to connect.

Anyway, my point being GET ON LINKEDIN!

I say this to many of my friends some who work in an admin post, some work in sports and some in accounts, eventhough we may be young… That is no reason why we shouldn’t be on LinkedIn.

I personally find it a massive confidence booster, having to speak to new people and also have the guts to connect with people, write a summary that does sell yourself! LinkedIn can offer a wide range of opportunities to you locally and much further afield, through job listings, following your favourite company or public figure and by introducing yourself and your skills to the big leagues in these organisations! Who knows what you could get from it!

The network is a huge information pool of resources, facts, statistics and opinions. By joining groups which are dedicated to set topics you can interact with like minded individuals and also learn new things with others.

I think it is a great tool “pre-interview” to “prep” yourself on your key skills and interests and also by using it as a basis for your cv. I love seeing the 100% all star profile rating on my page and I feel confident if someone looked at it they would get a good idea of me professionally. You can draw from recommendations and endorsements potential references and also skills and expertise you might not of thought of to add to your cv.

LinkedIn is an online community just like Facebook and Twitter with a professional focus and I don’t think age should play any factor in holding you back from joining!"
179ebd,1,2013-01-25,[Request] (Serious) Can anyone help design a logo for my website? www.whynotemploy.me?,whynotemployme,picrequests,https://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests/comments/179ebd/request_serious_can_anyone_help_design_a_logo_for/,"Hi, I made a website a few years ago (whynotemploy.me) and I ended up getting a 12 month internship in the US. I'm using it as my final year project for my university, but I'm hoping to carry it on after I've finished university, so other people can benefit from it the same way I did. 

It's basically a place when you can enter your personal details, qualifications, work experience, and then upload examples of your work, list your skills, and enter your contact info. You can then link to your www.whnotemploy.me account on your paper cv/resume. (Potential) employers can see all your information + examples of your work, and are able to email you straight from your profile page. 

The plan is for it to become ""www.whynotemploy.me/**yourname** and then eventually (depending on legality) users can buy/rent **company.**whynotemploy.me.

I have 0 design skills, and I've spent about 2 hours with a pencil in my hand trying to draw something that I like. Well, I've discovered I'm not original, and I definitely cannot draw. 

So, that brings me here. Can anyone think of a good logo for the domain? I'd prefer it to be wider than it is longer (to fit in with website design) but that's about it; I'm open to anything. You could either design it on pencil/paper, or make it in Photoshop, whatever you feel like doing is fine with me! 

I was thinking about having ""Why Not"" in smaller writing on top of ""Employ."" and then ""me"" with a start background or something like that.

I can't really afford to pay more than $30-40 / £20-30 (broke-ass student) OR (when/if) give you a subdomain of your choice (microsoft/google/tesco/etc.whynotemploy.me)

This is his first relationship and we're both very similar, but I think this causes us to bump heads. He's a bit of a hot-head, which is opposite from me, though. He will get mad over the slightest thing and I hate it, but it's his way of venting. I realize this because my way is to pent up all my frustration. He's also very negative. He puts everyone down and I think I'm starting to do the same because of it. But my biggest issue with him is that he has that sense of competition and how he needs to be better than me or on equal terms. I'm in college so I need an internship (we're the same year) and so does he, but if I got an internship before him then he would be upset with me until he got one because of his self-esteem issues.

Mr. bassticle

my address

some town in, MS #####-####
 
Dear Mr. bassticle:
 
Thank you for contacting me to share your support for the Second Amendment. It is good to hear from you, and I appreciate having the benefit of your views on this matter.
 
Let me reaffirm my unwavering support for the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The right to bear arms is a fundamental right that is assured to every law abiding citizen. As a lifetime member of the NRA, I have and will continue to fight for the right to bear arms while serving as your Representative in Congress, and I will oppose any so-called “assault weapons ban.”
 
Like you, I was shocked and saddened by the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, 2011, when twenty children and six adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our country mourned the loss of these innocent lives and rightfully asks why did this happen, and what can be done to prevent it from happening again.
 
Passing laws restricting the rights of gun owners may make some members of Congress feel accomplished, but history has shown us that gun bans are not effective in stopping crime. You can rest assured that I look forward to a debate on curbing violence and ensuring our children and families are safe, but I will not be supporting legislation that scores cheap political points at the expense of law abiding citizens.
 
Again, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with me on this important matter.  I hope that you will continue to keep me informed of the issues important to you and your family, as your input helps me to better serve you as your Representative in Congress. If you would like to stay informed of the latest issues coming out of Washington, you can visit www.Nunnelee.house.gov/email to sign up for my e-newsletter.
 
 
Sincerely,

Alan Nunnelee

Member of Congress

Good people of the Hague, I just received an acceptance letter from the International Criminal Court for a 6 month internship. I'm currently living in the U.S. - Philadelphia to be specific.

What type of rent should I expect to be giving in this situation? How expensive is it to live in the Hague? How expensive is travel to neighboring countries? 

I'm also trying to talk to people who have interned with the ICC to get a feel about it's culture and everyday operations. Thanks in advance.

We are together for almost 2 years now. Everything was great at the beginning. We met at a party, she was still in relationship back then. We were talking for about 3 months, she wanted to dump him because we were getting close and he didn't spend nearly any time  with her. She tried but ""couldn't do that to him"", then he dumped her because she didn't have a job and did nothing with it. I was so happy when we started dating. First year was great and we were happy just being together, spending time with each other and not worrying about anything. But then we started to fail. Last summer I got part time job (30h/week) and managed to finish last year of technical university (full-time studies). But still i managed to find whole Saturday to spend time with her and was seeing here nearly every day after classes/work. We talked about living together after I graduate but to do this she has to get a job. She hasn't found one for the whole time we are together (2 years). After she finished high school (5 year ago) she got an internship but when it ended she didn't get job there. She told me that because of it, the fact that her parents always took her whole salary and that she didn't get to the university she wanted, she got depressed and stopped searching for a job and stopped thinking about education. She has rough situation at home - her parent yell at her every day for various reasons ( ""get a job"", ""pay us or we will kick you out"", ""you can't do what you want for breakfast/dinner"" ) On top of that she got evicted from her home just after we start being together (her parents don't work, just doing some temporary assignments or babysit some kids) and now she live in small , 1-room flat. I love her and I want to help her get normal happy life. I tried to understand her , not pressure her or anything.
 

We talked a lot about it and she started searching again. This summer (when i started my job) she got in hospital and had a surgery. I was with her every day (1 hour train ride) after work just so she won't be alone ( her parents didn't visit her often). It was fine with me that she stopped searching for a job after hospital for 2 months (she fully recovered after). But then she didn't bother to start again. 
 

We argued a few times. I told her how bad I feel about it and that she has to do something. So she started again, and with me seeing her every day + all Saturday i thought it's going to be fine. But about 2 months ago she got another problem with her health. She doesn't work so I cover her medications and visits with doctor and don't have problem with it. In a 2 week time she will get a treatment (nothing life-threatening) and will be healthy again. She told me that she feels bad that I give her so much money for it but i told her that I don't have any expenses right now so it's ok and I repeated again (i tell her this very often) that I want to take care of her and want her to be well.
 

Yesterday she told me that she want to stop searching for a job for some time again because of this treatment. I got very angry because she always talks about getting some flat to live together, that she's preparing cook book for ""our home"" and that ""our home"" is very important purpose for her too. But how can living together without taking break from searching for a job be done? I don't understand it completely. 
She always want to hug, have calmness and spend more time with me. We talked many times that to have it all, we need to live together and to achieve it we both need a job. 
  

Now I don't know if she will do something about job or not (we talked that with the job change I could afford living with her even if she won't help with payments - but I told her that it won't happen and that she has to do what she can to help even if she contribute 10% of total payments).I understand her fears and trying to make her feel better whenever she has really bad moment with crying (and it's like 1 time/day mostly) but 2 years of being for her and she started searching for a job after 1 year and didn't do more than searching trough Internet with pauses ( 2 times she went to mall to hand out her cv in shops after I nearly begged her to do it and I had to go with her). I tried talking about courses, going to some job agency where they could help  I'm quite devastated by her yesterday's statement and don't know what to do or how to talk to her about it. 
 

Today we started writing and she *don't want to talk about work for now*. The thing is, she told me this in the past a few times already ( just realized it). There is a job as kitchen help in my city (2 minute walk from her home) and she is not interested.  I'm very confused as she told me that one time she is more motivated , another she is less.

So, I've been combing online for these and haven't got a good idea of how it should be formatted and what's relevant.

A little background: 

* I'm in my fifth year as a PhD student in the social sciences (have most of the dissertation data analysis done, written 2/5 chapters), looking for non-teaching work, in particular either institutional research or other education intervention/consulting.

* I've worked as a GSR on a couple different projects under 3 people during the last couple summers. Most of this work has been of the exploratory nature- go through these big data sets and work up a codebook and syntax, put out memos on what's interesting, and put together some models, draft up some pieces (intro, lit review, etc) for a paper.

* Out of these projects, one made it to conference and publication (I'm a co-author), and the others ended up not working out the way the PIs hypothesized so were either scrapped or folded into a different paper they are working on and have gone to conference that way. Also, for two of these PIs, I was devoting time to two or three different data sets at a time on different research questions.

How do I write these up? I've got headings with the dept. and PI's name (John Smith, PhD? Assistant Professor?) and the basic research topic. Beyond that, I'm not sure.

Here's the deal.  I have 3.3 cumulative gpa currently in second semester of my junior year as a molecular biology and biochemistry major.  I've TA'd gen chem for a semester, have 3 years of undergrad research experience, with one poster and 2 potential papers (there supposed to be submitted for publishing in march if all goes as planned).  I had an excess of AP credit, which afforded me the opportunity to take graduate classes as an undergrad.  I did in internship at a pharmacy last summer, but discovered pharmacy wasn't particularly my calling.

Hello, 

I'm currently studying to take the MCAT on april 4th. 
I'm a senior, graduation in may.

**current GPA:**

cGPA: 3.64
sGPA: 3.485

My ECs aren't stellar by any means. 

**Performance choir** - 9 years

Member of a few **clubs** on campus (chem club, bio club, etc.)

**Research Intern** - San Diego Zoo (paid - 400 hours, with powerpoint presentation of findings)

**Clinical Quality Intern** - Safe Surgery Auditing (paid - 400 hours - with presentation of findings to lead hospital staff)

Starting to participate in a **homeless ministry**.

After graduation I'm hoping to get a **Scribe position** I've applied and been called back for an interview for at a local hospital at home. 

**I haven't done any clinical volunteering. One question i have is do you think the paid internship at a hospital along with my coming scribe job would be sufficient?**

I'm already taking at least a year off if I apply this cycle, but I'm wondering if my lack of volunteer experience and community outreach (which i'm working on this semester) would seriously affect my chances. 

My top school is **University of Minnesota** (my state school, while i'm at undergrad in california). 

**Options:**

* If i do well on MCAT - apply anyway, if i don't get in work on community outreach portion of my app for next cycle.

* If i do poorly on my MCAT, don't apply - work on both bettering my MCAT score and improving my community outreach portion of my app.

* Regardless of MCAT score, don't apply and focus on improving my application.

2. Try to find a job not related to my field (maybe even part-time), or

3. Look for internships and hope that I can get a job through the company once I graduate with my degree?

I will be graduating this semester with a bachelors in computer science from a state university (~3.86 GPA). My only experience...

* An android app (somewhat trivial-ish, ~350 users, ~4.5/5 rating)
* A summer research project I did at a larger university pertaining to software defined networking on Android. Relatively substantial, coding intensive, and the whitepaper was accepted to a conference.
* Worked as a TA for a semester
* One undergrad project with neural networks and image recognition, which was not entirely successful. However, the vast majority of it was functional (including the neural net for basic data), we just couldn't get it to recognize the images in the specific context.
* Another about watermarking biometric images (implementation of someone else's research). 

**No actual company experience** (ignoring ~6 years of low wage work in the service industry)

Hoping to go into software development, preferably related to science (health, technology, anything that isn't banking or video games basically). I turned down an offer for grad school (well, haven't taken them up on it, anyway) because I was overly eager to start working. I may go back one day, but I'm desperate to find substantive employment in the short term.

So, what do? Every time I find an internship at a major software company, they seem to exclude recent graduates. Every entry level job requires experience. Do I even have a shot at any major companies without actual experience? And as much as I dislike it, I am not above abandoning software development for IT. However, they are going to care even less about the experience I have, so maybe that's even less likely.

I guess my question is, how screwed am I? And where should I be looking? What should I be emphasizing to compensate?"

I'm currently a CCNA II student at my local vocational center studying Routing and routing protocols. Last year I took Cisco's IT Essentials course and went to Illinois' Skills USA Competition for Computer Maintenance Technology. I placed 16th out of 44 contestants.

I recently got hired on as a ""Network Intern"" at my high school and I work under the Director of Technology there with another intern. My internship, or job as I like to call if, consists of acting as a help desk technician throughout the school near the end of the day, shipping and receiving equipment, inventory, deploying hardware and software, performing minor software and hardware fixes, etc. The list goes on, trust me. I'm sure that most of us have been there or will be. I had an internship at a local hospital over the summer that consisted of most of the same criteria, just heavily supervised, for obvious reasons.

My question for you all is... What's next? 

I'll be attending a junior college in a neighboring town next year after I graduate HS this year. I'll be continuing the internship next year, and hopefully the year after that while still attending JuCo.

I need some advice on what exactly is prime real estate for IT jobs right now. I see most acronyms on here and couldn't tell you what the hell they mean. I'm wanting a job in a small to medium sized company.. big enough to have some work to do, small enough to know everyone and their children's names.

Is it best to start from an entry level position and gain knowledge as you go in the company? Or is it best to come in straight out of the gate as an expert in a certain entity?

I'm really interested to hear some feedback, and if you're willing, a small story on how you got where you are.

Then I wanted to be a pilot, until I learned that pilots have to sit in a chair for hours and can't listen to music or really do anything except stare at the ground.  They only fly during landing and take-off for crying out loud!  I couldn't handle that!

Then I wanted to be a teacher, but that too had its drawbacks.  Then I wanted to be this, then that, then this, then that... It just kept going on and on.  Finally the other day I had a mini epiphany and realized, what better job for a person with ADHD than an ADHD psychologist/psychiatrist?

I did some research and it keeps seeming more and more like the job for me.  I love helping people, I know what ADHD feels like, and I have some ideas:

 * Outdoor therapy sessions: I have debated doing therapy myself before, but just the idea of sitting in a leather chair in an office and staring at the ceiling for like an hour just doesn't sit well.  I would be nervous for one, and just sitting there I think my hyperactivity and inattentiveness would get the best of me.  And so I have been thinking and I realized that if the sessions were outside (like done on a hike or something) I would be much more at easy and I wouldn't be so restless and distracted either.  That is what I wold do with my patients.

 * For younger kids keeping all ADHD therapy sessions very interactive.

 * I have more already formulating in my head.

My question is this:  What do I need to do?  I'm starting out as a high school student so this gives me a clean slate.  

* What kind of degree do you need to be an ADHD psychiatrist/specialist?

* Can you do any interning for it?

* What are some good colleges for ADHD specialiation? (preferably under 40-50 grand a year)

* ADHD psychiatrists/specialists out there: Do you like your job?  Would you recommend it to an ADHD kid who loves helping people and is (something) of an ADHD enthusiast?

1788o6,2,2013-01-24,I was an overworked unpaid intern,arachnivore,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1788o6/i_was_an_overworked_unpaid_intern/,"Short version: I was an unpaid intern at a lab. My boss had me work up to 100 hours a week on critical software, then fired me. Almost a year has passed. What should I do?

Long version:
I worked as an unpaid intern writing code for a lab at a university for four months last year (Nov. 2011 - Feb. 2012). There was a student in charge of the lab who was attempting to spin it off as a start-up company.

For the first month, I worked about 24 hours a week and held a part-time job. Then in December, my boss had the team go on a programming ""retreat"" out at his parents boat-house which was a week straight of 14-16 hour days of non-stop programming. My boss had already mentioned that he could start paying me when he got funding (as early as March), but during the retreat he mentioned that he was working to get funding through the university sooner.

By the end of December I had received a job offer for a tech support company, but my boss told me that if I declined that job offer, he would start paying me out of pocket (""$900/month"") until he could pay me a full salary. I agreed to decline the job offer because I thought the work I was doing at the lab was a much more compelling.

When January started, my boss had just completed the paperwork for his company and my workload quickly became overwhelming. I was working 80 hours a week until the last week of January when I pulled a 100 hour week. I was building and testing a key component of our product and we had to demonstrate our work by the end of the month. I was paid $600 for that month.

In the first two and a half weeks of February, I was assigned a research task. I was to write code and test a new motion segmentation technique. When I finished my work on that, I was assigned a new feature to code. In the last week of February I was told that I was going to be classified as a ""visiting scholar"" so that I could be paid by the University (I was not enrolled at the university at this time). That never happened though, because my boss fired me for ""inadequate performance"". I worked about 60 hours a week in February. I was paid $800. The research I conducted was published, but I got no recognition for my work.

I was not in a good financial situation when I started the job and I was pretty much financially ruined afterward. I had to take a crappy job immediately after being fired to keep my head above water. Now I've recovered enough to start thinking about taking legal action.

I know Texas is a right to work state, but I'm pretty sure the laws regulating unpaid interns are Federal and that my employer violated them. Based on my (novice) interpretation of the law, my previous employer owes me ~$30,000. I'm not very keen on dragging the university into a legal battle, just my boss. What should I do?"

So here's my sob story - transferred twice before ending up at UB (transferred for a girl, didn't work out, I'm a dumbass). I had a great GPA at my previous two schools (Syracuse University and Hofstra University) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering double major. 

Grades dropped as trouble with the girl started, but I managed to get an internship at a local manufacturer where I still work. 

While I was interning there, I lost my license. I couldn't take the bus from work to school and back to work as was needed, and with no job I'd be SOL. My work offered my a full time position and I took it. I've been working there 3.5 years now, 2.5 years since I stopped going to UB.

I want to go back, and work is really encouraging me to finish up my degree. I've got 96 credit hours complete, so I'm almost there. I've tried talking to the advisors but they're not much help. I'd have to re-apply to the department and they haven't been much help in that regard, I'm guessing because my GPA was pretty poor while at UB. 

I was hoping to talk to someone else in the school that might be more help; I'm sure the school would like to improve their graduation rate, and the department would like to have another alumni. I already have the job; I work with other engineers on the same level that have their bachelors and masters. I just need the piece of paper! It's starting to hold back my career.

I've built and managed a web hosting company, web sites, and built pc's but I haven't really had any networking experience aside from my home network. As of right now my goal will be to graduate with a bachelors in network administration. 

The main reasons I want to get my certification are 1)I know it will help me in the future 2) To find a job while i'm in school. Even an internship would be okay with me.

I was wondering if anyone could give some feedback or advice on the state of my career, based on my background. Mainly, I've gotten stuck in a position that's more system administration than programming. I have one phone interview lined up, and HR recruiters have contacted me over LinkedIn, but in general, technical recruiters at career fairs have been ambivalent and sometimes confused about my background.

_Edit:_ The gist of it is that I spent seven years not really thinking about the future or doing anything on the side, and now I find myself kind of stuck. I'm making less than entry-level CS pay, and I'm doing system administration when I would rather get away from working with hardware. My resume looks impressive, but I have little real software engineering background, and I haven't developed my sysadmin skills beyond hacking around on the Linux command line and swapping out hard drives. 

My background:

* BS in computer science from a top Institute of Technology about 10 years ago, good GPA. Did a couple of projects.
* A summer internship in a software engineering startup.
* Two years working on a small business making a tool to help people building web pages. Didn't really get anywhere.
* Programming and IT for the next 7 years at my current job. I maintain legacy software in C and have designed new software in C++ and developed some PHP web pages. I also administrate about 10 Linux servers. I frequently write small programs in Perl or shell scripts to help administration, and I also frequently do maintenance on the legacy programs. However, most of my time is administration -- configuring software and making sure it runs, managing user accounts, and troubleshooting problems. Most of my software involves getting things out of a relational database or putting them back in. 
* Started an online Masters program. Did well in the classes I took but didn't continue the program. Was lead dev on a group project.
* Only started doing side projects recently. Have gotten familiar with Python, which I occasionally use at work as well, and Google AppEngine. I've done some work with Ruby on Rails, but not enough to actually build anything from scratch with it unless I get much more practice.
* Took several free online classes. That's where I got my RoR experience. Also learned MongoDB and have some familiarity with AI and machine learning."

Sorry for block of text:

I know it’s only been 3 weeks since I told you all that I broke up with my boyfriend. I’m just excited to tell you that I’m doing very well. I’ve decided that I should give you a little more information since I was very short with you in my post. More information may explain why I’m doing better than I (and most people) thought I would do. 

My (ex)boyfriend first punched me after 8 months, since then it developed to every 2 months or so. It wasn’t always punching. It was shoving, head-butting, and hitting. I forgave it since I convinced myself it was my fault. My (ex)boyfriend lived with me for over a year (over half of our relationship). During this time, he did not have a car (so I drove him everywhere), did not pay for a single utility, and didn’t pay rent. I took care of his every need, and all I asked him to do was get some kind of job. This is where most of our issues developed. He graduated with a great degree but didn’t bother getting a job with it, so I slowly became very irritated and resentful toward him. I sat down multiple times and told him that I didn’t think we were going to work out, and that I couldn’t do it anymore, but told myself that all of our issues, all of the anger, and all of the problems would just disappear when he got a job. 

Anyway, the first two days were very hard and I broke no contact both days. I texted him my sincerest apologizes and told him how much I wanted him back (I’m sorry 2x…). He didn’t once apologize for attacking me and told me that everything was my fault. The next day I asked him to skype with me, and he told me that he could spare me “a couple minutes”. I asked him if we were getting back together sometime, and he told me that we might in the future. I got upset and told him that if he tells me that, then I’ll sit around and wait for him. I asked him to tell me that we will not get back together, that he doesn’t want to hear or see me anymore, and such. He didn’t sound bothered by saying that to me at all while I cried on the other line. 
 
So my roommate and her boyfriend took me out to a bar so we could have some fun. She invited a friend of hers, who I ended up getting with while I was trashed. Even though it was clearly a one night stand, he still cuddled me, and kissed me while we just laid there in the morning. You might think that this was a horrible idea, but I think it was the best thing that could have happened. I had an epiphany that my (ex)boyfriend isn’t the ONLY person who can ever make me feel cared about or special. There are actually other guys out there. My (ex)boyfriend contacted me a couple days ago in possibly the rudest way possible. He asked me for a job where I intern. When I didn’t respond, he then proclaimed that if I didn’t respond, that he would never want to talk to me again. – keep in mind he didn’t once apologize for attacking me, but still finds it ok to ask me for a job. I think it finally sank in that my ex isn’t the great guy that I had convinced myself that he was. 

I’m moving on, and I’m moving on fast. I don’t need to be hung up on some guy who physically hurts me. I need to be single, find myself again, and be happy with myself. In the meantime, I’ll just enjoy meeting new guys and seeing where the future brings me. I’m going to focus on all the things I want to do and experience, not how to make my boyfriend the happiest.

2X, you have been such a great help, and such a great community. It’s funny, a couple of you told me I would feel relieved, and I do, - I feel so happy. Thank you for all your support.

Hopefully he reads it and I don't come off as a crazy person.

The text:

***


As a life long Democratic voter and a long time viewer of the Daily Show, I was very disappointed by Jon Stewart's firearms segments, and hope that the rest of this letter is read by him, or at least dictated by an intern to him:

First, while I am aware that the Daily Show is a comedy show and repeatedly states that it isn't to be taken as a real news show, having two entire episodes dedicated to firearms/2A/gun control shows that you are shedding his normal position of sideline commentary in favor of a advocacy. He must be aware that many young people in this country trust him as a news source more than they trust any other television news source. Those one-sided advocacy segments are an abuse of that trust.

To fall back on the claim that The Daily Show ""isn't real news and shouldn't be taken as such"" as a defense at this point is literally the same snake-in-the-grass tactic utilized by the likes of Bill O'Reilly and Fox'N'Friends. 

With my preamble out of the way, on to my actual problems with your treatment of firearms on the show. First, you did start out some segments by correctly noting that the NRA is not representative of all gun owners in America as a homogenous group. However the entirety of the segments then went on to slam the NRA and take any position it held (good or bad) and use the connection of some good ideas to the NRA as a way to smear those ideas. Your push for gun control ideas is relying on attacks against a segment of the gun owning population that is easy satire pickings that your target audience would instantly laugh at without looking at the ideas. It was much like doing a segment on the Westboro Batist Church and using them to support banning free speech. 

Your use of props and characterization of gun owners as essentially rednecks was, frankly, very insulting. You were perpetuating a stereotype that I think, many anti-gun people wished was what all gun owners were like. I'm a California born son of an immigrant (see: My unpronounceable last name) and I've traveled the world and seen many peoples and ways of life. MY experiences of living in an expanded world have strengthened, not weakened my support of firearms rights.

Your prop M16 (I presume it was a rubber training rifle) an an example of an absurd gun was ridiculous. First, I am still amazed that we live in 2013 and people are falling for the absurd idea that fully automatic weapons are easily obtainable by civilians. Fully automatic weapons are already highly regulated and none of the currently proposed AWB type laws deal with automatic weapons. Aside from magazine capacity, the proposed AWB laws on the table ban weapons and weapon types based on cosmetic features that might increase ergonomics, but certainly wouldn't affect deadliness in a civilian shooting scenario. For example, the civilian legal mirco-UZI pistol is on the list of specifically banned weapons in Diane Feinstein's bill. The civilian legal micro-UZI is a semi-automatic copy (that can not be easily converted to full automatic without a dedicated machine shop) of the military firearm, and it fires the extremely common pistol caliber of 9x19mm. Stripped away of it's scary facade, it functions identically to the hundreds of legal 9mm handguns that would remain legal if the AWB were to pass. Many more examples exist in the form of the Hi-Point Carbine being banned or of the mini-14 tactical being banned. 

It's like the writers of the AWB looked at 'Call of Duty' and decided to ban everything in it specifically. 

If you think that it is a perfectly rational ban list at this point and after all the arguments made by firearms enthusiasts, then I must only presume it is because you think all guns are bad and must be banned. If that is indeed the case, then the gun control proponents should be brave enough to stand up and say that instead of chipping away at existing gun rights and calling every tiny bite they take out of legal gun ownership rights a ""compromise"". The word ""compromise"" implies that both sides gain something, when in fact it is always gun owners who stand to lose something.

On a related couple of notes, I'll just leave three final short thoughts:

One. New York state just passed a magazine capacity law reducing their legal state capacity from 10 bullets to 7 bullets. Does anyone really think that is going to reduce crime?

Two. Diane Feinstein (as quoted in a recent Bloomberg.com article) has stated that she intends to argue for a national AWB by using pictures of the dead Newtown children. I truly hope you think this is a disgusting tactic designed to elicit an emotional response and a shaming effect to garner votes. 

Three. When looked at logically, ""assault weapons"" account for fewer than 2% of murders, the 1994 AWB did not affect crime (FBI statistics), and gun crime in this country has been declining overall since 2004, when the last AWB expired. "

After dabbling in some philosophy for the past year I think I want to pursue studies in Artificial Intelligence.

I don't know if I want to work or study after that, please trust me it's not trying to be lazy I just haven't determined it yet. The point is I want to have a rewarding experience/land some sort of exciting position, in research or in tech.

At first, I wanted to apply to software development internships this summer, then I got rejected from one, and lost confidence that I had the skill set/interest level to do that. Then I got really turned on to REU's, found some programs I was really interested in, but am having trouble bringing myself to pretend that I have the academic preparation or work/research experience to be competitive for them. I have not made any promising relationships with my professors because I haven't had that good of professors. Basically I have high hopes and large aspirations but I consistently feel like I am hopeless when really all I have been doing is taking my major requirements. And I've gotten good grades in those.

My plan for the summer is to mostly relax and clear my mind before going to university, while possibly working on a relatively low-commitment internship, if that makes sense. 

I found a start-up working on a project that's very interesting to me. Unfortunately they don't have enough funding, so there's no physical office, and all the work being done on it is remote. The guy in charge of the project requested that potential workers should commit at least 4 hours of work per day. This seemed perfect because I could definitely put in that much time without having to leave the house.

I contacted the lead guy and asked if I could hop on board. He asked me a few questions (puzzle type questions and how much programming I know), and said that I seem like a good fit. I'm welcome to join the team for the summer.

I didn't ask about a salary, and it wasn't mentioned either. I mean, I don't mind working for free. I'm just looking to get my hands dirty working on some actual projects. I'm just not sure if something like this could legitimately be called an internship, since I'm not really being trained by anyone. Would this be more of a personal project or something along those lines? 

Apparently a few of the people working on the project are Stanford students, and since I live in the Bay Area I could contact them to see if they want to get together. But still, I'm not sure how remote programming works. Any insight would be appreciated.

The first position is with a plastics/chemicals company in their research center working on process development, simulation and modeling. I'd be working with several PhD's and it seems like a very technical position.

The second offer is from a major energy company in the pipeline integrity division. Would be working with engineers in a subdivision (maybe something along the lines of cathodic/anodic protection or corrosion prevention). Salary is about 10% more.

Thoughts: 
I feel it would be better for my development as an engineer to take the first position, but it's very tempting to take the second  because of the better pay and getting to work downtown in a highrise. It's very likely I end up working in the energy industry when I graduate (because of where I live), so experience in the industry would be valuable. There would be several other interns at the energy company, while I would be the only intern at the research center.

Questions:
Am I burning bridges with a company by rejecting their offer?
Would taking the first position make me less employable in the energy industry after graduation?

I am currently enrolled at my local community college full-time taking joke 100 level classes to fulfill my 150 credit hour requirement to become a CPA in New Jersey since all of my accounting and business courses were completed with my degree.  I plan on taking Becker's courses over the summer and attempting to pass 2 of the parts in the CPA exam before going back to the community college in the fall to finish my remaining classes for my 150 credits.  

-How tough will it be for me to find employment at an Accounting firm with my resume gap given my situation?  I am pretty sure the Big 4 is out of the question but many mid-sized firms are usually looking to hire new accountants.

-Should I wait to pass all 4 parts of the CPA exam before I apply for jobs to compensate for my lack of resume or will someone be willing to hire me if I tell employers in an interview that I am a CPA candidate?

-Will bringing up my poker background help me or hurt me when I am interviewing and explaining my resume gap?

Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated.  I honestly do not know what I am doing with my life but the short-term goal is to pass the CPA exam asap."
17aya2,1,2013-01-26,Starting Engineering at FSU...,Juliandres,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/17aya2/starting_engineering_at_fsu/,"Hey every body, I just transferred from Florida International University, (where I was studying finance), to Florida State where I changed majors to Mechanical Engineering. 

I left finance because I was lying to myself saying that's what I wanted to do because I felt studying business would be the easy route in college.

Over the summer I visited South Africa with my family and started flying lessons, this changed me completely, and I knew I had to be involved with engineering somehow. My only fear is that I didn't grow up around machines, building cars, fixing stuff up none of that and I feel that I won't succeed as well as others. Is there any advice to overcome this lack of experience? Things I should do, learn, etc.

I'm currently enrolled and working my ass off and I am really motivated I can't stop day dreaiming and thinking of motorcycles and planes I just know I want to be involved with them somehow, how can I be proactive in this field and learn more?

Lastly, what's the best way to get internships since I'm at a new school and new environment I don't have much friends and not sure what to do to get internships and meet the right people. I would love to design/craft motorbikes or planes, to be specific (In case I haven't already stressed that enough)

TL;DR: I just threw myself into Mechanical Engineering but never grew up around machines, what should I do, and what's the best way to get internships/experience with motorcycles or planes?  "

But after hundreds of applications and several failed interviews I finally came to the point of extreme frustration. Almost every hiring manager or recruiter that I have spoken to, basically told me that I was too under-qualified for the job. I did go to a 4 year university and I did have 1-2 years internship experience, but all the employers wanted someone more qualified. Which finally brings me to my final question. How can you land an entry level job after college, when the entry level work isn't so 'entry level'? If anyone has been in this sort of situation, or have any advice it would be great if you shared it. I greatly appreciate it."
17atz9,2,2013-01-25,Somebody made me feel absolutely worthless today.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17atz9/somebody_made_me_feel_absolutely_worthless_today/,"I know I can't really compare my troubles to those of some others, but something someone said really shook me up, and I just really need a place to let it all out.

When I was in high school, I was really depressed. Senior year had just started, but at the time I had no aspirations to do anything past graduation, and I felt... stuck. I don't know how I got to that point, but I felt that I had nowhere to go, and I didn't know how to get myself out. Sure, I kept busy;I played hockey, did some music here and there, but with the pressure of getting into college (I'm Asian, and my parents weren't helping to relieve the pressure, or willing to push me along in a direction... they simply told me to just figure it out, and fast) I felt as if I was at a crossroads with a million different connecting paths, but I simply couldn't make a choice, and frankly I didn't want to. At one point, I contemplated suicide, but with the help of some very close friends (and a TON of patience on their part) I was able to think at least a little bit about the future. It was at this juncture that I discovered several things, and all by chance:

Someone pointed me to this lecture that a man named Randy Pausch gave as he was dying of pancreatic cancer:
[Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ji5_MqicxSo)

And I discovered my love for classical music, particularly through this piece:
[Feel free to turn the volume up to 11 for this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rECVyN5D60I)

As I mentioned before, I played music here and there (I played the euphonium all through high school), and with the skill level I was at, there was a SLIM SLIM chance that I could turn something that I truly felt connected to into reality. Naturally, my parents were against this idea, and made little effort to help me realize this dream. So I saved my weekly allowance to get music lessons from someone who taught at a local university (and he did it out of pure generosity, too. Private lessons can cost a lot of money, but he let me pay what I could, when I could), and I worked my freaking butt off for three months, and then applied for some auditions at various colleges. After a nerve-wracking audition season, I finally got an admission letter (and from a good school, too!), and started my path in becoming a music teacher. 

A lot of truly amazing things have happened since then. I began cultivating my pedagogy, and through teaching private lessons, marching band, and my student-teaching internship, I discovered the formative power of music, and how it can be used to teach young people how to feel *powerful* through performance, and also how to feel truly relevant in their respective spheres of influence. I take Benjamin Zander's teachings to heart:

&gt; My power lies in my ability to make others **powerful**.

Lately I've felt so good about my life, about how far I've come, and about how I've been able to affect the lives of so many young musicians (and they've affected me in profound ways as well) but today, it took ONE person to say something nasty to me at work to make me feel worthless. I get it, I fucked up (one, we're human, and two, it really shouldn't have been as big of a deal as it should have been), but she embarrassed me in front of a client, and just kept screaming bloody murder. I'm not going to go into detail with what she said exactly, but with one sentence she managed to make everything I've worked for, everything that I've been teaching to my students about relevance seem worthless, and I haven't felt this depressed in several years. It just brought back memories of the kind of shit my mother used to say to me, and I thought I had moved past that point in my life. Also, today was the first day since I started working at this place that I hated being there. I know it took a while to get to this point, and I really don't know what I want from this rant. I think, maybe, I just want someone to tell me to ""hang in there,"" or maybe I just want the knowledge that someone, somewhere is reading this and thinking about me, even if it is for the minute or so that they read this. I really don't know.

Mostly, I just ~~want~~ need a hug."
17atsv,14,2013-01-25,"I hate myself sometimes, and I'm not sure why",throwawaylotion,sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/17atsv/i_hate_myself_sometimes_and_im_not_sure_why/,"I hate myself. Not all the time. Right now I do. And even when I don't, there is something in the back of my mind telling me how horrible I am. People put up with me. Nobody really, honestly, likes me. They listen to me out of courtesy. And all of that is okay because I hate most of them too.

I am a good student. I have a 4.0 right now and have an amazing internship lined up for this summer (4th semester CS student). I have a full life ahead of me, if I stick through with everything. I probably will. I almost always manage to do so. I am so hard on myself yet I think I am doing everything I'm supposed to in life. I'm nice to the people around me. I try not to let anybody feel left out. I am smart and can be funny. But I still think I am a horrible person. Sometimes I think about how I would commit suicide. Not seriously. I wouldn't ever do it, I still like being alive. But I do think about it.

I have had no patience with anyone lately, in my mind at least. I don't think I show it outwardly. I'm good at hiding my feelings from others. I can find a flaws about everyone I know. When I feel like I do now, I let my negative thoughts about them fester in my mind. I am cheerful with them, yet I don't really care about them and I think it might show when I am talking to them. Maybe that's why I don't have any friends. I guess I have friends, but none of them are very close. I don't like them very much anyways, so I guess it doesn't matter. I don't feel like anybody is really interested in what I am up to besides my Mom and my girlfriend. Maybe I am just so negative all of the time lately that I don't notice it when people take a geniune interest in me.

My girlfriend loves me so much it scares me. She has told me she would like to marry me. If I asked her she would say yes. But I am afraid that I am pushing her away by being so moody and out of whack lately. I guess its not a big deal though. I don't want to marry her. She cannot handle me emotionally and does not know how to deal with me getting so depressed. I love her, but I don't think I want to marry someone who doesn't understand me emotionally very well. She is super motivated and is a go-getter. Tomorrow she is running an event to for high-school girls at our university. She is coordinating over 100 people. She works three part time jobs, is an engineering student, and still manages put aside a ton of time to spend with me. When I feel happy things are wonderful with her. But when I am sad it is horrible. She does not know what to do. I am way more emotional than her and comforting me doesn't come naturally to her. She just asks me what she can do for me but I don't want to tell her what to do. I just want her to hold me and love me and ask me what is wrong sincerely. Instead she treads lightly around me when I am emotional because in her eyes I can be so unpredictable in that state. I guess not just in her eyes because I think I am unpredictable as well. Usually it just ends with her crying because when I'm sad it makes her sad. Or she gets frustrated with me because nothing she or does changes my horrible attitude. Neither of these options solve anything.

I can't control my impulses. It's been getting worse. I need to write an essay. I am pretty good at essays but it takes me a long time to write them. Every time I sit down I put it off by playing a video game or something. I have been eating too much. I exercised regularly for about two months but that stopped because my schedule doesn't work well with it. And it is so cold right now. I just can't bring myself to get up and go to the gym. It is so sad how lazy and demotivated I have become. Sometimes I get bored and I'll watch too much porn. My girlfriend and I don't have sex because she is Mormon. I am as well but I don't really believe. I'm not on a mission, obviously. But my parents (or mom at least) still think I might go. I guess I might. If I believed in Mormonism I would love to go on a Mission. It would let me to get away for a long time and devote myself entirely to a cause that would be noble in my eyes. I think that would help me. But then again I think I would just be running from my problems. That wouldn't solve a thing. So right now I'm in this position where my family and church leaders think I'm still giving the Mormon church an honest chance. I'm still going to church. But that's about it. I don't believe in it whatsoever. And I don't think that I ever will, although it would be nice to believe because it would solve some problems of mine. I wish I could just believe or come out to everybody and say that I don't believe (my girlfriend, family, and a few others do know that I don't really believe). Right now I'm just stuck in the middle. It's horrible not knowing what your place in life is. I don't know who I can turn to and be completely honest with myself besides the internet. How sad is that?

I went into a plasma donation center for the first time yesterday. I probably going to need some cash by the end of the semester before my internship starts. I have a little under $700 dollars to last me until the summer. Relistically I can only spend about $300 of that, because of bills and other large purchases I have to make. So anyways I went to the plasma center to donate. You get $55 if you donate twice in a week, and I figured if I donated for three or four weeks it will be enough to last me through the semester. On your first visit they have to give you an intesive physical to make sure you are fit to donate. When I was almost done with the physical they listened to my heart. Bad news. I have arrhythmia. Arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat. My heart is beating regularly in an irregular pattern. I had no idea. Talking with the medical staff at the center and doing some of my own research, I don't think it will be a big problem. It is fairly common and is usually not a big deal. But still... it could be bad. I am getting it checked Tuesday afternoon. I'm only 19. I'm too young for this to be happening. Even though I will probably be okay, it is kind of a wake-up call to the fragility of life. It makes you think.

In short, I think I am a horrible person. I have no real good friends besides my girlfriend. But I don't feel comfortable confiding in her about some things becuase of our religious differences and because she isn't too good with my emotions and feelings. I dislike most people I meet. I have trouble controlling my desires. I don't know what to do about my religion. I just discovered I have a potentially serious heart problem (but probably not a huge deal). I just don't like myself, and I can't figure out why. I have little self confidence. I put myself down. I am really negative about myself. I hate myself sometimes, yet I think I am a pretty good guy. I wouldn't consider trading lives with anybody else - I understand that many others have things far worse off than I do. My life needs some more order and discipline. I understand that. But I don't think things in my life are really that bad. So why am I so hard on myself?

So, internet stranger, if you have made it this far I commend you. This is a long block of text. If you think you have anything to say that might help me out or give me some perspective I'd appreciate it. If you don't have anything to say, that's alright. Thanks for reading.

EDIT: I'm doing quite a bit better. Putting this all into words helped me quite a bit. Thanks again for reading."
17asre,3,2013-01-25,Internship to Job,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17asre/internship_to_job/,"Hello r/Jobs, here's a quick summary about me: 

I'm 23 years old, a part time Information Systems student (junior) with a full time paid (no benefits) IT/help desk/sysadmin internship. When I first started interning (November 19th 2012), my contract was until December 31st 2012, to see if I fit in and was capable of the internship. The internship then got extended to March 31st 2013, so that's where I stand right now. I'm 110% positive that once March 31st comes around, my contract will be extended another 3 months if I agree to it. 

What I want to know is the correct way of going about asking my boss whether or not a permanent non-intern position may be available in the future.

My boss is the offices System Administrator/all around head of IT in our New York office, so I suppose the role I would want would be Junior Systems Administrator. I should also mention that they already rely on me a little bit. For example, this past week my boss was on vacation, so I had to take care of his responsibilities for the week because no one else in the office had the knowledge or access to.

I was thinking about asking him mid-March if there was a possibility of a position like that opening up or being created, not necessarily for when my contract ends on March 31st, but just in general, even if it's in say another 3 months after that.

Is it too bold to ask that after only 4 months interning at the company? I'm just worried they'll think I'm disposable and hire a new intern, so I don't know if I should wait 6+ months before asking, so it would be a hassle for them to train a new intern."

I hate seeing these kinds of threads, but I'm really curious as to what I'm worth.

I'm currently taking online courses from my local community college that goes towards a web design certificate. I also have a... (either internship or job, not sure what my status is right now) as a ""Junior front end developer"" at a web development company. We make Wordpress sites and social networks. I get paid $8/hr.

I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, SQL, and I'm very familiar with Wordpress. I also have a sexy resume, and a ~40 page portfolio that I should really update sometime soon.

So, how am I doing? Anything I should do or learn to improve myself? Suggestions? Anything? I'd love feedback.

There was plenty of time ahead for me to complete the project before the start of my full time internship, after which I would completely leave the freelancing world and tranfer my clients elsewhere. Everyone was well aware of it months in advance, and there was a generous buffer in case of trouble.

Obviously, this project turned into a complete nightmare. The print designer misquoted the project, delivered the materials 5 days prior to release, and mistook ""final requirements"" for a mere proposal. A week after the project was meant to be released, I was meeting the client to get a list of changes longer than my arm.

Normally, things would have been crystal clear, but due to a brain-dead print designer being the middleman, the client was promised much more than agreed for, and I kinda had to deal with it.

The site was released in a hurry with very little testing a *day* before I left for my internship because of repeated failures to acknowledge the meaning of ""final requirements"", and I'm stuck with a buggy project and an endless list of requests that I'm supposed to debug and complete after my 40 hour week.

I simply cannot see the end of it. The todo list keeps piling up, and I'm about to crack. I can't outsource it since there are no Django developers nearby, and I am positive that I won't be able to finish this project within the next month.

What can I do?

As you already know from clicking on this link, I am a 21 year old female from New Jersey. More specifically though I am generally located in the Ocean and Monmouth county areas. I go to school full time and I also work two jobs as well as an internship, I guess you could say I am busy and motivated! That being said, I really don't have much time to go out and meet people, so that is why I'm hoping reddit can help me out. What am I looking for? I'm not quite sure to be honest. New friends would be great and I could be open to the idea of a relationship if things click. I can tell you what I am not interested in, which would be hookups and head games.

I should probably follow that up with this: if you are going to pm me please do so from your regular account. Nothing sends my creep meter off the charts more than looking at a post history and all I see are comments in r/gonewild, r/porn, and the like. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with people doing that, but I would like to know the real you. 

More about me? Alright, if you insist..
I enjoy (most of the time) working out, so if you do too that's awesome, I could always use a gym buddy and a spotter for heavy lifts. If not, no worries. I'm not too much of a drinker but I do love a good beer every now and then. Maybe you could show me some good stuff! Ents are also welcome! I am also bilingual, así que si hablas español recibirás doble de puntos. Some other interests include the arts, movies, tattoos, men with beards (non bearded too!), and my eclectic taste in music. I used to play the guitar but not anymore. Now I just sing in my car at the top of my lungs making a fool of myself.

I don't even know if anyone reads these anymore, I find that there's just too many posts to look through most of the time. Ah well.

My progress this week has been alright, practiced quite a bit of speaking with my tutor, an area which I have been lacking in quite a bit since I don't usually have many people to speak with and I find I'm quite shy when it comes to speaking a language which I'm uncomfortable with (although I don't think I'm the only one out there who has this problem). Perhaps we could organise group discussions on a certain topic every week or something, similar to the grammar meeting jazz that's been going on. 

Specifically, I spent 1.5 hours on kanji, 2.5 hours on homework for my tutor / Japanese class, 1.5 hours with my tutor, and 3 hours at Japanese class. Although I've spent quite a bit of time on Japanese this week (in contrast to what I usually do) I don't feel like I've progressed much. In order to learn more grammar particals and such I feel that I learn that best through the genki textbook, but I find it difficult to fit in that extra bit of time to progress through the book. I suppose I'll challenge myself to just find some time to fit that in.

Oh, I also found out this week that I'll be heading to Japan in the Summer for 3 months! Pretty crazy, I've been once before for a month which was for a youth project kind of thing, but this time it will be for an internship. I have no idea how I'll be able to manage, but hopefully when the time comes I'll be competent enough to hold my own. Hopefully anyway.

It seems that I'm also aiming to complete both the N5 test and the GCSE test (the N5 was brought up by my tutor, and the GCSE by the Japanese class). Having both (or either) isn't really necessary, but I find it's quite a nice thing to aim for anyway. 

So this week, I aim to practice for GCSE / N5, homework for tutor / Japanese class and find time to study genki (AND ACTUALLY COMPLETE IT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD I'VE SAID THIS EVERY WEEK). If there's even one other person intersted in doing some talking exercises, I'd be well up for it, just say the word!

I had an internship, I became president of a club, and vice-president of another, I got a boyfriend and life was pretty awesome.

Right now, that has all aught to none. My parents became very passive aggressive to me and long story short there, they didn't enjoy my ""lifestyle choice"" and made it so that I couldn't get any of my scholarships and I can't return until I pay off my past due balance. My boyfriend is on this ""no-talking"" thing where he is unsure if he still wants to stay with me. I have no job and I've been trying and if I do not find one soon my landlord is kicking me out in two weeks. 

Never once through this have I thought my life is over, it just sucks right now. I feel completely abandoned and I have a hole in my being that I feel only my boyfriend could fill right now. He told me that I could count on him that I should share my burden and now when I finally said I would let him help me with my burdens, he left. It's been almost three weeks since I really talked to him, but last night he got mad at me because I didn't tell him I was in classes when I said I was going to. I thought I was, I really did, I was presumptuous and said I would, but I found out I couldn't and he said no talking. He got a new job and had car troubles and he didn't tell me. I figured big things weren't going to be discussed. He says it's a ""small job"" and he said it's not like he was keeping it a secret as it was on facebook, but I told him that he did not explicitly tell me. 

I'm just scared and lonely and feel like shit.   "
17e2kc,10,2013-01-27,Relationship that may have an expiration date- looking for advice,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17e2kc/relationship_that_may_have_an_expiration_date/,"I'm currently 22 and have been with most amazing guy I've ever met for the past two years. We love talking about the same things, teach each other, enjoy doing the same things with our spare time, have similar humor. I love his friends, and he loves mine. If we ever have a small argument, we can calmly talk things over. He supports me so much and advises me in everything I do. I'm pretty shy, and he makes a point to help me come out of my shell without making me feel embarrassed, and I've been able to share insecurities that I have- things I'd never thought I'd tell anybody. He makes me special presents and does cute things for me all the time. We have the same hopes for the future (travelling, number of kids, where/how to live, etc). Its the best relationship I can imagine, and its been consistent for 2 years. 

However, he leaving for a PhD program in May on the other side of the country (its the very best one in the country, and includes an internship at his dream company). For other reasons, I have to stay here for at least 2-3 years. We love each other very much, but committing to a 3 year relationship of seeing each other every 4 months for the next 3 years is rough; especially considering that we don't even know where we'll be with our careers at that point. 

Idk, I don't really have a question. Just wanted to rant, because I don't know how I'll be able to handle him leaving in May :( I just feel like no other guy is going to compare, ever. I'm going to compare every other guy to him and its never going to work. "

17dybi,3,2013-01-27,I am stuck,Noisebot,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17dybi/i_am_stuck/,"I think I'm broken. I need to go to the dentist, go to the doctor. I was told I should get a shrink. I can't find work. I'm going to college for what reason? I don't enjoy anything anymore. Leaving my room is a challenge. I have obligations and responsibilities that I don't care about, don't want to meet, don't matter. Typing this out is hard. I keep taking breaks to do other little things.

I live at home and go to school 4 days a week, full time student. I was going to major in engineering but I don't enjoy the math enough to go through with the years and years of education and internships and competition in the field, and shouldn't I major in something that I enjoy and want to do rather than something that will be potentially profitable in the future? Isn't it better to be poor but love what you do? I've been pushed into a major since middle school and I haven't had any chance to explore other options, so now I'm going to throw it all out the window and try new things next semester. I'll be letting down my mother, my mentor, my advisors, and everyone I talk to, right? Everyone expects big things from me, but I want to do things that are big to *me*. They'll understand, won't they? 

Sex. The sex is getting better. We're finally communicating about our desires and wants on a whole new level and she's very accepting of everything. The sex is good. It's never good afterwards though. I don't want to see her or talk to her or have anything to do with her after the sex, and I don't know why. I love her. I don't want to feel that way after feeling good with her, through her. I'm kept awake at night by fear of pregnancy, even with usage of birth control and condoms. I'm considering a vasectomy at a young age because I view children as the end. I don't want to give up my dreams, my future, my hopes, for someone else. I would never love that child. Sex makes me anxious because of this. But I don't have any hopes and dreams or future to give up right now. 

I don't have any aspirations or drive, aside from obligation to those around me. I have a scholarship, so I should go to college. I have to do things because I'm awake and present and they see me and they expect me to. Why can't I want to do things? I remember I used to have dreams. I was passionate about things when I was younger, but now I'm so cynical and jaded that I can't see anything as more than fleeting. I want to be in love with life again. I want to find what makes me happy and hold on to it forever. Not someone. I can't let myself be reliant on others for happiness. I'm not even happy with others, usually. 

My friendships are all crumbling away before my eyes because I barely have the energy to keep in contact with my friends, let alone go out with them. I never contact them first. When they do get in touch with me, our conversations are one sided and reluctant because I don't know what to say or how to respond or even if I should if I'm not going to be engaged in the conversation. I like my friends. I don't dislike my friends. Even through all this I crave human interaction and find it through semi-anonymous online interactions on chatrooms and forums, where people know me through my username and only my username. People can't read my facial expressions or try to find my true feelings there. 

I've worked so hard since 2007 to build up this facade of stoicism and strength. A silent observer with novel insight when prodded. People come to me for help all the time -- school help, romance help, relationship help, self-help, life help -- and I eagerly help them. I like helping them. I like helping other people. But the more I help them, the less I feel like I'll ever be able to help myself. I don't want to rely on someone else to get me through my slumps and lift me up from these down periods, why can't I do it myself? Why can't I be self reliant?

Because I can't find a job. I live in chain-store suburban hell. Where am I supposed to go when Wal-Mart and the major grocery chain both turn me down? A job that was practically janitorial only gave me a ""We have reviewed your application and regret to inform you..."" message. What can I do if I'm not even qualified to mop floors and take out the garbage? What am I supposed to do? I feel like if I don't find work soon, my relationship will fall apart. She thinks I'm a deadbeat, doesn't she? Wouldn't anyone? I live at home, no job. Isn't that the definition of a deadbeat? I did well in school, I have community service behind me, years in ROTC, awards and recommendations, encouragement and sources, but I can't even get an interview. I haven't heard back from a single real person. Maybe they aren't real. 

Sometimes I think my grasp on reality is slipping. I'll see pictures of other people and wonder why I'm looking at them and try to figure where I integrate those events into my life. I can't. Why would I? Those people aren't me. That never happened to me. I can't remember what I never did. My empathy only goes so far as to allow me to connect with people who come to me for help, I'm paranoid about everyone else. I don't think my friends actually like me. I'm sure it's all just an act. Mom says it's okay to live with her as long as I'm going to school or working, but I know that's not true. I need to leave. I need to branch off and start my own life. I should have left a long time ago. I can't be a real person until I'm independent. I remember my dreams as memories and it has gotten to the point that I have difficulty differentiating the two. When I wake up I don't know what day it is until I check a calendar. I know something terrible is going to happen. Something awful. Crippling. It sits in the back of my mind, nagging me, an awful dread of nothing in particular. So I sit and worry and panic and fidget and twitch and think and think and think.

I could see someone for help, but won't they just drug me up? I don't want to be medicated. I don't want to gain 30lbs and be drooling and complacent all the time. I don't want to lose this part of me, even if it's a part of me that's holding me back. Is it holding me back? Can't I integrate these little bits of me into myself and move forward? What's holding me back? Self-help books and internet philosophers will say that the only thing holding me back is me. Is that true? Who can I ask?

I can't ask anyone. I don't talk to anyone. I keep people at a distance, because I *know* that I have to deal with my problems myself. If I can't help myself, how can I help others? How can I make other people feel safe and content if I can never feel that way? I can't be reliant on other people. I have to figure this out. I can't tell other people. They always treat me differently when I tell them everything, they act like I'm damaged goods, so vaguely condescending and piteous towards me and that makes me resent them. They don't take me seriously anymore. 

No one takes me seriously because I've never done anything worth taking seriously, and I don't know how I could. And I don't know where to go from here. My physical health is slowly deteriorating. I rarely drink water, or anything, anymore. There's something loose in my knees that pops out when I bend them. No matter how clean my mouth is, an awful stench rises from inside me. I see dark spots and bright flashes of light in the peripheral of my vision more and more frequently. I can only stay awake for a few hours at a time before falling back to sleep. I feel like I'm losing my ability to talk, everything is slowly becoming more and more muted muttering and stumbling over words where I used to be able to dictate properly. I don't smile very often. I only laugh when I'm tired. I would like to properly feel excitement, joy, sorrow, anger, anything besides this frustration. I miss feeling. 

I'm probably going to delete this after I post it because I'm so uncomfortable sharing this. I'm not posting this from a throwaway because it is probably a plea for help, but I don't know help with what. Thank you for your time, sorry for your time. Maybe I'll feel better now."

Anyway, getting laid off next month and think this is a perfect time to intern in the web development field. But I don't think I understand my options well. 

I love working in code but have been having trouble picking up JS (that might be because I don't have anywhere to apply it right now so I forget what I learn). My favorite thing is to have code not work and figure out why. I love the problem solving of it. Because of my experience in marketing I can make things graphically appealing but that's not my passion. 

I was thinking looking for a front-end position might be a good foot in the door but now I'm wondering if it might be more graphically based and not enough raw coding. 

I went on an internship interview with a web development company and the guy suggested I might enjoy being a programmer? Not really sure what that means. 

Anyway, I don't know what kind of position I want to end up in. Any explanation of job titles would be greatly appreciated. My biggest passion is problem solving to get code to behave the way I want. Any advice?

Ps. I have opportunities to be a paid front-end web developer/creative designer or take that internship while receiving unemployment.  "

I'm an aspiring creative, fresh out of uni (BA English Language). I have one agency experience (a big agency). 

Now I don't like advertising. I love it. This is what helped me plow through uni until this internship. It's when all changed. 

The dynamics inside the agency I was at were... weird. In the following lines I might sound like an ass. I might be an ass. I don't know. 

My assigned partner had issues. My managers, for some reason kept on suffocating any creativity coming from the both of us. I can go in more detail but I see no point. 

The internship ended and I started calling creatives in other agencies, looking for advice, improving my book and what-not. After careful consideration I realized I need more education so I decided I am going to apply for an ad school. 
This is the part where shit hits the fan. 
I lost my drive, my mojo, i cannot write nor draw. I lost any belief in my abilities. And in couple of days I'll have to convince a bunch of interviewers that I am better than 500 other people. My book is shit. And all I touch is shit. (Like the King Midas of toilets)

So I need your advice, I need your guidance.

17di04,5,2013-01-27,"Graduated with a BS in CS in 2011, thinking about grad school for fall 2014, could use some general advice/guidance",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17di04/graduated_with_a_bs_in_cs_in_2011_thinking_about/,"Hi everyone, I've been out of school for almost two years and am looking into pursuing graduate school. I'm not sure if I've got some crystal-clear questions yet but I was hoping someone would be able to read this and give any pointers or suggestions if any pop out at them.

I suppose I'll offer some general background. I got a bachelor's in CS from the University of Utah in 2011, had a GPA between 3.6-3.7. The summer after graduation, I did an internship at a small solutions company in the Kansas City area, doing mobile and web-app development for various area businesses. From September 2011 to July 2012 I was over in China teaching English as one of those ""gap year"" ""broadening your horizons"" sorts of things, and when I came back I started up work at the same solutions company, as a full employee currently making 55k.

At this point I think I want to do grad school, because even though during college I only pushed for a BS because I knew that I could do decently in a career with just a BS, the sort of work I do now, while at times fulfilling in a problem-solving sense, doesn't seem greatly significant. Perhaps this is just some delusion of grandeur talking, but I really would want to work on something that can advance the world/humanity/something big like that. Maybe it's just a desire to work on more cutting-edge unprecedented things than corporate web portals or contact syncing mobile apps. Research and academia seems like an avenue that can provide that, plus just a desire to keep on learning and do it in depth.

I suppose that one barrier I've got is that, while I made some contacts/networking with faculty via some NSF-funded STEM outreach endeavors and undergrad TA work, I never did research or strongly connected with that side of academia while I was in college. Is this something that I can work through when applying for grad schools, or is it sort of a system where, if you weren't part of that ""going to grad school"" mindset when in undergrad, then getting in now is really hard?

I guess another question I've got is how on earth to specialize when it comes to CS. When I got into my last year of undergrad, I remember everyone talking about specialization and felt lost. I had taken a range of classes and subjects but didn't dedicate myself to a particular field of CS study like AI or robotics or something like that. As a result I think my education was sort of undifferentiated and the post-college work I've done is mobile/webdev because it seemed like a default thing to do. Since I would be looking to apply for a fall 2014 semester, I've got this year to figure everything out, actually take the GRE tests, and do all that. I'm wanting to figure out what on earth I should commit myself to when it comes to a CS specialization -- if I'm to work on something important and groundbreaking and cutting-edge in the field, it's not going to cut it to be a jack of all trades and master of none. I've been doing a fair number of Coursera/MOOC classes while I've been working, but I guess I'm also curious about ways to figure out what part of CS really calls to me.

I hope this all doesn't seem too rambling or wishy-washy. I guess in general I'm looking to know if my goals are on the right track (or how to know if they are or not), and what pitfalls or challenges might affect me in particular and what I can do to work through them. Thanks for reading!"

17daqs,11,2013-01-27,Help!!! Dealing with hopeful/slightly delusional crushes,22andwaiting,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/17daqs/help_dealing_with_hopefulslightly_delusional/,"Hi AL! I really need to get this off my chest.

I came out 8 months ago, and while that may seem like a good amount of time, my coming out is limited to a handful of close friends with whom I rarely discuss my sexuality because a) I'm still very shy about it and b) in spite of their best intentions I don't think they offer me too much help (understandably so). 

There's been this thing I've been dealing with since coming out. I'm finding that ever since I became open to myself and eventually open to my close friends, I've been allowing previously suppressed thoughts to actually wander in my mind. For example, before coming out I would mentally chastise myself for finding a girl attractive. I'd try my best to put a halt to it immediately and pretend as if it never happened. It was hard, but to be honest I got so used to it that sometimes it became frighteningly easy.

These days, I'm out in my mind, accepting of myself, and know that my friends love me for who I am. I'll see an attractive girl and admire her beauty from afar, wonder if there's any chance she'd be gay. Sometimes at bars I'll talk to one of my friends about who I find attractive, but that's basically the farthest it'll go. When I'm alone, though, that's when things get difficult.

I was recently an intern and experienced the closest thing to ""love at first sight."" God... this woman... everything about her initially was jaw-dropping. Over the course of working there, the more I got to know her the deeper I fell under her spell. I got butterflies from just being around her, seeing her beaming smile, and definitely lost the ability to function properly when she spoke to me. I acted like a complete idiot around her, but as sad as it sounds, I felt so damn lucky to just have met her, let alone work with her. Things got worse when my crush intensified...

After I admitted to myself that I had this crush on her, any teenie little microscopic thing that even HINTED at her sexual orientation made my mind SPIN. ""OMG, she just said that she loves the gay girl in Glee."" ""NO FUCKING WAY... she tweeted about equal rights and gay marriage."" ""....ohhh mmmmyyyyy.. she's wearing plaid."" 

These little things drove me absolutely insane. It was as if I was searching far and wide for the slightest bit of hope that maybe, just MAYBE, she was gay. This hope wasn't even connected to me having a chance with her, but the idea of it seemed as if it would've... I don't know, meant I was on the right track? I'm not articulating this correctly... perhaps it's because I don't even really know why I wanted her to be gay so badly! 

I eventually found out she's in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend - part of me wasn't surprised, and the other hopeful/delusional part of me died a little. Why did I feel this way?!?!? Have you ever felt something similar? How did you deal with it? Thanks in advance.. and I hope I got my story across."
17d6bn,1,2013-01-27,"My boyfriend (26M) won't stand up for me (23F), and I really don't know how to deal with this. Am I overreacting? Please help me shed some light on this situation.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17d6bn/my_boyfriend_26m_wont_stand_up_for_me_23f_and_i/,"My SO and I have been together for about a year, and we have been good friends for almost 10 years before we started dating. He is absolutely wonderful, he makes me laugh and I really love him. There's just this one thing that keeps bugging me, and I just can't seem to let it go. 



**Some back story for context:** My teen years weren't all that easy. My parents divorced when I was 11, and after that my father started to become abusive towards me and me sister. Nothing sexual, but physical and mental abuse. We found out that he had been abusive towards our mother this entire time, and when they divorced he had done something illegal and absolutely appalling to her. I still, to this day, can not understand that he actually did this. I have friends and family here on reddit, so I won't go into detail, because I wish to remain anonymous. (Sorry, guys!)


Anyway, because of my father and his ways I started drinking heavily at the age of 15, and when I was 17 I turned to drugs. On my 18th birthday, I was raped and that fueled my drug abuse even further. I was slipping further and further down this spiral, and didn't give a shit about myself or anything else. Eventually, a year and a half ago, I started getting these reaaaally bad panic attacks, and just went around with anxiety 24/7. I developed a deep social phobia due to the drugs. I just stopped functioning. Hid in my apartment and got high all day long.


One day I just had enough. The thing is, when I commit to something 100%, there is no other option. I quit cold turkey, said goodbye to all my friends who were using (which was 98% of them), and gave up that life completely. Even though I was all alone, I at least didn't do drugs anymore. I started counselling and working through all the shit I had been through. 


In the midst of getting clean, I reconnected with my friend, who is now my boyfriend. He was a tremendous help to me, without even knowing it. He pushed me to do things and get out of my comfort zone. I honestly don't know where I'd be today without him. I eventually told him a lot of what has been going on, not revealing too much at once, because I don't want to freak him out. He doesn't know about the rape yet, but he knows my father was abusive (not all the details) and he knows about my drug/alcohol abuse. He has been my rock, and every time I have a bit of a breakdown he is right there consoling me and making it all better. 

**Now to the issue at hand:** I have been unemployed for over a year. My social phobia and anxiety, even though it has improved, is still hanging over me like a dark cloud, and the thought of someone telling me I have to be in one place from 8-5 every day just makes it all worse. I have to take babysteps. I am starting an internship in just a few weeks, where I will start off with two days a week, and then I will gradually increase the amount of time I spend at the office and away from home (my comfort zone). Eventually I will be at ease with the thought of working 5 days a week. My therapist has been very involved in all of this, and I have complete faith in him. I am actually really looking forward to it.


My boyfriend is aware of all this, and very understanding. He accepts that it will take some time before I can start working again. The thing is, his family is not so understanding. To them I am a lazy ass girl, who just spends all her days doing absolutely nothing. They are friendly when I'm around, but always brings up ""the work situation"", roll their eyes when I give them my answer. Since I don't want to tell them everything that I've just told you, because honestly it's none of their business, and it's not something I like to share, I have to just keep making up lies as to why I don't work. We live in a small town and work is generally hard to find, so I have just told them I've applied for this and that job, but didn't get it. The past few months, the lying has been eating away at me, and I realize that they are starting to think more and more that I just don't want to work. They have confronted my boyfriend, and he just affirms my story at the time. I have asked him several times to just say to them to lay off me, and that I have a good reason for not working right now, and that they should just respect that. But he just doesn't do it. He says he will, but when push comes to shove, he doesn't do a god damned thing.

Another problem is the alcohol. This family and their alcohol. They drink all the time. They talk about alcohol all the time. They take trips just to try out new beers. They are bordering on alcoholics. And they just refuse to accept that I don't drink. Even though I politely turn down the glass of wine, beer or whatever, they just pour it up anyway and place it in front of me. I just leave the glass sitting there the entire night, and ask for a glass of water instead. They get so pissed off. The dad takes it as an insult. He even corks up expensive wine bottles JUST because I'm coming over. Even though I've explained to him OVER AND OVER that I do not drink. And my boyfriend doesn't say a word. Is it so hard to just say: ""Hey dad, she doesn't want a beer. Okay? Lay off her."" If the roles were reversed, I wouldn't hesitate to tell my family to leave him alone and respect his choices. 


I am at a point where I'm ready to blow with this family. I want to just stand up at the dinner table and scream at them and tell them everything that has happened just to get them to shut up. But that is in the heat of the moment. I don't want them to know. I want them to respect my/our boundaries. I want my boyfriend to just stick up for me and tell them to stop butting in and just accept that I will work when I work, and I will never want a beer. 

Am I unreasonable? I just keep thinking if the roles were reversed and he had had a substance abuse problem, and my family pestered him to drink, I would be furious at them. My boyfriend says he isn't scared of confrontation, but I don't know. It feels like he is. 

Please, fellow redditors, help me handle this situation before it gets out of hand. I love my boyfriend, and I don't want to be forced to tell my story to these people.

Sorry if there are any spelling/grammar mistakes. English is not my first language. And sorry for the wall of text. Thank you for reading, those of you who do!

**TL;DR: I was addicted to drugs/alcohol for 5 years, got clean a year ago after i developed extreme social phobia and anxiety. Haven't worked this year, and boyfriends family won't lay off me about working and also they are bordering on alcoholics who won't accept that I don't drink. I don't want to tell them anything about why I don't work at the moment, or why I don't drink. My boyfriend won't stick up for me, just let's it go on.**"

I have an internship in SF for the whole summer (May 25thish-August17thish) and want to sublease your place while you sublease my place in Ocean Beach, San Diego, CA. I know it's kind of a long shot to find mutually compatible requirements, but I thought I'd try.

Here are my requirements: I need an apartment/studio that can accept me, my SO and our cat.  I'd like to be in SF but Oakland or Berkeley could work too.  We need a bed, kitchen, and we don't want roommates or a room in a shared house.

Our house: 1 bedroom 1960s beach cottage (not attached to another house or anything) around 500 square feet.  Fully furnished, has a large (for a small house) kitchen with gas burners/oven, a renovated bathroom, desk, shelving, small back area, tv, wireless internet, lots of windows, 6 blocks from the beach.  Our house is on a lot with one tiny house in front of us and another tiny house behind, so we don't really hear street noise.  Street parking is OK: I never have to park more than two blocks away.  Only takes 10 minutes to drive downtown (Hwy 8), lots of restaurants, shops, laundry, etc. within walking distance. Chill, safe neighborhood. I'm a woman and not afraid to walk around by myself at night.  Never had any issues with break-ins or other crimes.  

Let me know if you're interested.  I'll provide pics if you're serious! :)"

I'm thinking about getting a tattoo, and was hoping you could clear up a couple of things:

First off, it'd be a simple script ""For the Greater Good"", probably in large and half-sized capital letters. It wouldn't be overly large, but easily visible any time I wore a short-sleeve shirt. 

* How seriously does this affect my job prospects? (I have a government internship at the moment that I'd love to turn into a job)
* Should I just bump the tattoo up onto my inner bicep instead of the forearm to fix this problem?
* How serious an issue is deformation/sagging with tattoos on the bicep? I'm certainly not jacked, but I have a respectable amount of muscle and tone. Likewise, is stretching a big issue?
* Does getting stabbed with a needle hurt? /s (yeah, I know...)
* Should I just check for samples of the artist's lettering to check who should do it?

EDIT: To remove pricing question

Thanks!"

I knew I needed to get it off my chest, but at the same time not risk being someone who spoke for mere posterity…this is what prevented me from publishing it until now. However, given what see on TV, social media, etc. and what is, indeed, the underlying psychological and ethical struggle beneath the political and social conflicts going on in America today, I needed to get this to the surface. So, I do implore you to read all of this, the TL;DR will not convey it fully.

From a very young age, I was very gifted. At least, that’s what I was told. Even when my age was still in the single digits I would wow even adults with my ability to astutely observe and quickly process the information around me. When I was in first and second grade, the teacher needed to create a new list of spelling words just for me; I knew how to spell all the words my classmates were learning and what they meant. I was the “smart kid”, the one who was helping other students, correcting the teacher, etc. On the other hand, I was an extremely emotional child who was very sensitive about people’s feelings. I also had a very unique set of interests. Playing sports and games was boring; spending hours brooding over maps and figuring the locations of the world’s major cities, reading books about cars and the Titanic, pulling grass out of a field to see what it was made of, that was fun. I had a massive imagination, and making up stories in my head was a lot of fun as well. I was exceptionally well-behaved, partially out of fear for my disciplinarian parents, partially because I just didn’t see the logic in misbehaving. 
In elementary school I was actually really admired by classmates (at least it seemed I was), but then middle school came about, and suddenly everything turned around. I was the outcast, the smart awkward kid, the one with no social skills. As you probably have guessed, I was made fun of. **A lot**. But it wasn’t just merely teasing by a few people. There were those who were especially bitter, but even the “friendlier” kids showed trepidation, if not animosity. And it only got worse. I would be humiliated, tortured on a daily basis, much more so than the average “nerdy” kid (there were plenty of those). I wasn’t “nerdy” – I was something worse. Of course, the teachers loved me; I was well-behaved and **very** smart…yet, my self-esteem was low, and in retrospect I think that’s why I got great grades, but not the best. 

I could have killed myself, it was that bad. I thought about it every day. But I didn’t, for a very distinct reason. As I would cry over dinner every night, my parents would always, without fail, tell me the same thing. I was smart, a brain, gifted, and one day, if I worked hard enough, I would be able to buy and sell the families of all the kids who tormented me. One day, when I grew up, I could show off all my fancy new cars to those meatheaded shits. All those girls who ostracized me, and made fun of me behind my back, one day they would all (especially the hot ones) want to marry me. Because I would be rich. Wealth would be my way getting back at them. This was attainable, because I was smart – and well-behaved and motivated. However, my father was quick to point out that in order to be the best, to beat them, I needed to sacrifice my childhood for this cause. The ones who lost the game were the ones who spent their time hanging with friends and goofing off instead of studying and working hard.

So, from the time of my thirteenth birthday, I set out to make it my life’s mission to beat them all, though brains and work and good behavior. I had completely unrealistic goals (it was over if I got a 92 instead off 100 on that test), which soon developed into delusions of who I could become, and needed to become in order to be that rich guy. I became extremely short-tempered, dissatisfied with everything, aggressive, hypercritical – because I knew that was the tenacity I needed. I kept the anxiety up to keep myself alert. Sports, games, hanging out, these were all just wastes of time, and they were what the loser kids did – the ones with no future. In a bizarre way, it gave me a means to stave off the pain and isolation. When I was sexually assaulted in a gym locker room my freshman year of high school, or when the girl I had a crush on for a year humiliated me in front of everyone, I could simply pent it up inside, because the pain was just a step into me turning into a confident, wealthy, successful adult who had awesome stuff, that every girl wanted to be with.

**The thing is, that’s not how it turned out.**

Facebook is an extraordinary thing in that you can re-connect with many people you haven’t talked to in years, people really underestimate how powerful that can be. Many of those kids in middle and high school, the ones who beat me up, called me names, ostracized and humiliated me, they’re doing pretty well. I mean there are some deadbeats, but most of them have jobs or went good schools, have lots of friends, and are in steady and it appears loving relationships. Sometimes I’ve spent hours browsing through hundreds of their pictures and I see all the places they’ve gone, fun crazy times they’ve had with friends they’ve had for a lifetime. I mean, they’re usually not wealthy or powerful, but they’re at least somewhat content with their lives and comfortable in their own shoes.

So where am I now? What happened to the “smart kid”?

I won’t mince words here. My life is a mess. Its extraordinary only in how pathetic it is. I’m a 23 year old college senior, I go to a small, technology-focused, closed-minded school that’s overpriced to shit, and I’m burdened with debt. I’m in far too much debt to pursue a PhD (what I want to do) and my grades aren’t good enough for a fellowship. I spent over twenty months working in internships full-time (this is why I picked the school I go to), and I was miserable and dissatisfied all the times I’ve worked. I tried reviving an Engineers Without Borders chapter at my school, with only modest success. I co-managed a nonprofit for a while, but that fizzed out somewhat as well. 

At school, because I was boring and over-driven, I’ve pretty much ended up surrounding myself with the same kind of people, but even then I feel isolated amongst my “friends”. In a small school, most people barely even know me. Making and keeping friends is hard, relationships are impossible. The closest thing I’ve ever had to having a girlfriend was something that lasted about a month and we’re not on speaking terms – I’ve only lost my virginity relatively recently. In social settings I’m either overcome with anxiety or I just can’t strike up a conversation. I don’t play any sports, I don’t have a big physical outlet, I can’t play a musical instrument, I don’t speak any other languages. So, I’m pretty boring; I spend most of my spare time browsing the web looking at cars and political stuff. 

What really hurts the most is the isolation, my sheer inability to connect with anyone. Over the long nights I spend essentially by myself, I can observe how inhibition has crippled me. I’m surrounded by walls built of cynicism, envy, competitiveness, apprehension, guilt, and shame. But the walls surround an empty courtyard. There’s no fun, no joy, and any laughs are mean-spirited. I went to a therapist for over five years, but to little avail. I tell myself that I’ll get out of this, I know what to do to improve my lot. I spend a long time looking over self-help material like Seddit and other things, and I try, I try hard, and it just hasn’t worked out yet. When I was in Boy Scouts, they used to call me **“Shadow”**, and now that term still applies to the empty shade of a person I’ve become. 

We could argue that I was a good person who just wanted to fit in and was struck down by all the mean, bad people who made fun of me. That’s after all, what society wants us to think. But the truth is, **everything that is fucked up about my life is because of decisions that I consciously made**. The only person to blame is me. Plenty of other people have had even more fucked up childhoods yet they’ve ended up alright because they’ve made good out of their plight. But vengeance, the placing of myself on a higher plane than anyone else, is what made me this way. Its now such an essential part of who I am that every day I still criticize that young boy who talked with his classmates about old ships and knew all the capitals…the critic is that angry, insecure, sad, scared little teenager I still am. 

My story is sad and horrible, but what are the implications of it? In working in non profits and taking dabbling in progressive activism, I have seen the effects of the world espoused by the likes of Mitt Romney, Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch, the Koch brothers and other personalities of the New Right. I’ve read and heard intensively their fierce rhetoric, about how the poor are lazy and don’t deserve healthcare or a decent living, about how corporations and big, aggressive business bring the most benefit to humanity. Many of my colleagues look to this incredulously, they just can’t understand how these angry, sexually-repressed old men can say these things and have such massive followings? 

Its really quite easy. The New Right and the neo-capitalist and neo-libertarian ideologies are actually not that at all. They’re not intellectually based, they don’t use empirical or historical evidence, those things really don’t matter to them. **The new “conservatism” is really based on a twisted, perverse revenge fantasy**. The poor, the people on food stamps and with no medical insurance are actually those kids who made fun of you, they were the “popular” kids who were having sex with the girl you had a crush on the Saturday night you spent studying. Hence, it feels good to spit on the poor, they fucking deserve it don’t they. When I see the blatant greed that goes on, that’s tearing the world apart, I have a bit of an edge over most “liberals”. When I see people in Africa starving because of unfair practices by food corporations, or people dying of pollution from companies that make luxury goods, when a plan to ensure Americans have healthcare is decried as part of a Marxist revolution, I can feel it.  I know exactly where its coming from.

I hope that my story can be taken as a lesson, or at the least a warning. I believed that greed was good, that I could sacrifice being a kid, having fun, enjoying life in order to “lead” others. And now I’m all alone, left to contemplate the rotten conscience I’m left with. If you’re in the position I was in, I implore you, I beg of you, please don’t get angry, don’t let vengeance or delusions of power and wealth and  leadership guide your life. Have fun, find people to love, be open-minded, find joy in simple things. 

Learn to love who you are, before its too late for you to define yourself. Don’t be like me, don’t let anger and hate for the bad in life bring you down, before you bring down others, and the world, around you.

I graduated about a year ago with a bachelor's degree in Communication and I live in the Midwest. While that's typically not a great degree in this economy or this area, I've been employed by a very well-known and respected ad agency for a little over six months now. My internship in college was in NYC with one of the big TV news outlets. Not trying to be cocky, but I have a good resume for being a year out of school and I'm really, really trying to preserve it. 

I'm extremely thankful for being employed. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate where I'm at when I see so many on this subreddit suffering in unemployment. But I'm genuinely unhappy. I find advertising to be wholly unrewarding, soul-crushing and morally bankrupt. I sell unhappiness and consumerism for a living in a high-stress, low-pay environment and it's starting to affect who I am outside of work.

When I first graduated I was trying to get back to NYC where I'd done my internship and now I'm really considering giving it a try once again. 

However, I've only been at this job for a little over 6 months and I'm worried that 1) it's going to make me look like a job jumper and 2) nobody will take me seriously. Maybe this shows my age and immaturity, but I know that if I got hit by a bus tomorrow I'd regret sitting in a cubicle for 50 hours a week and not going after a dream.

Has anyone else had this experience? Any advice? Tough love?


TL;DR: Trying to preserve a decent resume but leave a job after only 7 months and move to NYC. WTF do I do?"

**Some ramblings:**
I honestly don’t know what I’m looking for right now. There are so many things on my plate right now, and adding much more to it might just crush me, but here I am. I guess I’m just feeling lonely. I have friends, but I guess they’re just not satisfying an unknown thirst that I am experiencing. 

**A little about myself:**
I am a born and raised Oregonian, 6' tall, living in Corvallis, OR, attending Oregon State University (Go Beavers!), and I’m studying Fermentation Science and Microbiology (let me know if you want to know more about this). I’m currently on the prowl for internship opportunities, which is proving to be quite stressful and it’s really getting me down. Some more about myself: I love to swim, hike, white water raft, camp, fish, play video games, listen to music, watch movies and TV shows (although I don’t have cable), and brew beer. I’m a super nerd, introverted, socially awkward, the works. I think that’s a good bit of information about myself to get a conversation started. 

**Some more ramblings:**
A relationship has never been one of my top priorities, but slowly it’s becoming more and more apparent that it is something that I would really enjoy having. Especially during these stressful times when a hug from someone I love could cure it all (even if it’s only a temporary cure). But alas, I don’t have a lot of time to spend on going out and finding someone. And thus I present to you my predicament, and my reason for posting here. 

**What I want:**
Someone who is willing to take the time to get to know me. Someone who loves and embraces my many quirks. Someone who is patient, because my free time is very limited with school and everything else that I’m trying to juggle. Someone who enjoys some of the things (definitely not all) that I enjoy. Someone who is honest (almost brutally so), caring, and as quirky (if not more) as myself. Maybe I’m asking for too much, but I honestly don’t expect you blow me away with how awesome you are. Just be you, and be genuine.

I think I’ve rambled enough. I hope to hear from a few of you soon. I hope you all have a wonderful evening, and I appreciate that you took the time to read my post.

P.S. I feel like I need to emphasize, again, that I really do have very little time to spare, and thus I may not be able to respond to your messages (if I receive any...I’m being optimistic) as fast as I might like. So please please please be patient, and don’t give up on me too quickly. :)

TL;DR...You should really consider reading the whole text, and if you're really so lazy that you can't/won't read the wall of text, you're probably not worth my time. Also, NOT interested in sexting/skype-fun/dick-pics/the works."

I'm in a perplexing situation. I am 26, have my own free cash flow generating business which allows me to live comfortably although a bit time consuming at times, but my interests is in the stock market; it has been since I was 15.

My problem is: How do I obtain a credible financial internship while also keeping an eye on my business? 

My business is a bakery so there is a lot of labor hours with the hard parts hired out. If you have no experience in the small business world, then a good thing to keep in mind is that there is a lot more to do than meets the eye.

Optimally, I would like to work for a firm that is understanding of my situation and would allow me to test out the finance world at a part time/flexible schedule, but I fear this is too good to be true.

I took a business valuation course last year where I had to value a company. Being the ambitious man that I am, I decided to pick a completely random company i.e. the first firm on the list to research because I wanted to test my skills. The company was AES. The professor, told me my paper was nearly perfect and all he recommended was to switch one paragraph in the introduction around from last to first statement. Other than that my analysis of AES was spot on and months-year later as the stock market was rocketing upwards AES fell - like I said it should. Essentially, my analysis told me that for every dollar the company would earn within the next 10 years you would be paying 2 dollars for it.

So, this gave my motivation to really start my finance career, but my dilemma. Worse of all, I'm in the west coast. :x"

17cm0g,9,2013-01-26,Incoming pharmacy students: What I think you should do to prepare the summer before pharmacy school,lponced2002,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/17cm0g/incoming_pharmacy_students_what_i_think_you/,"This goes out to those worried or futuristic students who are just now getting accepted, and preferably, students who don't have much experience actually working in a pharmacy. So, the question is: ""What exactly should I do to better prepare myself for the madness that is pharmacy school?"" I know this question gets thrown around a lot during the summer, so hopefully students utilize the search function when that time comes. 

 So, here are my 5 simple rules to preparing for pharmacy school: 

**1) Begin developing good habits.** This means STOP CRAMMING! (I know it's a little too late for this in summer, but you get the idea). If you are currently in school, try it out. Begin planning ahead. Keep a calendar and planner (if you already don't have one). More importantly, pick up a fun, long-term hobby. This can be exercising, playing a sport, dancing, singing, cooking, becoming a chest grandmaster, whatever! The point is you want to lead a balanced life in order to de-stress during the difficult times in pharmacy school. 


**2) Develop networking skills.** Since the job market is narrowing, it is important to develop relationships that will last you throughout your career. I am often told that obtaining a job after pharmacy school may not necessarily be due to merit, yet instead, relies more on the people that you know. Begin making the effort to meet new people. Practice remembering the names, and finding conversation. Ask for a facebook add, email, or phone number to stay in touch. These skills should help for when you actually do become involved in organizations and conferences in pharmacy school. 


**3) Find a mentor** Out of all of your friends and family, you have to be able to find a pharmacist. If not, go to a pharmacy and tell them that you are beginning pharmacy school. I know this may be difficult without an intern or tech license, but ask him or her if you can shadow or work. If not, obtain their contact information, and use them as a source for questions. Ask how the job market is, how to improve yourself, and how a pharmacy simply works. And who knows.. maybe after you get your intern license, they'll end up hiring you. 


**4) Learn your word roots.** Many times, students try to think ahead by wanting to get started on actual pharmacy school material. Forget about that! There is simply too much to learn, let alone by yourself. Something I found interesting in pharmacy school was the amount of health jargon in every class. I would even go on to say that medical talk is like learning a new language. My suggestion would be to memorize medical word roots. You can easily Google for a list. If you've taken a course like medical terminology, then great! Review your old notes. Once you've covered that, move onto generic drug suffixes and their corresponding drug classes. Once you've done that, move on to memorizing generic and brand names. Do this in order; I think the results will be astounding. 

**5) Plan a career goal.** By now, you should be able to answer the question ""Why do you want to be a pharmacist?"" flawlessly. Make sure your reasons are completely honest and true. With that, research the job market; KNOW your strengths and KNOW your desires. In short, try to pinpoint what you really want to accomplish in life as a pharmacist, and create a simple long-term plan with steps of how to get you there. You obviously won't know for sure what you want to do until you get your hands dirty, but taking these first steps can do wonders. 


Now, I could add much more, but these are the primary things I'd focus on without getting overwhelmed. After all, this probably is your most free summer before school, so ENJOY IT! What do you guys think? If you have additional suggestions, feel free to comment. 


**EDIT:** Just to clarify, I'm not trying to ruin anyone's summer. I only post this because some students, no matter how sane they are, do ask this before school starts. With the exception of shadowing/working in #3, you can easily enjoy your summer. 1) Picking up a hobby won't buy into your relaxation time; it's supposed to be fun. And chances are, you already have one. 2) ""Network"" at parties, bars, or hangouts. Simply, meet people and talk. Make friends. 3) You don't need to shadow or work, but I would still encourage you to find an easily accessible and personal resource for questions. 4) You can do this in 5-10 minutes a day, or you can take care of it in one week. You'd still end up having at least 2 months to yourself. 5) Ok, I will be biased in this one because I believe a well balanced, happy life needs a sense of direction. This is not a homework assignment. Re-evaluate why you want to be a pharmacist because if you end up hating your job or not being satisfied with the pay, that will be a life long burden. You can find something related to pharmacy that will make you happy in the long-run; and if not, there is still time to refuse acceptance and re-plan your goals. Aside from all this, there is no doubt that you will have enough time to get wasted every weekend, to travel out of the country, to bond with friends one last time, or to pursue a new skill you never had time to master before. I had a 3 month summer before pharmacy school to do all of the above, and I could have done 1-5 easily during that time. I'm just providing some suggestions, but thanks for the input!"

I must warn you before reading my story that you might want to physically harm me because of how carelessly I have been raking up my debts, but you can trust me that I am absolutely ashamed to having to post this, I really do not know where to start and I have been looking for advice in all the wrong places (apparantly) for more than a year. 

**So this is my current situation** -&gt; 

----------------------

I get about 5-10 letters from debt agencies every week that amount only has been increasing in the last 2 years. My debts range from Health insurance, to tuition, rent and much more. In total this is about 8000 EURO. Next to that I am paying back a bank loan my mom co-signed on to pay of most of my debts about 2 years ago, which currently sits at 4000 Euro and my monthly payments are 100 Euro. 

I also have a student loan that currently sits at 12.000 Euro, but I won't have to start paying it back until I graduate in a year from now and then I will have 15 years to do so. 

I don't even feel like I have a basic understanding of money management. Since 2011 I have tried paying my debtors, but the debts come from 5 different angencies, and whenever something breaks down or when there are unforseen costs I get into other debts or break my monthly payment contract and they don't seem cool with that.

Somewhere summer last year it has gotten to the point where I become utterly depressed and suicidal about this whole situation, and since then I have stopped paying and responding to any debts that I have. The letters come and go right into the garbage can without even reading them. I know how stupid this is. But I cannot open these letters without losing a week of sleep and worrying about how I should be paying them or what kind of agreements I should and can make. It literally feels like freezing up and breaking down with depression again. 


------------------------------

What should I be doing? What should I be looking into? I don't own a car or much at all that I could sell. Its just my computer and clothes. Between having been homeless and addicted for years I never really had time for a lifestyle other than that. Perhaps it sounds strange but I really do not know where to start anymore. I currently get 730 Euro in Student Wellfare (only 230 Euro of that is a loan) and that is my only income. In exactly a week from now I will be starting my internship and will be paid another 400 Euro a month which will help. My rent is 380 a month. 

-------------

Any help is greatly appreciated. I am a hard worker and following my dreams, everything in life is finally going well and as planned, except my debts. Once i graduate I probably will have a job right away (I have been offered full time jobs already) and once I get a salary I do not want to start solving and understanding these problems much to late.

I received the title ""Legislative Aide"" while I was there. My internship lasted almost five months and then I was back to school to finish my degree.

I graduated in December with a degree in political science (minor in communications), and have yet to find another job. The place that I interned at never had the intention to hire me after my time was up (obviously they cycle the position for free work). Since I was new to the internship process, this is a piece of information that I wish I had known from the start.

So here I am - in the same boat as many people. I have applied to many different jobs, taken some temp work, and exhausted my entire contact list. I also know that no one owes me a thing and that I am not entitled to a job. I am just wondering what the next step is.

It seems like the job market is insanely competitive up here. For instance, I went to an informational interview with a Chief of Staff on the Hill. Before I spoke to her, there two people in front of me meeting with her. The first had a masters degree. The second had a JD. Both of these individuals were looking for a paying job because they were currently working for free at other organizations. (I know how difficult it is to get a job on the hill to begin with but the above example emphasizes my point perfectly)


While I would work for free if I could, I simply cannot afford to do so anymore. Everyone says networking, networking, networking, but the reality of the situation is that even with networking there is a bit of luck involved in it. I am now open to almost anything. I have been working with a temp agency but I would really like something that is long term. 

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Also, if anyone needs a recent political science grad with legislative experience feel free to PM me.


**EDIT**: Thank you all for the advice. I want to say again that I am not limited to just the political science field of work. In fact, I'm looking to get into the IT or PR field now.

17g5ew,1,2013-01-28,Is DC to competitive for a recent college grad?,[deleted],washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/17g5ew/is_dc_to_competitive_for_a_recent_college_grad/,"So I moved to DC last January to do an internship that was related to financial legislation. I received the title ""Legislative Aide"" while I was there. My internship lasted almost five months and then I was back to school to finish my degree.

I graduated in December with a degree in political science (minor in communications), and have yet to find another job. The place that I interned at never had the intention to hire me after my time was up (obviously they cycle the position for free work). Since I was new to the internship process, this is a piece of information that I wish I had known from the start.

So here I am - in the same boat as many people. I have applied to many different jobs, taken some temp work, and exhausted my entire contact list. I also know that no one owes me a thing and that I am not entitled to a job. I am just wondering what the next step is.

It seems like the job market is insanely competitive up here. For instance, I went to an informational interview with a Chief of Staff on the Hill. Before I spoke to her, there two people in front of me meeting with her. The first had a masters degree. The second had a JD. Both of these individuals were looking for a paying job because they were currently working for free at other organizations. (I know how difficult it is to get a job on the hill to begin with but the above example emphasizes my point perfectly)


While I would work for free if I could, I simply cannot afford to do so anymore. Everyone says networking, networking, networking, but the reality of the situation is that even with networking there is a bit of luck involved in it. I am now open to almost anything. I have been working with a temp agency but I would really like something that is long term. 

Is there hope for the many people that are in the same situation as me? Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. 



Also, if someone needs a recent graduate with legislative experience feel free to PM me.

I'm studying Business Administration with a Finance concentration at a top 10 business school and I haven't learned anything of technical value to this point besides two classes: Corporate Finance and Business Communications.

I'm currently abroad in a business program for an entire year and the internship search has come up empty (thinking about just spending the summer in Africa doing education or aid work at this point). If I could redo it all I'd do a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Economics. However, it's too late in my four years to turn back so I need to look ahead. 

What are the best options available for further schooling? Would it be a waste to go back for the double Bachelor's if I can get a scholarship? Would I be accepted straight into a Master's program if I applied next year?

17fxt9,5,2013-01-28,Game Night Carpetball : My post mortem/rant,AgeNtNicK,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/17fxt9/game_night_carpetball_my_post_mortemrant/,"A few weeks after my first game came out on Google Play, I have thought of a few things I would definitely share with you game designers out there so you wouldn't make any mistakes in your forth coming games.

My girlfriend and I both worked on making this game. We started working on it around July 2012 and had some errors midway which delayed it past our original December release window.

First off, my game [Game Night Carpetball is available to download here.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.treemonstergames.carpetball) We are working on getting a iOS version out asap. Which brings me to our first obstacle. After upon releasing the game we found out that most of our friends and family have iPhones, iPods and iPads. Now for me that's fine since I own an iPod but Unity requires you to build on a mac to create the files for transfer. And as we all know mac's cost a lot of money!

At the very beginning of the game process, our prototype was basically our multiplayer mode. And truth be it, that is all it was going to be. We had plans to have a AI controlled enemy that you can play against but that was scrapped after planning stages. What made us change our minds was a marketing company I had an internship at told us that we need to incorporate a currency for players to want to collect and purchase by any means. So we decided to do a campaign of sorts that we have now.

One of our big delays was this marketing company. We had been meeting with them for months and when we were ready for them they totally ignored us. Now I know they are busy since they're business grew a lot the past year, but we decided to go without them. They were going to spend $3,000 on us to promote the app and we were going to have to pay them back eventually. Now not that I don't have faith in myself, but I knew that this phone game was not going to make $3,000.

Before we decided to go without the marketing company we had our storefront in our game all complete with all the storage of currency and progress within Unity. They told us that we could use they're game platform (able to make a storefront easily, being able to change prices on the fly, manage currency through a database) that they were developing for Unity and it turns out it wasn't complete. We decided to not use the marketing company but we still decided to use the platform. By the time we needed to release the game, they still have not finished it so we decided to keep our storefront.


My lessons I learned:


**If you are thinking of using a marketing company, think ahead of time** - I can't stress this enough now. Show them a prototype to see if they're on board for it but don't wait until last minute.

**Don't make a store until you know your not using a platform** - We were frustrated when we were planning on scrapping our storefront since it was all there already and working. Makeshift stores work fine.

**Playtest, playtest, playtest** - One thing we had trouble was getting playtesters. I have learned to make a web version and send it around so people can playtest over the web.. after we finished the game. 

I just wanted to share my experience with my first released game.

17fwc0,27,2013-01-28,Sometimes They Crawl Back...,MyNeihborTim,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17fwc0/sometimes_they_crawl_back/,"Kara didn’t know what to make of it. In fact, she thought she might be going crazy. 

But the fact that Sebastian was back, lounging on the couch, and purring away was enough to make her either laugh hysterically or start screaming at the top of her lungs.


Sebastian had been dead for over three months.

And now he was here, licking his dirt mottled hair, as the exposed tendons and bone from one of his ravaged paws lay stretched out on the couch – leaving behind a dusty residue on the black leather.
Kara opened up the blinds and let the sun peek through, the shaft of yellow-white light crisscrossed Sebastian’s body, as the cat, with only one milky white eye left, curled the remainder of its tail and meowed.

The meow came out as a gurgle – but it was a meow just the same.

Her cat was back, and Kara didn’t know what to make of it.

Three months earlier, when Sebastian had entered his eighteenth year, she knew that their remaining time would be short. Of course, she had no idea how short this time would be.

Two days after Sebastian’s birthday on April 15th – the cat had left his usual sleeping spot (under the bed) and jumped onto Kara sometime after four in the morning.

The cat was having trouble breathing and the sound of the harsh respiration woke Kara from a deep sleep.

She had enough time to turn on the light, and watch as Sebastian rolled over on his side, take one more breath and then the cat was gone.

Kara was heart-broken; Sebastian had been with her through so much.

When Kara first came to Los Angeles, in hopes of becoming a radio DJ, she had found the city to be an incredible tide of loneliness. People lived in a bubble, whether it was in their apartments, or cars - Kara noted that she could go for weeks without talking to a single person.

Being from the Midwest, she had never experienced a place where the defense mechanisms of millions of people could have the unpleasant after-effect of repelling all human interaction.

You could eat in silence, sleep in silence, travel in silence and work in silence – depending on where you were employed.

And for Kara, who had been very outgoing in college, this level of silence was not just overwhelming, but incredibly debilitating.

It was at her mother’s urging that Kara decided to get a cat.  

At first, she thought adopting an older cat would the best way to go. Nobody wants to adopt an older cat, and Kara wanted to improve the life of a pet, a life that may be taken away by an injection or gas.
She had chosen a larger, orange tabby that she named, Gremlin.

He was a pleasant, if not cranky, old sot – but he was low maintenance, had a good disposition and knew how to use a litter box.

But Gremlin wasn’t destined for a long life with his new owner. After returning from work as an intern at a popular radio station, Kara found Gremlin lifeless and stiff on her bathroom floor.

Picking up the cat was the hardest part. There was something so alien about a once malleable and cuddly ball of fur, which now dead, was stretched out – and felt like a heavy stuffed animal.

Kara wasn’t very squeamish, and although it really bothered her, she scooped the cat in to a plastic bag and dumped him unceremoniously into the trash.

She didn’t have a yard in her apartment complex, and the last thing she wanted was her neighbors or landlord to see her burying her tabby in a space reserved water-resistant succulents.

It also bothered her that Gremlin had decided to go out on a Wednesday, which meant the refuse pick up wouldn’t happen till the following week. And she had to ignore the smattering of comments from other neighbors about that “horrible trash smell.”

If she ever got another cat, she would bury it – even if it meant she had to abscond to the park in the middle of the night.

Kara was not dissuaded from adopting another cat, but having an older one would not do. She decided that a kitten would probably have the best chance for both parties.

It was a Sunday, nearly two and a half weeks after Gremlin passed, that she met Sebastian at a Pet Smart on Pico blvd.

He was the runt of the litter, incredibly vocal, and down right ornery. But she loved him from the second she filled out the paperwork.

This particular cat just felt right and she believed that Gremlin had only served as a dress rehearsal.

Sebastian flourished in his new home, and made it apparent that he would rule this house and not the other way around.

And thus the friendship between the two bloomed.

And as the year passed, Kara rose in the ranks. Starting with her internship, to answering calls, to producing shows and finally becoming a host – Sebastian was there every step of the way.

He wasn’t fond of the various boyfriends that Kara brought home over the years, and being that she was committed to her work more than relationships, Sebastian seemed to be fine with that.

Though, Sebastian would make himself known if he didn’t like a certain guy that Kara was spending her time with. More than once, Sebastian would take a pee on his favorite leather jacket, or abscond with his keys.

He was a little shit, but he was Kara’s little shit and she wouldn’t have it any other way.

Kara often wondered on those many nights when Sebastian would lie on her chest, and stare at with half-closed eyes, purring – if they had known each other in another life?

There was this deep soul connection between the two of them.

Were they lovers in the past? Were they mother and child? Was it the other way around?

The bond between the two was almost telepathic – for there were times when she was feeling anxious or upset, that Sebastian would gravitate towards her and plop himself into the middle of her lap.

When Kara was chosen as a DJ for one of LA’s biggest alternative-rock stations, her excitement must have been transported across town. When she returned home from winning the gig, and a celebratory drink with friends – her apartment was in shambles.

No, there hadn’t been an earthquake and it most certainly wasn’t a robbery.

Pictures, vases, drink coasters, pillows, half-full water glasses and plants had been knocked to the floor.
At first Kara thought it was an earthquake, but that seismic output was the cat that was running from room to room like a wild man.

He was a leaping, twirling ball of fur that shot out from the bathroom, blazing through the hallway into the living room – sliding across the coffee table, scattering the remaining magazines and remote control and then jumping effortlessly to the top of Kara’s head, where he sat, like a Russian hat, and meowed.

Kara could only laugh – yes, they would now be able to afford a house. At the mere thought of this, Sebastian jumped from her head and landed on the recliner, and flopped over, and began to groom his chest.

And here he was now, grooming himself – even though patches of his fur were gone, his skin, covered in mud and the muscles and internal organs clearly visible underneath.

When Sebastian died, Kara had made good on her promise and dug a very deep hole next to the rosemary bush.

Sebastian loved to rub himself against the rosemary, and it gave him such a sweet scent when he was in the house, that the plant was a constant reminder of him.

It was only fitting that his final resting place should be there.

There would be no more adoptions of other cats. Not for a while at least.

Kara planned to travel – since a soulless corporation purchased the radio station. The new owners believed that radio DJ’s should be replaced by an iPod, with the voice tracking done a world away.
For the first time in Kara’s life – she was free.

And having booked her trip to Europe, Kara was now having trouble sleeping. Always such a sound sleeper before, insomnia was something new for her.

Maybe it was the excitement of heading into the great unknown? Or maybe now that Sebastian was gone threw off her biological rhythms.

Strange dreams plagued her; dreams about suffocating, dreams about being stuck in a corner. The lack of sleep wreaked havoc on her blood pressure and diet. She found that she was forgetting things, and isolating herself.

Kara felt unmotivated, uninspired, and for the first time in a long, long time – lonely.

That LA bubble was making itself known again, and one day she realized that she hadn’t said a word out loud in twenty-four hours.

So it was one night, three months after Sebastian had passed, when she woke from another bad dream, where she felt like she was losing her mind that she got up and walked out to Sebastian’s grave, and cried.

She hadn’t cried when he died, in fact her own stoic sense of “this is the circle of life” kept her from any emotional outpour.

Shaking off the dream that she could no longer remember, she walked outside to the rosemary bush, and sat down – where it all came out.

It felt good to cry, and better to accept that she missed her old friend.

She slept soundlessly after that.

And the next morning, when she was brewing a cup of coffee, she heard a tapping on the sliding glass door.

She had screamed when she saw him.

Sebastian tapped on the window with a skeletal paw.

He tapped again.

And then he gurgled – and she couldn’t stop herself – she was moving quickly to the door.

Sebastian walked in and made a figure eight around her legs – rubbing his rotted fur against her ankles.
And that’s when Kara fainted.

But he was there when she awoke and he has been there ever since.

And now here he was grooming himself and Kara didn’t feel so scared anymore, because she wasn’t the only one who was experiencing this.

Shortly after Sebastian appeared, there were other reports of pet owners who were experiencing visitations from old friends.

The same morning Sebastian crawled back, she heard her next door neighbor scream “Why? Oh my God! Why?”

His long-dead Labrador retriever named, Bud, had crawled out of the ground and wanted to play ball with his master.

Bud was only a skeleton now, no fur, muscles, eyes or ears – but somehow his bones stayed together, and as Bud ran, the dog’s phalanges scraped along the ground with a puppy’s glee.

Around the neighborhood, people were reporting that their dogs, hamsters, parrots and cats were coming back from the dead.

If they had maintained some semblance of their bodies, they were soon poking their snouts out of the ground.

Some wondered if heaven was full? 

And others said that these returning animals didn’t have souls and were merely being reanimated by some new type of bacteria.

But none of it mattered to Kara, who finally had her Sebastian back.

She’d have to get used to the smell, though.

Sebastian smelled awful, as did all of the reanimated pets.

But everyone would have to get used to it, because sometimes they crawl back, and Kara wouldn’t have it any other way.

Advice?,[deleted],ask,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/17ftt4/im_a_junior_in_college_and_not_at_all_where_i/,"Like I said, I'm a junior at a public liberal arts university. I'm studying Business Administration with a Finance concentration at a top 10 business school and I haven't learned anything of technical value to this point besides two classes: Corporate Finance and Business Communications. My dad is an accountant and always told me a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering with an MBA would be more valuable than a Bachelor's in Business Administration and I think he was right.

I'm currently abroad in a business program for an entire year and the internship search has come up empty (thinking about just spending the summer in Africa doing education or aid work at this point). If I could redo it all I'd do a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Economics. However, it's too late in my four years to turn back so I need to look ahead. What are the best options available for further schooling? 

Would it be a waste to go back for the double Bachelor's if I can get a scholarship? Would I be accepted straight into a Master's program if I applied next year? I realize I don't have it that bad and I'm not looking for sympathy saying my life's fallen to pieces; just helpful advice so I can get rid of this lost feeling and be proactive again.

I've always been overweight, but by the tail end of high school I started to even out and had lowered my weight down to about [210lbs](http://i.imgur.com/xxvioVj.jpg). But alas, college struck and I gorged on dorm food and gained a bunch of weight, hovering between 225-250lbs. I tried to exercise but nothing really happened other than keeping my weight in check a little.

 I had my wake-up call during Christmas of 2011 when I stepped on a scale and saw 265lbs, my [highest adult weight](http://i.imgur.com/D1xQ6Ao.jpg). I decided I needed to do something, so I tried to dedicate myself to the gym at least 4 days a week and eat less/healthier. I also started using myfitnesspal, but it was always kind of an afterthought and I didn't take it serious. By the time summer rolled around I was down to 245lbs, but kind of plateaued until I started my summer internship and got back into a gym routine. I invested into some backpacking equipment and was trying to push myself to get outside and be more active.

By the end of summer I was about [230lbs](http://i.imgur.com/dluOfF7.jpg), and after getting back to school I kind of stuck there until a little before Thanksgiving when I decided to crack down on myself. I started to realize that every day I don't exercise is another day I'm going to stay the same weight. Every piece of pizza I eat isn't going to improve my confidence or make my pants fit better. I also started using myfitnesspal a lot more seriously. A week before Christmas I was 218lbs, but ended up back to 225 by New Year's Day after the holiday gorging. I joined the hoard of /r/loseit users on myfitnesspal and that helped kick me into an overdrive. I'm sticking to a healthy diet and I try to get at least an hour of cardio in every day (Netflix + my gym's new wifi = my best friend). I'm in my final blow-off semester of college and I'm also taking 6 PE classes just to fill my time. Between the exercise, diet, and all of the amazing/encouraging redditors on myfitnesspal, I'm now officially my lowest adult weight.

Now I can finally fit into my favorite [shirt](http://i.imgur.com/btlH0Av.jpg)! (which never really fit when I got it a few years ago)

What should I do? I'm genuinely seeking advice here. 

An older (about 14 yrs older), very wealthy man has offered me $2500 for sex, for several sessions over the next two weeks and I'm conflicted as to whether or not I should accept his offer.
I'm a young, attractive female and aspiring creative in a major city. I'm also desperately poor and I'm about to lose my apartment and the close friend I rent it from due to financial destitution. I had to drop out of college, with just two semesters remaining, due to lack of money, which means my best-paying options right now are in food service.

I lost my pervious serving job in October because I started a very prestigious internship in my career field. I gave up my paying job without a second thought because the internship was was such a huge opportunity, and I had enough savings that I figured I had a few months to find a new service position. I didn't have any time to look, however, and had no luck when applying. I just landed a new service position but I don't start for two more weeks. At this point I'm so deep in the hole and terrified that I can't climb out without a miracle. So many problems in my life would be solved if I could just get my finances in order, and this ""older man"" can make all these problems disappear in an instant.

I want to just go for it, but I'm scared of how it will affect my emotional health. I was raped when I was 20 (two years ago) and sex and intimacy have at times been challenging. I've only slept with one guy before, in college my only long-term boyfriend, and I've only ""fooled around"" with a handful more. I'm scared that doing this will complicate my sex life even further and create an even greater barrier to intimacy. I'm also afraid of someone finding out, or that he may have diseases (though he said he show me test results), or that he might use the money to coerce me into something I'm not comfortable with.

I'm nervous that the rather coercive nature of this type of relationship will trigger the feelings from my rape and trigger a similar deep depression. But then again, it might not, and I could REALLY use the money. I'm very happy these days and I have a great support network of friends, and though they have no money to lend and I would never tell them about this explicitly, I wouldn't feel alone like I did when I was raped. This could even be fun! He appeared to be a nice guy when we met in person, and he seems to respect me as more than an object (I don't find him attractive at all however, which makes me uncomfortable.) I'm a confident person and I've always wanted to own my sexuality - part of the reason sex is still tough for me is because I avoid it completely. Maybe this could be therapeutic?
I'm so conflicted. Literally 50/50 for or against. I'm meeting him this week, and if I decline then the offer will be permanently off the table. Anyone have any advice?"

Hugs.  You did your best.  Right now, while the rational part of your brain knew all along that it was probably gonna end, that's cold comfort to the emotional part of you, the part of you that worked so damn hard to make it work.

You're likely in a puddle on the bedroom floor right now, having cut class or the internship; it's all good, man, let it out.  Right now, there's nothing else you can compare these feelings to except for when Dad died.  It's all good, dude, you really, *really* loved her, like no other woman.  And that's okay.

Three-and-a-half months from now, it'll all be gravy, dude.  Yeah, she's still the first thing that I think of when I get up in the morning, but it's just merely annoying now, not this crushing burden that you're dealing with.

You, duggo, need to know that your opinion of her is about to drop.  Her behavior in the next few weeks, taken into consideration with the hoops she had no problem making you jump through during in the relationship, will leave her as someone you're just unimpressed by.  Yes, the me *now* totally remembers the good times, but they've *been* over.  Oh, and she's about to piss off our cousin ""Fay"".  Forgive her for it.  The relationship's over.

Another big thing you *need* to know:  she *left* you, and that means you now owe her nothing; stop worrying about her, because you have only yourself to worry about now.  You'll be taking good care of yourself in the coming weeks.  I'm proud of you, man; you make me proud of myself.

And good on ya for cutting out the alcohol during the most intense part of all this!  And for exercising a lot.  You'll soon come to recognize in hindsight why this was so important.

Spoiler alert duggo!  Your intern evals are gonna be solid, your grades will actually improve, you're gonna be in pretty badass shape soon, you're gonna get your garden up and going again, and ""Darren"" is gonna ask you to work the film festival red carpet and you're gonna interview celebrities!  You'll get to where I'm at soon enough, but like boot camp, it'll get better but it's about to get worse.  The insomnia and the heartache are the worst.

**EDIT:**  You're gonna ruin the song ""Breathe Me"" by Sia for both of us.

**EDIT:**  People!  Don't be hard on yourselves because you're not doing everything ""perfectly."" You're operating at a reduced capacity!

Yes, I've been taking care of myself and generally improving everything since the breakup, but know that I did go through a couple of two-week phases where I just didn't give a shit.

I did a five-mile standup paddle race a week into my vacation, and after that, I let myself goooooooo.

I wasn't trying to impress anyone, and enjoyed not having to. I was single (still am), and *enjoying* it.  To me, those empty beer cans, pizza boxes and ice cream containers in my room were decorations commemorating how few fucks I gave. *And it was nice.*

Batteries: recharged.  I'm back in school, and back on the healthy, fit, responsible wagon now.  And my room's clean.

I regret nothing."
17f0zo,16,2013-01-28,Amazing grace (getting something good off my chest),OneHasLepers,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17f0zo/amazing_grace_getting_something_good_off_my_chest/,"Today in church we sang Amazing Grace.  This wasn't any surprise to me; as the intern pastor, I've been choosing all the music.

What totally surprised me is what our worship leader added to it.  Normally, we just go straight into the song.  Today, she started talking about her grandmother, and her grandmother's willingness to welcome everyone, and how her grandmother taught her this song.  She said that probably everyone in the room had a story to go along with this song, and encouraged us to think about it while we sang.

Part of me was a little disapproving of this kind of interlude -- we'd just had the sermon, which was really good, and I felt like this sudden veer into ""remember the good times you've had with this old hymn!"" was a distraction.  But, this is what happens at our church:  we offer what we've got, and sometimes it means something to someone else.  It's one of the many reasons I love being there.

The thing that knocked me completely for a loop was that I remembered something I'd forgotten for years:

*I sang Amazing Grace the night I tried to kill myself.*

It was ten and a half years ago.  I was 17.  I was gay, and almost too smart for school, and the girl I thought I loved was so very straight, and I felt so very alone.  And I was starting to realize that while my family and my congregation did not care that I was gay, the wider church and the whole world definitely did.  I had thought I was called to be a pastor.  How was I going to find a way to do that?

I OD'd on painkillers -- some brand of Tylenol.  I remember laying down on the bathroom floor, listening to my father drinking and watching TV in the room down the hall, and thinking about how much I did not want to die, and yet I didn't have the energy to get up.

To this day, I don't know what got me on my feet.  But I somehow got out the door, and talked to my dad, and he yelled for my mom, and they got me into the car.

It was really dark out, and Mom was driving, and my dad was near tears.  Mom was terrified; I don't know how she managed to drive.  They asked me to talk on the way, so that they'd know I was still awake.  We all knew if I fell asleep, I'd be dead.

I didn't know what to say, so my dad said, ""Sing.""  And Amazing Grace is what came out of my mouth.

*Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me*

It was ridiculously ironic, of course.  I wonder now if it put a bitter taste in my parents' throat, to hear those words out of the mouth of their only daughter who was trying to live after she'd tried to die.

*I once was lost, but now am found; was blind, but now I see*

I kept singing, all the way.  God, I can feel my stomach clenching as I write this.  I was so scared.  I so badly wanted to live.

*Through many dangers, toils, and snares, I have already come*

We got to the hospital.  I got neutralizer, and a stomach pump (*horrible* experience), and an IV, and potassium pills because I'd dehydrated myself.  I was put on 72-hour hold until a psychiatrist could see me.

*'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home*

I did die that night, in a way.  The part of me that wanted to die.  The part of me that thought I would feel better if I didn't hurt any more; the part of me that thought the only way to change my life was to end it.

*The Lord has promised good to me; his word my hope secures*

But the rest of me lived.  My mind, and my heart, and the best parts of myself made it through.  I got serious about fighting my depression and anxiety.  I let go of the girl I thought I loved.  I focused on the things that made me happy:  classes I liked, a church where I felt welcome, music that made me feel at peace.

I went to college.  I made new friends, who loved me, who challenged me, who called me out of the darkness whenever I was less myself.  

I started studying religion.  I met the woman who would become my partner.

I graduated.  Got a good job.  Got an apartment with my girlfriend.  Got a cat.  Found a new church, where we were welcomed just as we were.  

Got scholarships to seminary.  Got all A's my first semester.  Got more friends, who loved me and my partner and welcomed us into their churches.  Got an internship where I am loved and supported.

I got my life.

*He will my shield and portion be as long as life endures*

It's not always easy.  I chose to follow a call into a profession where I have to daily argue for my right to exist.  But I get to be with people when they are open, and loving, and broken, and vulnerable, and *damn* it is a good life.

Ten and a half years ago, I had no idea just how much my life could get better.  I'm so glad I found out.

**To all my fellow Redditors:  I wish you peace.  I wish you love.  I wish you everything you need.  I wish you, in whatever form you need it, amazing grace.**"

* On the internship I'm doing now, I've had a hard time putting what I've done onto paper. Honestly, while it's called a ""programming"" internship, we don't get to do a whole lot of programming. I'd say 80% of it is composition and maintenance, and 20% of it is coding. It's a company that sends out large mailings for clients (stuff like bills, newsletters, etc) and we work on composing the letter and mapping out various variables in them. The framework is all there, so the most coding I get to do is various scripts that help glue together certain aspects or extract data here and there. Does what I put there reflect that at all, or can anybody recommend something different to place there?

* On the tech support positions, should I put both like that, or lump them into one? I kind of like having both, as it shows that I got a promotion and the extra responsibility I had as second line. Also, I realize there's likely way too much in there. Recommendations on anything I can cut out?

* For school, my GPA ain't great. It's at about a 3.1 right now. (Although, it should be much better after this semester. A combination of getting diagnosed with T1 diabetes last semester as well as a hectic work schedule resulted in me failing a few classes that I'm now retaking.) Is it fine to leave the GPA off? As for graduation, it will likely be May 2015, but I'm hoping for Dec 2014 if I can take enough classes per semester. Would it benefit me to put my graduation date a semester earlier, even if I'm not 100% sure if I'll make it?

* Projects: do the projects listed seem well put or relevant? Honestly, I've never completely finished a huge project (although I've got one or two in the works right now). Hopefully the ones I've included are relevant, and show some programming initiative/skill. Also, should I include ""current projects""? For example, the Arduino robot is something that's been sitting on the side for quite some time and isn't far along at all. Should I even include that?

* Online classes: I've learned a TON from these, and loved taking them. I assume it wouldn't hurt me to include these, as I think it shows a passion for programming, as well as experience and work outside of school and my personal projects.

* Languages: HTML/CSS/XML - include or not? I know they're not programming languages, which is why I just called the section ""Current Languages"". Should I include stuff like experience with SVN/Git/Mercurial, or just stick to languages? Also, is it a good idea to have a section of ""Currently Learning"" or something like that I pretty much know very little about, but am starting to learn/experiment with?

Sorry for all the questions. I don't expect anyone to answer all of them! But if anybody is able to take a look at the resume and give me a coupla recommendations, that would be much appreciated!"

I have recently been informed of the opportunity for me to get a big time internship in Qatar.  My dad told me today that they will most likely do a hair test to test me for drugs.  Since this is a conservative Arabic country as well as my first step in the business world i don't want to mess this up.  I have been smoking marijuana 1-3 times a day since the beginning of September with a few 1-10 day breaks in there as well.  

I know that marijuana usually appears in urine tests for 3-30 days depending on the amount you smoke, your metabolism etc etc.  I'm trying to find out how long will marijuana show up in a drug test using my hair?  Is it the same as a urine test or is it a much larger range?  My dad said he thought it was 90 days, in which case ill need to stop ASAP.  

Thanks for the help, frients."

I have a friend, let's call her Emma, who I have been friends with for a very long time. Our mothers are close friends, and I get along great with her mom as well. Several months ago, back in August, Emma's mom recommended me for a really good graphic design job. Not an internship, but on the level of really laid-back freelance work. This has been a great job for me, both in work experience and making connections, not to mention I get paid!! 

The problem: I never expressly thanked Emmas mom for this job, except when I saw her around town one day and I very emphatically thanked her for recommending me. I feel so guilty because I know I should have written her a card or gotten her a gift card or something nice as a thank-you for the recommendation, just so she knows how much I appreciate it. 

When I first got the job, I was insanely busy, with a 15-hour-a-week part-time job, starting college as a full-time student, and recovering from a major surgery. I realize that none of that is any excuse for not sitting down and writing a thank you card and picking up a gift card or something, but those are my reasons. 

So is it too late? I would still like to thank her in some way, but I don't know how at this point, and I'm very embarrassed. If anyone has any ideas of how I could approach this to her, I would be so grateful.

 I am very sorry if this is confusing or rambling, I am not a writer! Thank you XX!"

17emiy,0,2013-01-27,Thinking of transferring out of Tech.,ColdCaulkCraig,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/17emiy/thinking_of_transferring_out_of_tech/,"The following paragraphs are a quote from a post I found in another thread. I'm posting this because it describes exactly how I feel:

I know this is an old thread, but I wanted to respond since I go to Tech. I'm a senior ISyE major (used to be CmpE) at Tech, and I have always regretted going here. In Georgia, you pretty much have 2 choices for tradtional colleges: UGA for liberal arts, and GT for engineering. There's also Emory and some other small colleges, but UGA and GT are the most popular. If you want to do engineering and you don't have money to go out of state, then you are stuck with Tech (or Southern Polytechnic, which is horrible). 

It's true that Tech has ""great"" academic programs. The reason why they are highly regarded is not because of the professors or facilities or anything like that. It's basically because Tech is so difficult that it teaches students how to solve problems on their own with little or no help. Tech students are pretty much thrown in the water and it's up to them not to drown; if you survive, then you will have skills to be a hard worker in a job. You will learn to be a good worker if you go here; I've worked for Disney as an intern and found it to be quite easy compared with school. 

What Tech lacks the most is a social life. If you like programming and talking about computers 24/7, you will like it here. If you would rather play videogames than anything else with your freetime, you will like it here. If you are socially inept and awkward, you will fit in well. There are 27% girls here last I checked, and out of those, a small percentage are ""normal,"" and a small percentage of that are attractive (physically and otherwise). It's not just girls either, the guys are also strange. It's hard for me to make friends here because I don't like many of the people, and I was even considered nerdy in high school. If academics are your main concern, Tech would be great for you. If you want to have some kind of life or enjoy college the way most people do, you will hate your existence while you are at Tech. 

This is a little off-topic, but I am actually taking a philosophy class here that shows how schools (among other sources) shape people to want money and to buy stuff, and how institutions like Tech are used to create people who are hard workers and are primarily concerned with consumption of products. Over the years I've thought about my life more and more, and really thought about why I chose this school and what I really want my life to be like. I picked CmpE in the beginning because I thought I liked computers and that major makes a lot of money. A lot of people pick schools because they want to be proud of their accomplishments, they want prestige, and mostly, they want to get that degree so they can make a lot of money and buy a lot of stuff. Recently I've realized that I don't find that moving to the suburbs, working 60+ hours a week, and buying a lot of products is the life I want, but that's what you are typically headed for with an engineering degree. 

Anyway, if you want to go here so you can get a good job that pays a lot of money so you can buy more TVs and an expensive car and whatever, then go for it. Personally, I wish I had looked for something I would actually be interested in rather than what is highly-rated or is known for making a lot of money. I also would have rather spent these years enjoying my life as well as earning a degree instead of spending it in constant depression at Tech."

I am quite poor with around 35k student debt with little to no savings, and on-and-off min wage income. He is upper middle class with no debt some savings but also no income as he's a student. Neither of us have any assets-- not even a car. Neither of us have credit history, just extensive rental histories with wonderful feed back thus people love to rent to us. We have three accounts with one bring shared but only in his name (only like 20 $ in that account now).

We plan on getting married in a year and a half. In that time i'd have grained ~10k more debt (all fafsa government student loans). He'll have a car in his name that I'd never drive because idk how to as no one ever taught me. Neither of us will have credit cards (google riba in islam) though. He will have typical software engineer job for ~6 months by then too. We'd be signing our living together lease jointly after marriage (again religion thing). Ill be finishing an internship and looking for a job or entering grad school.

So no assets. No idea of what our income will be etc. Also google tells me they cost 2.5k--- our whole wedding budget is 3k, not a penny more. Also I'd have to pay for half of this prenupt yet the lawyer only represent him so we gotta pretend partner is paying for it all. Ugh. We're also not having kids-vestecomey woo.

So reddit... why the fuck do we need this?!?!?! It seems like a big waste. That I'm tossing my few savinfs away for lawyer shit and It's just gunna result in us not being able to afford beyond 10min ceremony in the backyard wedding. Both Our families are also gunna freak out since they're very conservative Muslim and italian Catholics. :(

Please someone explain. No one where I grew up aka poorville ever did this so I got no one to ask.

Ps-- my student debt will be paid off before the wedding. Grandpa saved up for me. :) yay family :)

**tl/dr**

Girlfriend brought up prenupt because of post on here and boyfriend wants it. Girlfriend will sign because it's just another paper and dont csre much. Girlfriend now worried about cost of it (nearly all our wedding budget), and would like to know why this is worth it. Thanks."

She was with what I thought to be her boyfriend (turned out to be her brother) and her mom so I didn't make any effort to talk to her in the station. I did however exchange a look and make eye contact. Yes she dropped her eyes first. I purposefully got in line to board behind her so I could sit with her. I walked up behind her after she sat down and asked if I could sit with her. She happily agreed and we started talking. It turned out that we actually go to the same college and we bantered talked blah blah blah for an hour and then I had to get off at my stop. I got her number, we agreed that we should hang out at school. I should also mention that I'm currently on an internship and am not at school so I figured it was going to be a while till I had the chance to see her. I did tell her this. I think we exchanged some messages and snap chats after that, but I don't remember.

I don't really know how to initiate communication with out being creepy and I have no clue if she even remembers me. Should I assume that everything that previously occured on the train i.e. kino, attraction, comfort needs to be ignored?After reading seddit for some time now I know that text game is not usually beneficial but I need to remind her that I'm cool funny witty blah blah blah so I can get her interested again. What should I do? Any one ever had this situation before? 

Am I crazy or do I really have no chance?"

[Who is funnier in real life. Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g1wy?context=5)|Hard to say since they are both trappist monks who never speak off camera.

(you read that like richard gere in ""officer and a gentleman"", right?)  if i was doing comedy, or ""doing show business"" as you say, i would undoubtedly be chasing people down in home depot and promising to renovate their bathrooms. total no-brainer.

[For the interviews, how much of the book/ movie in question has Jon read? Is there someone whose job it is to read the book and give Jon some interesting questions to ask?

If so, who has been your favorite to meet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g0yv?context=5)|Jon is very prepared for ALL the interviews. we help a little, but i honestly don't know how he does it. interviews aren't rehearsed. we're discouraged from asking to meet the guests because it would just get out of hand, but i asked to meet joe montana (many years ago) and jerry rice (when he did dancing with the stars) because i grew up in the bay area in the 80's and was a HUGE fan.  GO NINERS!!!

[Whats the best stuff that never aired or an idea of yours that got scrapped that you would like to share? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fpjt?context=5)|We only really cover 1 or 2 stories a day so ideas get cut ALL the time simply because there's no time for them. it's just a matter of making choices. most recently, i really wanted to cover the recent developments in redistricting and the awarding of electoral votes but other stories trumped it. but that doesn't mean we won't address this issue later. and by that time i will, of course, have become a noted expert on the subject.
[Do you watch fox news all day looking for material? I am honestly amazed at how witty and thoughtful some of the smallest jokes on the daily show can be...Something that will take me a month to come up with you guys do daily..its truly amazing.

[Did you ever worry that Romney would be President?

[What is the best little-known fact about Jon that you can tell us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gj4v?context=5)|He wears almost the exact same ""outfit"" to work everyday - khakis, a gray t-shirt over a white long sleeve waffle shirt, and extremely well-worn doc martin boots.
[How much media--books, news, stuff on the Internet--do you have to *consume* on a daily or weekly basis in order to stay relevant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84ga0h?context=5)|It's not like there's a set amount. in other words my answer isn't ""296 pages"". we all just consume what we're capable of consuming in a given amount of time... which is just one of the things working at the daily show has in common with competing in a hot dog eating contest.
[What was it like working with Craig Kilborn? I hear he wasn't easy to work with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g8gl?context=5)|That depends on who you are i guess. i don't know ANYBODY who gets along with EVERYBODY. i liked craig. he was cool to me and he totally helped us get the show off the ground. he was also very easy to write for since he wasn't a big script doctor. (understatement) we used to get a lot of stuff on verbatim back then but if you go back and look at some of it it honestly could probably have done with a bit of massaging.
[HOW did you get into comedy writing? What made the daily show choose you? What would you tell someone who wants to do EXACTLY what you do?

[This is really great - thanks so much for doing this. I'm trying to gain a foothold as a comedic writer/storyteller as well, and this is fascinating. I saw you do a set at Kabin shortly before Christmas, too, and I was really impressed by how well you handled a heckler who turned out to be a mentally ill, possibly homeless person. You did it with grace and compassion, but without taking any shit.  I've always wondered: when a writer ""submits"" to a TV show, whether it's the Daily Show or Colbert or Totally Biased - what do they submit, exactly? What exactly goes into a ""packet?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c8540ac?context=5)|Wow! that kabin gig was totally unexpected. i wasn't ""on the show"", i just walked in and they put me on, which was nice but it caught me by surprise a bit. then the weird guy caught me by surprise. then the friend i hadn't seen for years but suddenly was seeing everywhere ALSO caught me by surprise. quite a night. thanks for the kind words. for answers to your questions i can honestly recommend listening to my podcast - i address this in almost every episode.

[How did you get started as a writer? Was it all from standup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fqw7?context=5)|This is a long answer but if you're really interested my full story is on this podcast (not my own podcast) that i did with a friend - [Link to bit.ly](http://bit.ly/Vjca5s)

[Well honestly people are people, and this guy makes jokes. You can't just change him without ruining his thought process to fit the mold you give him, which would really bring down the actual depth and quality of his answers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84i8oy?context=5)|Right on brother!

[I'm sure this is at least part of the answer, and it's pretty much what I always assumed.

What if this all wasn't real,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/17ecbs/just_a_thought_at_an_7_what_if_this_all_wasnt_real/,"So I was just philosophising about life and this thought came to mind again, a theory I have had for many years.


What if, all this, was just planned for me? That it would seem like I have controll over my life but everything was just planned out from the start. That the fact that I was born in 1992 was just made up for me, to live my life by. That I have one brother, and my parents got divorced. What if everything around me was all planned out. And every person I will ever meet is there for a reason, just there to teach me something in life and when I'm not with them they just won't be there. I'm now in my room, maybe the whole outside world isn't there anymore, because I'm not there at the moment. That if I leave a friend he just kinda freezes, and is busy in the mean time giving me a next piece of 'information' like trough twitter or Facebook. All specifically for me. All the things that have happend in my life, losses, loves and break ups are all planned. Getting new stuff like a guitar, or maybe a job or internship. Do you guys get what I'm getting at?

I don't know. "

A little bit about my history and myself. I live in eastern Canada, 29yrs old, female, I live with my mother (totally different story there all together) Within the past two years I have gone from clearing all my debts too barely even being able to afford milk. 

Here's what been happening:

I graduated from a graphic design course in Feb of last year. That resulted in a 15,000$ student loan. I decided that I would start a freelance business over the summer through a $3000 SEED grant. (I have 15 years experience in Graphic &amp; Web design, which is why I decided on a summer business) From there I would go to school in the fall to take, ""Web &amp; Development &amp; Programming"" (I'm super nerdy with web stuff.. nerdy in general).

Unfortunately, in late June is when things started to go bad. Nothing was coming in, I was doing all that I could to drum up business, I had to find work within my field (I didn't take a 15,000$ loan to end back up in a call center) to help pay bills. 

I received an offer from a local business who would train me from the ground up (cracker-jack entry level). I said that I wanted to go back in school in the fall to do my course because I am very interested in learning back-end development. They said, ""No, we want to train you. We don't want you going back to school, don't work on your business, we'll hire you full time; health benefits everything. Just work with us, you're awesome."" So, I weighed my options and said yes and was super excited to work for this business. Cancelled my schooling for the fall and went to work for them. 

Things were going ok, not great, but better I had a little hope for once. Then in October tension around office started happening, they would run to mail box for cheques to come in, internet was getting cut off, and turned into jerks. Then they me called in the office and let me go. No warning. nothing. Crushed. 

Immediately, I call the school I was planning to go, call student loan, call EI. Covering everything I needed to get myself on track I was planning on doing.

The ex-employers then decided to go on a wild goose chase with my ROE, and lie on it (false amounts). That resulted in my EI claim amount having a deduction. (I'm still waiting for an amended EI through an Investigation Control Officer, since October)

Two weeks later my cat had HUGE health complications and ended up passing away. That resulted in a $400 vet bill. 

Week after that my cell phone was cut off, resulted in a HUGE bill (contract).
Week after that my school says I need to pay my balance off owed to them: $1500
Week after that the bank, I got my grant from, wants their money $3000.
BAM! Xmas happens.  can't afford anything, so nothing there.

Now, its the new year. I received a job offer with a new company, a really awesome place, love it there, but I had to agree to a brief non-paying internship. It was the only opportunity I had, I had to take it and in the meantime continue looking for paying-jobs in my field until this internship is over. While on EI.

So, currently. I have $25 in my bank account. 
My bills are currently: 
Cell phone: 1200$
Credit Card: 750$
School tuition balance: 1500$
Bank Grant: 3000$
Vet Bill: 400$

As I said earlier, I live with my mother, her health is deteriorating, disabled and is only on a pension. So all her money goes towards her bills (90% of her pension is bills, its sickening) We live literally ""pay check"" to ""pay check"" and I'm sick of it! I help where ever I can with my mother bills, forfeiting my own bills because I hate seeing my mother depressed. We're late on power, water, cable, credit card, loans (those are hers).

I've been trying to start my business again, start a business for her (not going much of anywhere), selling stuff I don't really need to bring in money.

I don't know whom to talk to, or where to begin digging myself out of this financial hole I've found myself in again. How the hell can I get myself out of this and start saving money, ANY advice would be great; from saving money too how should I disperse my money to pay my bills, what to tell collection agencies to make them understand my current situation.

I'm totally at a loss where to begin, all I know is that I want to be in the green for my bills, my mothers bills and be able to not worry about where money for gas is going to come from.

17ea15,1,2013-01-27,"After several grueling years, I finally have free time, and I hate it.",alternate_music,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17ea15/after_several_grueling_years_i_finally_have_free/,"This seems so udderly bizarre but it's the truth.  Also a throwaway for reasons.

I had always kept pretty active in high school but college took that activeness to a whole new level.  I'm coming off an undergrad degree in Architecture that, while having many positive outcomes, also effectively owned my life.  I was so busy that despite being modestly good at time management, I regularly went without sleep, without meals, or without seeing roommates for days at a time.  It also probably destroyed my modest social life and may have contributed to deeper mental/emotional problems (despite professional recommendations for a proper clinical diagnosis, I never went through with it).  But, I don't regret any of that because I loved what I was doing and learned more than I even now realized.  And, it wasn't an unique situation, as most others in the program could relate.

But since graduating, and as I am struggling to find a proper job with my degree, I'm going from breakneck speed to a dead stop.  In the year since, I've tried to keep busy: aggressive job search, amending resumes, job fairs, part time jobs, professional training seminars, volunteer work, reading, composing, drawing, writing, traveling, sports, hiking, drinking, being active with friends and family, but at the end of the day, I still feel I'm being lazy.  It's like now that I have a normal life again, I think I'm not working hard enough.

Recently, I've returned to Graduate School because, well, I had intended to get a Masters sooner or later.  And either because I've gotten better at organizing myself or the workload isn't as horrendous (yet), I have another Sunday with all the work done and not much else to do.  So, I've applied for an internship or two around campus and while I write this, finish my essays for a scholarship application.  

I feel as though I miss that masochistic, soul crushing workload and it worries me why.  Am I just a busybody?  Is it work guilt? Should I start dating again (I know that always always took up SO much time)? Or is it the slow existential realization of another depressive episode of self loathing that I usually distract myself with a heavy workload mixed with a degree of self destructive tenancies (since I vividly remember how much my lack of sleep physically hurt after a while)? Or am I just bored?

I studied what I was good at, without really having any idea what I was going to with it. I've always done well in school, despite being rebellious and malingering often. In college, my professors expected so much of me, that I cracked in my final year, I just got overwhelmed to a point where I couldn't bear to set foot on campus. My parents have advanced degrees and are weighing heavily on me to graduate already and find a ""real"" job. I've had freelance gigs and internships and temp jobs, but my country has one of the worst unemployment rates *in the world*, and a massive proportion of the population lives below the poverty line. It's also close to impossible to immigrate. Everyone I know is struggling, and my parents are eager to maintain their middle-class lifestyle in spite of making ridiculous financial decisions, but let's leave that aside. 

But the worst part is - I've never really known what I wanted to do with my life. If I had the slightest idea, I could make an actionable plan and apply myself. At present, I can't even go back to take my remaining exams, because I don't have the money to pay the fees, but I can't get a job because there's fierce competition from people with already completed (and advanced) degrees and even decades of experience, but also rampant corruption and nepotism. 

I've also suffered from poor health, depression and social anxiety for well over a decade now, and I've tried everything that I could think of to rid myself of these (including related sub-reddits), but to little avail. I've also never been in a romantic relationship, so you can imagine the emotional and physical deprivation I'm feeling. So, my life is a complete black hole right now, and even though the only way is up from here, how do I figure out which path to take? There is no aspect of my existence that isn't soul-crushing right now, and yet, for the first time in a long, long while, I want to fucking **live**. 

So, any advice and personal stories about how you found your way in the world would be much appreciated. I want to take the noose my parents have put around my neck off and finally get my shit together. I know that there are limitations to what I can do due to my illnesses and social/economic/political constraints, but I sure as hell ain't gonna lay down and die.

Thanks ever so much!"

For now, I'm undertaking an independent study with a marine ecologist, and am trying to formulate a syllabus for myself. I'm hoping to start researching relevant subjects, particularly science-related. So, people that have experience with aquaponics, what course subjects do you think would be most relevant? Particularly science courses. The ind. study will be self-directed, so suggestions can be broad, or really specific. For example, for one part of the course I'd like to learn about the Nitrogen Cycle. Anyway, hopefully this made sense, and any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks!

so first of all, I am a MechE student that is about to graduate in 10 weeks or so. And I am on the fence between graduate school and jobs. 

 I started off college as an above average high school kid. my arrogance got the best of me by the end of freshman year and I got my butt kicked in my sophomore year. I was really lucky and grateful that i still had an internship by the end of my sophomore year. 
 As I move on in my undergraduate studies(core classes), I got more exposure(through coursework) to ME and I find myself to foster an interest in controls and thermodynamics. I am even currently auditing a graduate level course in Robotics.

so my current situations is that I have a ~3.0 major gpa and a 2.94 Overall gpa, passed the EIT,  and I've had two internship with the same company. (a fortune 100 company). But I didn't like the work because it was all CAD modeling with little analysis. I did, however, enjoy the hands-on prototype building and some of the light research work that I did. So they mentioned that they would like to have me back.
 I've been mass applying for jobs and luckily I've been selected to interview with companies like Chevron, Microsoft, PGE, General Mills, Lam's Research and etc but I just clutched on my interviews or my background is weak so I didn't get any offers.



 From my mistakes and failures I realized that I am not ""the shit"" as I thought I was and I also realized that through helping other understand or helping them with hw or even doing a lot of practices, I can learn better. People begin to perceived that I was smart because I was able to understand some of the material and help others with their understanding as well. by the end of my 4th year, I was very honored and glad that I met with a group of hardworking people through my classes and projects.
  With that said, I still do mediocre on exams(except thermo, controls, circuits, fluids, and FEA), while my project grades and hw grades were my lifesavers. i realized i suck at taking tests.
  Currently, I work at the computer lab as IT support on campus. But this is a dead-end job but I keep it because I need the money for rent and food.

 I am interest in doing some control related research or simulation research with 2 of the professors in my department. But I wonder if they would pay me as an undergraduate researcher. My plan is to probably join a design team for spring and summer while doing research with a professor if they are willing to 1.)hire me, 2.) pay me. 

 lastly, I also wonder if grad school is the right place for me or is it an escape if I don't have a job. I am certain that I don't want to go back to my internship place. i love the people and the culture but the line of work isn't for me. I really like alternative energy and defense industry.

Sorry for the long post. i don't know whether people will read this or not. but it did help me get some pressure off my chest.

I'm currently a junior at Auburn University in Alabama and I'm looking for some advice. I'm a finance major with minors in international business and Italian studies. I have a good overall gpa and a 4.0 major gpa. I have a great resume (at least compared to my peers') with a lot of extra curricular organizations and volunteer work. I also have a basic knowledge of spanish. I would like to work as an analyst, and eventually transition that into consulting once I have enough experience. I recently accepted an internship with an industry leader for this summer in a financial analysis role, although I've worked steady jobs since high school, I think this is my only relevant financial experience (I ran a store for a fireworks company over last summer and prepared some of the basic financial numbers, but I don't really count that). When I graduate, I would love to work in the Miami area (anywhere within 1 hour). Unfortunately, the firm I'm interning with does not have a location in the area. I know the job market in Miami has struggled recently, but I also know there is a solid financial sector. I would be willing to accept any relevant financial role, and would even accept less than I could probably make elsewhere to be in this location. I would be hoping for a salary between 40,000-50,000. Are my expectations unreasonable? Is there anything I need to start doing now to increase my chances? I've already started researching for the possibility of obtaining my level one cfa certification.

I hope you enjoy a story from my senior year of high school in a small town of 4000 people.  Graduating class size was 175 people. 

Growing up in Grand Rapids, MI area; it was the summer of 2006 and the trees were being smoked daily.  The group of friends I had in high school were the ""stoner jock"" type.  We all played sports throughout the years in school, but we all smoked trees often.  Before school, at lunch, after, on the weekends, etc.. Typical high school stoner kid.  

The beginning of my senior year started and I had begun an internship at a local car dealership as a mechanic.  Things were going great for the first few weeks.  Went to the internship everyday I was supposed to and things were going well.  Meanwhile, I decided one day that I was going to just skip it and go over to my buddies house to smoke a joint.  Nothing happened.  I got away with it.  I was the type of kid who would get away with something one time and then continue to do it until I get caught.  Not so much anymore, but definitely was that way in high school. 

So one day I get called down to the principal's office and I have no clue why.  He sits me down and asks me how the internship is going, how the other mechanics are, etc... Little did I know that he was letting me dig a deeper hole.  He then proceeds to tell me about every single day that I wasn't there and that they have known for about 2 weeks, thinking I would eventually show back up. He tells me that I'm kicked out of the internship program and that I'm going to have to clean the lunch room for the remainder of the semester. (almost 3 months left in the semester)

I was livid that I had to clean the lunch room after all the fucking messy kids eat their lunch.  I thought it was going to be living hell for 3 months.  I had to be with the janitor cleaning from 12:30pm until the end of the day, 3:30pm.  ""How the hell was I going to make it through this nightmare?!"", I thought to myself for the first couple of days.  Little did I know, the janitor I had to work with everyday had something perculiar about her.  I knew there was something there that we had in common... Come to find out, she fancied herself some fine herb as well.  

Fast forward two weeks to a Friday afternoon.  We were cleaning the lunch room and all the kids were gone to their classes for the afternoon.  I thought that it was a perfect time to bring up smoking bud.  I was right! We started talking about weed and whatnot, next thing I know I'm in her Ford Expedition leaving the parking lot and she's sparking up a joint.  ""This is the best punishment ever!!!"", I thought to myself.  I get kicked out of my internship for smoking weed and not going showing up and my punishment is to vacuum for a bit then roll around with the janitor and get stoned.  Score!! I'm down with that...

A few weeks later the janitor starts bringing me in brownies, cookies, etc.. All sorts of edibles that her husband and her were making.  It was literally like I had died and went to heaven.  The first time I had ever eaten a edible was on a Monday afternoon in my high schools janitor office.  

I didn't tell my friends until after we graduated 6 months later.  I didn't want any of them to get either of us in trouble by blabbing their mouth to the wrong person.  So it was my little secret the rest of my senior year.  I would see the janitor occasionally throughout the halls and she would smile at me and I could tell where she was going.  

Needless to say. I had a phenomenal start to my senior year in HIGH school.  If only I could go back there now... Wouldn't change a thing! :)

I hope you all enjoyed the story of smoking ganja with the school janitor. Toke on fellow Ents!

TL;DR - got in trouble for skipping internship to smoke weed with friends in high school.  Punishment was smoking weed with the school janitor.  "

Ask away!

Advice:
Print out at least 10-15 resumes on resume paper, you can have this done at NotesnQuotes or buy your own paper at any bookstore

Buy a padfolio! $20 at walgreens or a bookstore

Wear a suit

Research companies before hand, at the very least know what positions they are hiring for, but don't be afraid to talk to companies you haven't prepped for.

Have a little intro prepared, here's my typical one: Hi, my name's Yamas and I'm a senior majoring in Finance. On campus I'm involved in {insert RSO and position if you have one here} and this past summer I {Had an internship, took courses, (don't say this part if you just fucked around)}. I saw you're currently hiring for the Software developer role and I was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about the position. 
From here, go with the conversation and talk about your experiences to have a reason to give them your resume. I personally like to put a resume on top of my padfolio so they see I have one and may ask for it. 


That's all I have off the top of my head but I'm glad to provide more advice if needed."

Are there any Baltimore LEOs lurking this subreddit?  I have a few questions regarding the department as a potential employer.  

I live in the midwest, degree in CJ, looking for a full-time position with a city.  I heard Baltimore is hiring 300 officers.  This sounds perfect to me, I love Baltimore, it's a new challenge (I'm looking to get out of the midwest), the state tends to govern with my political views, etc.

If you're a Baltimore LEO, could you answer some questions for me?  If you're not comfortable publicly answering on this thread please PM me.

-How would you describe the camaraderie?  This is a big deal for me.
-Do you, overall, enjoy working for and reporting to this agency?
-Would you encourage someone to apply?
-Do you enjoy serving this community?  How is the relationship with the community?


-Finally, does BPD allow ride-alongs?  I hope so, this way I can get a ""feel"" for the agency.  

I have more questions but I don't want to seem arrogant.

I've had ride-alongs in bigger cities near me, and if they were hiring, I'd apply right away.  Policing in bigger cities is completely different from anything else.  It seems fun and challenging.  My internship with a suburban department was fun, but it was nothing like the city."

I'm talking real skinny. 6'6"" 160 lbs skinny.](http://i.imgur.com/YhqUOR1.png)

I fit every stereo type out there. I flew away in the wind. I turned to the side and disappeared. I had twigs for arms and legs. The list goes on.

The problem though, was I could not dedicate myself to getting bigger. Whenever I would visit the gym I would get discouraged (intimidated) by all the bigger people. Once I was able to get over that fear, my next issue was dedication. It's hard being weak and trying to work out, real fucking hard. Going in and trying and failing to press 75 lbs on the bench press will beat your psyche down real quick. Before I gave my self a chance to see progress, I'd quit. But being in high school, there were a lot of other skinny people too, so it wasn't much of an issue.

Then came college. After getting settled in my first semester and making friends, we teamed up and made a pact to hit the gym all spring. It worked great. We were lifting, getting stronger, looking good, I even managed to get up to 173 lbs. Awesome. Then summer hit.

Stopped lifting. No set schedule due to going home over the summer and not having a gym available. However, school started back up, but my lifting didn't. I was too far away from the University gym and I had no motivation to go. I was still comfortable with being skinny. I had a girlfriend now, I had my set friends, I was complacent and I would continue to be for the next two years.

Two summers I stayed at school for my internship and so did this new friend I made. He was an avid gym goer who convinced me to go. What the heck, I had nothing to do once I got off work everyday. So we started going regularly, and for the first time in my exercise career I was consuming whey protein shakes. These helped me tremendously when it came to gaining weight. By the end of the summer I had hit 185 lbs (on a good day). That'a solid 10 lbs in one summer. ""This is easy!"" I thought, so I was set on continuing to lift once school started.

SYKE!

Same shit happened again. I was still working and classes were a lot harder and time consuming than they used to be, so at 185 lbs I stayed...for another two years.

[about 185](http://i.imgur.com/Ee909AA.png)

Half way through my 5th year at university (yeah I know 5 yrs) my buddy who helped me reach 185 lbs approached me and introduced me to a new friend of his and his new lifting buddy. Upon meeting the new guy, I was invited (pressured) to come and lift with them, and I agreed. Even though they were outlifting me, I didn't want to seem like a bitch, so I kept up the best I could. Credit it to them for giving me a chance to take a break because I haven't lifted in awhile, but I did not heed that advice.

I couldn't move for the next week. I was so sore, my muscles were so tight, I was not ready to go back to the gym. But there they were, blowing my phone up, trying to set up lifting times, and there I was being flaky, not committing to anything. Then came the tough love.

The next time we were together they laid into me. Telling me I was unhealthy skinny with my rib cage visible, my chicken legs, and my thin wrists. That I didn't intimidate anyone, that's why I got pushed around at the bar and on the basketball court. That I could be huge, all I had to do was commit myself. I took all this to heart. I knew what they said was true. I was weak and frail. I was unhelpful when it came to moving heavy things (as was necessary every year when I moved apts) and I was having medical problems from my lack of muscle. My doctor looked me straight in the face and told me my lower back issue was because my core was to weak to support my upper half.

That's when I decided to get serious. Fuck being weak, fuck being skinny, fuck looking like a walking skeleton. I'm going to get big. I'm going to gain weight. I'm going to get strong. I'm going to look good.

Now where do I start?

First thing I needed to do was see what problems were inhibiting me.


1) I didn't eat enough.

* Yeah, I though I could eat a lot, and so did everyone else my whole life. It's easy to eat a ton of food for dinner when you don't eat breakfast and occasionally skip lunch.

2) I didn't eat healthy enough.

* Sure, eating a whole pizza in one sitting is a lot of calories, but they're shit calories. Your body would much rather have 2 lbs of chicken (and use it more efficiently, too).

3) When I did lift, I didn't follow a plan.

* Lifting willy nilly and doing whatever exercise you feel like doing at the time is not very effective.

4) My form was shit.

* Quarter squats, half bench presses, and swinging curls aren't going to get you very far.

Now that I got that out of the way. Let's get serious.


For the next year, I was serious. I ate 4000 kcal a day of good, lean food. Chicken, fish, veggies, potatoes  rice, eggs, protein shakes. 5 meals a day I was constantly shoving my face. Even supplementing my food intake with a half a gallon of (whole) milk a day for a couple months during that period. I lifted 4 to 5 times a week, sometimes 6. I was benching, and squatting  and deadlifting, and pressing. With good form, too. I spent so much time looking up lifting form on the internet, I feel like I can give beneficial information to anyone in the gym.


And you know what, it fucking worked. From January 2011 to January 2012 I went from 185 to 215 lbs. By March I was 230 lbs (unfortunately I was eating out too much at my new job and got pudgy from consuming almost 5000 kcal/day).

[Comparison](http://i.imgur.com/DWC9pdf.jpg)

So I was able to gain 30 lbs in year just by getting serious. I wanted that weight so I earned it. Currently, I'm sitting at 215 again (a stronger 215 than January) after cutting/slimming down from 230 lbs.


You may be wondering about my lifts. I'm going to use my lift numbers from when I started my serious lifting (January '11) to present. You can just assume the numbers before that were negligible. These are all one rep maxes.


Bench: 155 -&gt; 255 lbs
Squat: 135 -&gt; 315 lbs
Deadlift: 185 -&gt; 415 lbs
Overhead press: 65 -&gt; 185 lbs

1) I'm in my first semester of my sophomore year with a 3.7 major GPA (will be around a 3.88 or so after this semester) and a 2.92 cumulative GPA (soon to be a 3.1-3.2, but regardless I've never had lower than a C in any class and lower than an A- in a programming class) at a good university. I have taken 2 algorithms classes that are done in C++ and I'm currently taking a UI class (in Java), a Computer Organization class (which doesn't involve much programming, but it does use some C and assembly) and another Data Structures and Algorithms class (again in C++). I started off with Java about 5 years ago and continue to use it for side projects (I have 3 Android apps on the market and create games and videos with/over LibGDX). I would love to get an internship this summer but most places require that you have your sophomore year finished and have a 3.0 (which I will have by the end of this semester), when I'll only be halfway through. Would I have any chances at landing an internship based on my history of past projects and taking a few CS classes early and high major GPA (even though my cumulative is less than stellar? Also, being in Ohio, what could an intern be expected to have thrown their way in terms of compensation?

2) I currently work as a TA for my university's intro programming lab. Someone in the lab asked me to tutor them on the side and offered to pay. A) How do I charge? By the hour? By the session? B) How much do I charge? I know if I was a tutor through my school I'd be getting paid at least $9/hr (pay is dependent on the total and level of classes you can tutor for).

3) Now that I've been doing C++ for a short while (and Java for 5 years), I still don't feel very confident. I can do all of the basic tests that people have posted regarding job interviews (FizzBuzz, check if a string starts with an uppercase, check if a string is a palindrome, etc.) but I feel that's over-simplistic and once I passed that I'd be overwhelmed once I started working. What do companies really expect an intern to know and how much are they willing to teach you if you don't know it?

If you read through all of that, thank you! You're awesome."

17hsek,280,2013-01-29,Knock knock,regularcappuccino,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/17hsek/knock_knock/,"I'm renting a studio apartment in the big city while I have an internship. It's in an old building with one other apartment, and we both share a hallway with a locked door to the outside world at the end of it.

When I first got here, I arrived pretty late, so the landlord left a key for me in the letterbox and texted me the combination. The next day, when I came home from work, the key wouldn't work in the lock any more.

I was pretty puzzled, since it had worked perfectly before, so I called a locksmith to see if he could let me in. He told me the lock had failed, and it would have to be replaced completely, including with a new key. It cost me $300 all up, but I was tired and hungry and glad to be back inside, and I thought I could show the receipt to the landlord and be reimbursed.

Being the absent-minded person I am, every time I got home late from work I would see the receipt on the table and think ""That's right, I need to tell the landlord, and give them the new key."" But I never got around to it.

Then, a few weeks ago, I was lying in bed watching TV on a low volume before I fell asleep. I was just starting to doze off when I heard a sound that jerked me awake.

The sound of a key being inserted into my door.

I immediately jerked up in bed and gathered the covers around me, going through the list of people in my head who it might be. Not my parents, they're 5 hours away. Not a friend, none of them know this address. And besides, how would they get into the secure hallway?

Aside from me, the only person with a key was the landlord. And why the fuck would he let himself in unannounced at midnight? While I was sleeping? In the nude?

I sat there frozen, staring at the door in horror and waiting for it to open.

Except it didn't. I changed the locks.

As I sat there paralysed with fear, that fact slowly sank in. I changed the fucking lock when I moved in. They couldn't get in, because the lock screwed up and I was too flaky to tell anyone about it.

I slipped out of bed and pulled on my work clothes, then kind of just stood there in the middle of the room, with my phone in my hand, waiting for them to leave. I was way too scared to breathe too loud or even turn off the TV, in case they realised someone was inside. My door doesn't have a peep hole, but even if it did, I probably would've been too much of a coward to cross my room and stand that close to it. I felt like I was having a mini heart-attack.

The lock was audibly being manipulated at this point. Whoever was on the other side was loudly jiggling the key and shaking the knob, and I heard the door creak as though someone was leaning on it.

I was still ready to crap my pants, but my mind bizarrely wandered to how I would tell my parents about this. I clearly imagined my mum saying 'Well, did you tell them to go away?' and making up an excuse that it was just someone lost, or they got the wrong apartment. It sounds ridiculous, but I needed to prove that I wasn't an irrational person. I needed to prove that this wasn't just some silly mistake I was blowing out of proportion.

So I cleared my throat and let out a feeble: ""Hello?""

The shaking stopped immediately. This was almost worse than the noise from before. Every muscle in my body tensed listening for a sound, and I quickly decided to turn off my TV, since they already knew I was here. Then it was just me, the silence, and my mind working in overtime to try to explain who the hell this person was.

Until they knocked on the door. 
I stood dead still in the middle of the room, but my stomach gave an involuntary jolt at the sound.

He knocked again. 
A muffled voice came through the door, and it creaked again, like someone was leaning on it. 

""Hey, let me in.""

This might be the part of the horror movie where the dumb girl opens the door, just to satisfy her curiosity. But every cell in my body simultaneously screamed ""Oh, hell naw"". I decided I would continue with my currently plan: to stand tense and frozen in the middle of the room. Except I backed towards the kitchenette and grabbed the biggest knife I could find.

In the absence of my response, knock became a loud bang. First it sounded like someone was insistently pounding their closed fists on the door, but soon the whole door frame and wall shook from the impact. I realised the person was throwing their body weight against it.

At this point, I called the police.

I can't even remember what I said to them, I was so filled with white-hot panic. I was later told I screamed 'HURRY, SEND EVERYONE', which is a bit embarrassing. I had trouble remembering my address, but luckily it was still on the locksmith receipt still sitting on the table. (I owe that fucking guy a beer).

When I was talking to the operator, she said she could hear the guy trying to get in, and I should lock myself in the bathroom if I could. I guess he overheard me on the phone, because the banging abruptly stopped. Suddenly I was in the Jaws situation again, where the shark is gone but you know it's just under the water. I held onto the knife so tightly that my nails made a mark in the palm of my hand where they wrapped around it, and I kept asking the operator: ""What if he comes back?""

Luckily I didn't have to worry about that. The next people to knock on my door were the cops. They were able to get into the hallway because someone left the shared access door wide open. Of course the perpetrator was long gone.

I still don't know who knocked on my door that night, and I'm not sure I want to know. My New Year's Resolution was to stop putting things off, but now I know that good things come to those who wait (to talk about their new key).


tl;dr: Changed my locks, didn't end up knockin' on heaven's door."
17hsd1,124,2013-01-29,Riot Internships are terrifying,syntax_error42,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17hsd1/riot_internships_are_terrifying/,"Hello, 

  So here I am, sitting on campus looking forward towards my Capstone next year in my Media Arts &amp; Sciences program. I’m a game design student that focuses on environments, asset creation, and scripting,  but I also love theory crafting and making up new abilities, combat mechanics, and balancing. 


  The reason I’m typing this is because I’m sitting here, terrified as I look at the Riot Games Internship page, trying to piece together some answer to the puzzle that is an application. I fully believe that I’ve worked hard my three years of university so far, and I have learned a tremendous amount.  I’ve worked on a popular NWN mod called Higher Ground (http://highergroundnwn.net/) that up until the last couple years, was a fairly active and updated module. I’ve made levels in the Unreal Engine, and I’m currently working on an animated short where I’m learning rigging and doing lots of asset creation.


  What I guess I’m hoping to find by typing this, is some advice on what to focus on and what will help me stand out from the crowd. I’ve played very little ranked up until now (sitting at 1393 after my 10 placement matches), though I always say I’ll find the time, but I’m always busy with studies and just stick to normals. I do follow the competitive scene a lot, because it’s easy to watch tournaments while modeling! I do help host a league of legends club, and we’ve had some great success and are currently looking towards Ivy LoL. 

Thank you!
 
tl;dr Any advice for internship hopefuls other than what's on the riot page? XD

Any thoughts?",[deleted],gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/17hqj2/debating_about_going_to_george_brown_college/,"Many moons ago, I wanted to be an artist. As far back as I can remember, it is all I did. When I was 7, I made my own comic books. When I was 12, I drew my own game levels and art. This culminated in me applying for, and being accepted to, various Art schools across North America when I finished high-school. Well, the problem was, I no longer enjoyed drawing/painting. In Canada, you are forced to choose what you want to go into University for, prior to completing highschool (by picking Pre-Req's). So, with art now out of the picture, I went down a different stream, but not the stream I wanted.  

I am now in my mid 20's, and I want to get into Game Development. Something that I have enjoyed my entire life, right along side art, and thought previously impossible (when I was graduating). 

George Brown College has begun, within the last 3 years, offering a multi-year Game Development program. Where the class room is setup like a studio, and you learn using the industry standard tools (UDK, 3DS, Maya Etc..). A few articles have been written about it in various papers in Canada, and they have presented their students work at various digital art shows around the city. The issues I find, are I can't find any information about employment, internship prospects or, really, anything job related. 

My question for this sub-reddit is, would it be worth it? Would it improve my chances of being hired? I am afraid not only because of my age, but because I don't want to waste 3 years of my life, just to find out it was a junk program that was so specific it leads in no other direction. 

Any help would be appreciated! "

This person was buried in full clown costume with makeup and all. The whole family was clowns, all the friends were clowns. And at the familys request, the funeral directors were clowns too. They supplied costume and did our makeup. Family and friends had 1 tear drop painted on near the eye. Definitely my strangest.

It was the most interesting funeral service to date. At first we didn't want to do the whole makeup and costume thing but the family insisted. I'm glad we did, we had a lot of fun; which is something you don't want to do during a service but this one was completely different and had a totally different vibe than a regular funeral service.

One time I had prepped this man. I came into the prep room to do some laundry and things. As I walked passed him, I noticed a small piece of lint in his ear from the towel I used to dry him off. I took my gloved pinky and kinda swiped it out. I proceeded to fold some towels. The next thing I know I felt something touch my ear, near the ear opening. It felt just like someone stuck their finger in my ear but there was noone around. The next day I was looking through the obituaries (i read the obituaries of the cases i work on) and sure enough this man had one. It mentioned how much of a prankster and fun he was. I guess I was his last prank.
 |My first experience at work was when I first started my embalming career. I worked at an independent mortuary service. I had just started my shift and was using a restroom in the back. When I came out, I heard what sounded like a girl sobbing and the sound of feet shuffling around on the floor. The floor was kinda gravely and had a distinct sound if you scooted your feet on it. The sound was coming from around a corner that led into a small room where we would store embalmed bodies ready to be delivered to their respective funeral home. I figured someone was upset and crying. So I kinda snuck in, still hearing the sobbing. When I peaked around the corner, the room was empty. No living person in there. I noticed that there was only one body in there as well. A young girl. She shot herself in the side of the head. I wasn't scared per say, but I'm pretty sure you could audibly hear my heart beat.

It never really bothered me. Probably because I didn't have kids at the time. I've seen people get in this business with kids and absolutely cannot embalm or even attempt a child.

[How is saved by the bell related to the funeral service? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858wlh?context=5)|Back in the early days it was a huge fear to be buried alive. This has to do with the fact that medical science was shit at the time. Some people were just comotose, they couldn't tell if you were dead or not. That's why there was a 'wake' service where they would lay you out in state to see if you would 'wake' up. So these caskets were developed with a hole through the top, a string was placed in the deceased's hands and ran up out of the hole, through a tube to the top of the ground. The string was attached to a bell. So if you weren't actually dead, you could ring the bell. You would in fact be, 'saved by the bell'.

Ninja edit: morgue -&gt; mortuary.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85bvza?context=5)|Wow! You mean one of you actually care about the mortician? The most frustrating thing for an embalmer with a posted case is that when you guys remove the throat, tongue sometimes the carotids are cut or nicked so high up it becomes a very difficult challenge to get the head injected. And the head is the most important part. Whenever this happens we say, ""must've been training day"". I would say try your best to preserve the arteries, especially the carotids. Veins don't matter in a posted case.

Mine was at mortuary school during embalming lab. The county would have their cases embalmed at the school for practice. The deceased was an autopsy and had no legs. I was just looking at her, autopsy incisions open, the empty cavity inside. Her hands looked as if to be gripping the edge of the table. Her mouth wide open because we haden't closed it yet. She looked like she was screaming silently in pain. That was my wtf moment, you get over it.
[I work in eye tissue donation. I've had people refuse because ""They need them to see their loved ones when they get to heaven."" What exactly happens to the eyes during an embalming? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85b9nq?context=5)|The eyes usually start to flatten after death. Think of an old grape. They do, however, remain with the decedent. We don't remove them. You can use what is called an eye cap to put over the flattened eyeball to recreate the natural curvature of the eye. You can also inject tissue builder directly into the eyeball and fill it up. And sometimes, the embalming fluid will fill the eye to normal size.

When I was 12, there was a bad head on collision near my house. A man in a truck didn't make it. My family and I were standing around with all the other neighbors when the coroner arrived. He pronounced, then they took him out and put him on a stretcher, his head turned to the side looking straight at me. I remember being curious as to what happens to people when they die, as far as the physical body.

A hand model. The family came in early for the visitation to set up pictures and things. I show them in, help them get started then leave them so they can do their thing. I come back in about 10 min to check on them and just about every picture they put up was this persons hands from the various ads they did. There were some family photos, but most were a pair of hands. It was funny to me because most people will put up whole pictures.

Like what kind of person would make a good mortician?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85bkea?context=5)|It's funny. I was a waiter for many years in my younger days. I always say, If you can be a successful waiter, you can be a successful funeral director. They are similar in ways. They both wait on families, both provide what should be excellent customer service. Just that one puts a pizza in the oven, the other puts a body in the oven. But really anyone who is good with people and customer service should do well.
[Hey Mortician. I've worked with the dead for a few years in my life. One time I picked up a woman who OD'd and I believe had been ruled dead for over a day. When I put her in the body bag, I started talking to the coroner. While my attention was distracted, the bag started rubbing against my leg. I could feel the blood flush out of me like a tidal wave and literally turned bone white. I was told this was caused by the gases escaping the body. Do you see this phenomenon often or at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85ewiq?context=5)|So the bag filled with gas and pressed against your leg? I've never seen that. Sometimes when you move them, air escapes the throat and they make noises. Sounds like a snore.

I can see where it would save an embalmer a step in that they just leave it in. But such an embalmer would be lazy. All medical tubes, IV lines, etc should be removed during embalming and the holes left behind are sutured and glued.

[So a mortician is the person who prepares bodies for funerals then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859jb2?context=5)|Yes. Mortician is a term that applies to a person who is both funeral director and embalmer. In my state, not every funeral director is an embalmer, but every embalmer is a funeral director. The embalmers will prepare a body for burial.

[What's the pay like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85ajym?context=5)|Depends on the funeral home. Large corporate funeral homes will low ball you. Independent's will usually pay more.

It's funny to me about exactly how little the general public knows about this industry. It's a myth. People are embalmed on their backs. Another myth is that we cut off the legs of tall people so they fit in the casket. Our secret: put something uner the legs so that the knees are bent.
[This might have already been asked, but what is the most common thing that the public thinks about the industry that isn't true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85brok?context=5)|The misconception that every funeral director is filthy rich. you might make a decent living, but only the owners get rich.

Burned bodies smell like burned meat, no different than if you burnt a steak. Electrocuted bodies have a sweet scent to them, reminds me of roasted marshmallow. Decomps can be really horrible to be around and if you're around the long enough it will make you sick. -I am a licensed funeral director and embalmer. I make arrangements with families, I work on funeral services, I embalm all our bodies at the funeral home. I run errands, I take clergymen, hospice people out to lunch sometimes. There's a lot to do.

One time we made a house call. The deceased lady was over 500 pounds. We just wrapped her up in the sheets and blankets she was on and dragged her out. When we eventually got her on the prep table and started taking the sheets off, all this debris started coming out. Potato chip bags, candy wrappings, 2-liter coke bottles. Then I hear a clang on the ground, the lady had a locked &amp; loaded glock.

[Hey! Thanks so much for this. I think this is my first time actually asking a question on r/IAmA, actually.  Anyway, I live in New Orleans. And if you've ever been there, you'd know that we pretty much put our dead on display. Because of that, and the inordinate amount of funerals that I've attended in my 19 years on earth, I've found that I have a fascination with death. More specifically, the traditions that are synonymous. I've put serious thought into becoming a Mortician, but as of now, I don't think that it's the right choice for me.

It makes it so worth it. It can be a thankless career path. You gotta pat yourself on the back and say attaboy because noone else is gonna tell you. But when it comes from the family you served, it is very rewarding.

I always slice the back of tshirts, shirts, and jackets. It just makes it easier to dress. I don't like jostling around with the body incase they purge some fluids. You can get the pants on without cutting unless they are too small. I work with a guy that cuts nothing, I chuckle as he struggles with a body.

If so, can you explain some of the nuances to me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85d3hd?context=5)|It's been a while. There are Jewish funeral homes here. They typically bury the next day. No embalming, if they do embalm you have to save the blood in jars to bury with them. Orthodox Jewish believe that part of your soul resides in the blood. That's why the body is usually intact. Typically in a wood casket, all wood, no metal parts. That's about all I recall without looking it up.
[Do you ever get weird requests about the body from family members? I went to a funeral where they had the (open\) coffin propped up so the dude was standing up, it was bizarre.

He is quite shy guy. Does not like talking to people. He is a student. Now he is doing internship at a large company. About three months ago he got a job. Recently. I found he has been talking to one of his co worker,who started job as the same day as my BF.lives in Leeds (I did not see he had talked with the other co workers) Because his job. he needs to go up to Leeds (we are staying in London) two days per week. Where he stays in a hotel. Going through his texts I can see they take train from Leeds to where he works together also take train back to Leeds after work. He told me she had asked him go out for drink twice. This first time was the second day they met. Somehow she cancelled it. (He told me this because I was confronting him. othwewise He would have never told me about this,even though he would never mentioned when he called me at the night after he finished his work) He works from home most of time. They talk on the Internet. Some messages that My bf showed me was about job and some personal stuff. Like what they did at the day off. Some messages my bf just closed the conversation windows so I could not be able to check. He says there is nothing to see. I got jealous one day.I really want to get over it so I asked my bf to invite her to go out with us (pretend I was going up Leeds with him) My bf refused to do so the reason was ""if I confirm the exctally day going to Leeds with you. I will ask her to come with us""actually he knew he was going in the same week.
We had fight about this. We end up by texting her said""me and my girlfriend coming to Leeds would you like to come for drink with us "" the next day morning.

He says the conversation is closed. He switched off his laptop while I insisted to go thought it.
I can't understand. All he says about is for his job. But he does not have the other people's number. They are not doing some project together. Does it need to talk every day? My bf thinks I am fucking crazy. Yes.I WAS cheated on two times by my ex. However,I dont think my BF have cheated on me this time. but still it makes me so uncomfortable. makes him so cheap.

17hmb5,5,2013-01-29,Career advice anyone?,secret-user,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/17hmb5/career_advice_anyone/,"**Hello Reddit.**

First I want to say that I'm sorry about bad writing in this post. It's just a subject that is really close too my hart. And I'm not super good at english grammar. 

Let me introduce myself. I'm 19 years old. I've been in love with games since I was a young one. And I figured out early that I some day wanted to work with games. But I didn't think it was possible for a normal human being. So I started taking computers apart, and setting them back together to better try to understand how it all fit together. When I understood the aspect of computer parts, and their role. I quickly got bored of just doing hardware. Thats when I started exploring web applications.

I guess I was about 14-15 years old when I started exploring the different web technologies. I started learning html and css. It was a lot of fun. But everything I made looked like crap. I remember one day I got into my classroom, And I saw a lot of people standing in front of the one computer in the room. I heard them laughing, So I walked up to check out what they where laughing about. And it was my website. It was a rough time to get though. But after some time, I decided it wouldn't break my spirit. And thats when I started learning Photoshop, JavaScript and PHP. It took some time to get it all down. But It was god damn worth it. Now I'm one of the two interns in town. Actually in this whole region! And i'm proud of that. 

Here is where the game development comes in. I started learning c++ and java after work hours the last year. And I feel like I'm starting to get a ok grasp of the basics. I guess what I'm asking is:

- Do my web development work make me more valuable in the game development industry? 

- If I keep up doing what I do here as an intern, I have quite the opportunity to have a good stable income. Is their any chance to get a good paying job in a game development office for one like me? 

- And does anyone have any solid advice for how I should go about my career? I want to one day become a good game programmer.


**TL;DR**

- Do my web development work make me more valuable in the game development industry? 
- If I keep up doing what I do here as an web dev / design intern, I have quite the opportunity to have a good stable income. Is their any chance to get a good paying job in a game development office for one like me? 
- And does anyone have any solid advice for how I should go about my career? I want to one day become a good game programmer.

My mind floating around somewhere. I don’t know exactly when or how it happened. I just realized how miserable I am, how sad and lame my life has become. Who am I? What happened to me? I miss myself, where did I go? How did I become like this? I am depressed, I know it. I know what I have to do to change everything. I’m way too depressed to do anything other than spending all day by myself, inside my mind talking to myself staring at some screen. It’s become so fucking lonely, darn it, I hate feeling lonely. I have been alone for the past two years, not literally. I have grown so much, mentally. I have loved and I have hurt over the past two years. I think I’ve hurt more. I am a fucking coward, so fucking miserable. Ocassional suicidal thoughts go through my mind every single day. I imagine how a bullet to the heart or the head would end my suffering, instantly. On a second thought I think I don’t deserve that right. I’ve been given absolutely everything. I have never had to complain about money, my parents have been generous enough to support me until today, my last college semester. I have loved and been loved back. I have travelled. I have true friends who are there if I need them. Yet, it feels like I am the last man standing on earth, with no one to talk to, no one that I can be myself with. There are so many people who would perform brilliantly, become great people, and do good to the world if they ever had what I have. I honestly feel like I am turning into a crazy guy, slowly but surely. I clench my teeth and tighten my fists because I feel an undescribable desperation a combination of anger, sadness, and anxiety. What the fuck is wrong with me???? 


About myself: I spent a year abroad in Germany from July-2010-July2011. As soon as I got there I realized there was this girl who was really into me. I was driven to promising her some sort of relationship for when I got back (for some odd reason, I wasn’t thinking as you will see, that happens a lot). Then I met Ana, she was from Montenegro, she was really friendly and also beautiful. We started hanging out with a bunch of other people. I liked her, but it turned out so did one of my “friends”, Luis (a guy I had met pretty much at the same time I met her) and I was “dating” the other girl on Messenger Video Chat. Luis and Ana made out one night when we were partying in Frankfurt, I got kind of jealous but nothing out of the ordinary. I kept hanging out with them (and other people) because we always had so much fun. One day, we were supposed to go out all together. I ended up alone with Ana. I didn’t plan anything. We kissed a lot that night. It was really romantic actually. I had to tell the other girl that it wasn’t going to work out, but didn’t want to mention about Ana because I didn’t want to make her feel worse (I never had any sort of physical contact with that girl). So I stayed with Ana, for three more weeks. My exchange program was designed so that I would spend only five weeks in Frankfurt, then move to another city for a whole semester. Ana’s program intended her to stay for a few weeks more in Germany after I left Frankfurt and then go back to Montenegro. Since I am a coward, I didn’t want to tell Luis that I was dating Ana. By the end of the three weeks I was feeling really crazy about her. She had her first sexual experience with me, but we didn’t have sex (I think this is relevant). So I moved out, and I had to say goodbye to this awesome woman. Two weeks later I woke up in the room of a Russian exchange student. We were celebrating the Mexican independence day in Germany, there was this huge party thrown by Mexican students. Things got crazy during the night, we clicked, kissed, and had an awesome night. For some reason, my not-thinking part of the brain kicked in and thought it would be best to date this girl. I want to think that choice was either the best or the worse I’ve made in my life, because it defines me. It was easy at first, but shortly after, really tough. I don’t know why I was persistent in staying with her when she was giving me a hard time. When I had decided I had to break up with her. After 5 months I was going to break up, I was so sure about it. I knew I didn’t want to be with this person, even if I had feelings of love for her, there was no future in that relationship. She went on a ski trip to the Italian alps at the end of the semester. I stayed and partied with my buddies. Then I get a call. She had an accident and dislocated her hip. She must walk with the aid of crutches for two months. There was no way in the world I was going to break up with her after such horrible thing happened. So I supported her and took care of her for  a month. Hip dislocation is one of the less common injuries, so it’s pretty bad. After that I had to move out again. The semester was over and I had found an internship in a city close from where I was (40-50 min train ride). That month brought us closer together and I totally forgot about my feelings from a month ago. So I just kept going, not thinking, for more than a year. During my internship we would only meet during weekends and we wouldn’t always have the best time. I got invited to her sister’s wedding in Paris and met her family, pretty big deal huh? So, during my stay in Germany I applied for a master’s program in the US. Got accepted so here I come USA. At the end of my stay in Germany, she came home with me to meet my parents. She spent a little over a month with us. After that, time to go to the US. Long distance relationship is tough! Fastforward a lot of problems and skype days later and she’s back home with me to spend xmas and new years with my family. Next semester starts, and problems continue to escalate, things become more and more complicated and apparently everything I do is wrong and I screw everything up. I was amazed of how much pain I was causing being so fucking far away. That semester I made a friend, from my own country, let’s call her Mary. So Mary and I became really good friends, and I seem to enjoy a lot spending time with Mary. My Russian girlfriend is giving me a hardtime over everything I do (I can be more detailed if you want), so in order to avoid problems I purposefully decided not to tell her about my meetings with Mary, because for me they were honest friendly encounters. FFW a few months, end of second semester in the US and Mary tells me how much she likes me. I just bought tickets to go to Russia and try to make things up and see how I feel, by being around her and her family. I was so lonely during that month in Russia. Tried to break up with her, she wouldn’t let me. Decided that if she was so sure and stubborn about us being together, I should keep trying to make things better and not be an asshole trying to finish things the easy way. I came back to the US to finish my last couple of months. I meet Mary, she’s not happy that I’m still with Russian, tries to say goodbye, then wants to be friends again literally five minutes later. Couple of weeks later I cannot be with Russian anymore, so I break up for good. One of the worst nights of my whole life, cried like baby, and not something I want to remember much, but something that is worth remembering because on the impact it had on my life. A few days later I kissed Mary.

17hgk6,1,2013-01-29,Tune your tiny violins now...,Throwaway_to_vent,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17hgk6/tune_your_tiny_violins_now/,"I just had a bit of a breakdown tonight after a culmination of things. I really need to get my thoughts down in words and hoped I might get some guidance from my fellow redditors.  Not sure where to start so I'll just go...

*Pre-High School*

I was a quiet, nerdy boy raised in a small town. My mother was/is a teacher and both sides of my family were very well known in town. As such, I was a do-gooder. I rarely got in trouble. When I was about 10 my parents told my sister and I they were getting a divorce. Strangely, this never bothered me. The night they told us I cried, but really it was only because everyone else was. I was put in a divorced kids support group in school, but didn't really need it as it made sense to me for them to separate if they didn't love one another anymore. In 8th grade my first ""relationship"" with a female consisted of ""being together"" for 2 days. When she broke up with me I was devastated. In my sadness I coined a phrase that has stuck with me (and apparently my father as he mentioned it a few months ago): ""There may be plenty of fish in the sea, but I don't want a fish, I want a mermaid.""

*High School*

I was still a nerd. My ""varsity jacket"" consisted of Marching Band, Symphonic Band, and Bowling.  I was still quiet but started to come out of my shell in a 6 month long relationship my sophomore year. Again I was devastated upon being broken up with. She was in the marching band with me and, therefore, I had to see her every day. Not 2 weeks after the end of it, one of my good friends at the time started dating her. This hurt me bad. I began suffering from depression. At this time I began trying to draw attention to myself, preying off of sympathy. I would (for lack of a better word) ""bounce"" a knife blade on my arm to leave marks that didn't really hurt, but looked like they did. On a band trip to Disney World I was stuck in the same group as my ex and friend. To get attention I decided to bash my head on a table multiple times to get a good sized lump and then feigned a concussion. I have never told anyone that I was faking it. I even went as far as to claim I had lost control of my eyes and was rushed, via ambulance from the park, to the hospital. My father was there as a chaperon and to this day I regret making him go through all of this. 

I then started dating another girl. It helped my emotional state at first but it didn't last. We were together for 2 years. We lost our virginity to one another. It took me a year to realize that I didn't actually like her, and another year to get the courage to end it. I've always been a ""nice guy"" and didn't have the heart to hurt her.

*College*

This girl and I were still together when I started college. She was 1 year younger than me and was therefore still in high school. After a week of being at school I made the decision to end the relationship. However, I could not justify ending it any other way but face-to-face and had no plans to return home for another week. That week was the one of the most difficult of my life. We spoke every day and with each ""You're going to love me forever, right?"" a part of me died as I had to say ""Yes"" without meaning it. I ended it that weekend when I went home and, while sad for what I had done, felt free.  I mean, I'm now single college student at a school with a 2-to-1 girl to guy ratio! Time to let loose, have some random sex, drink alcohol (my first drink was 2nd semester of freshman year) and live a college life. Well, that didn't happen. I had a new, amazing group of friends that, while they were more the ""rebel"" types (smoked weed, were promiscuous, etc) they cared about me more than any friend ever had. I realized all my high school friends were just people I hung out with and played video games with. They were not there for me emotionally. That entire first year I never even kissed a girl outside of a game of spin-the-bottle. I was happy, but at the same time, felt empty. (Now is a good time, I guess, to mention that I am a lover; I love to love and I love to be loved. Being single is not my preference.)  

My sophomore year I began dating another girl. She was amazing. She was funny, zany (as most art majors are) and (as I later found out) completely incompatible with me. We had fun together and I did love her. However, upon hanging out with her group of friends, I noticed... *something* between her and another guy. I don't believe anything happened between them, but I could just tell: this guy is going to end up with my girl. I was right. A few months ago they got engaged. When she broke up with me, I was lost again (see a trend?), but recovered much faster than before. This is most likely because I found a rebound. However, this rebound (I will call her K) made me even happier than my ex.    

It was about this time I began doing 2 things that made a huge impact on my relationships: I began smoking weed and I began playing World of Warcraft. At first, neither one caused issues; K was fine with my late night raids and would even join me in toking up now and again. I eventually dropped the smoking of weed as I was due to find an internship for my degree. However, I found the desire of inhalation of smoke to be too strong and began smoking cigarettes. I did my best to hide this from K (and to this day, don't know if she ever knew) as I wasn't sure if she'd have been okay with me being a regular smoker. I wasn't a heavy smoker by any means, maybe 3 cigs a day max. The WoW, on the other hand, began to cause problems. I began to play it much more than I should have, skipping classes and turning down sex (I know, I had a problem) to play a game with people I had never met. I'm not saying I don't have plenty of fond memories from the game, I'm just not sure they were worth it. 

In the summer after my 4th year (I was on a 5 year plan due to a change in majors and my being too lazy to take more than the minimum number of classes) and her 3rd year (she was on track for a 3 1/2 year degreee; she was an overachiever) K went on a study abroad to Australia. While she was gone, I had promised to try my damnedest to find an internship. While I did try, I didn't try hard. I spent the summer working for around 5-8 hours a day and playing WoW for around 12-14. Upon returning home, K broke up with me after 2 1/2 years of being together. Looking back, I don't blame her. I was a useless piece of shit. I was unmotivated, wasn't taking care of myself (reached my peak weight of 265lbs (I'm 5'8)) and was just wasting oxygen. This one was the hardest for me as I had intended on proposing to her that Christmas. It took me weeks to be able to get out into society without breaking down at the sight of any minute thing that made me think of her. 

I would love to say that this jolted me into a better man. It did not. My smoking of cigarettes increased threefold and I began smoking weed again because I gave zero fucks about an internship at that point. I slept around a bit (5-6 partners, nothing crazy, but still more than I had ever before) and began doing worse in my classes. Then I made the best move of my college career: I joined a fraternity. Now, this is not some ""get drunk, degrade women, beat pledges"" fraternity that you see in the movies. The fraternity I joined (Phi Mu Alpha) is a music fraternity. This essentially means we ware all music nerds who gathered together with the aim of advancing music. This was a group of guys I related to more than anyone I had ever met. I love my brothers. Because of this group of guys, I began doing better in my classes and generally had a better outlook on life. I was happy.

*Post-College*

Nearing the end of that final year, I still had yet to find an internship. This was required for my degree so essentially I was going to be going into my 6th year to finish it. I was still pretty unmotivated to find one, but lucked out when, on a whim, I asked the technology director at the school system in my home town if they could use an intern. As luck would have it, they just had someone leave and needed help. I began working part-time as an intern (decent hourly wage) and worked as a server for additional money (around 70 hours a week total). I moved in with my grandparents (my parents moved out of town) to save on rent and food. Now, my home town is boring and devoid of people my own age. When I wasn't working, I was (still) playing WoW.  At the end of the summer (and my internship) they began taking applicants for the position in the tech dept. I applied and succeeded in getting the full-time position. This was great, a good entry level job to start building my resume and begin saving money. I eventually (finally) quit playing WoW (telling my guildmates I was quitting was about as bad as breaking up with someone) and dropped the hours working at the restaurant.

*One year later*

That brings me to today. I'm now almost 25, still smokin. I've found a good group of equally nerdy guys to hang out with. While I love my new (most are actually old) friends, I miss my brothers in the fraternity. I have now been single for just over 2 years, the longest amount of time I have been single since I first started dating. I haven't had sex in over a year, the longest amount of time since sophomore year of college. I've asked 1 girl out and she accepted(!), but then canceled and told me she was interested in someone else. Being a bad saver, I have managed to stockpile zero extra money. Last week, my car died. I just accepted a role in a play in the local theatre. This role requires me to kiss another man. The man in this role is gay, which does not bother me in the slightest. However, tonight I was overwhelmed with the thought that this man would be the first person I will have kissed in almost a year and, if things keep going the way they are, might be the last I kiss for another year. I lost it. I'm so lonely. And now I'm about to reach the 10k letter limit. Any kind words would be appreciated."

I have past work experience, however, it's complicated.

As part of an honor's program at my high school, all students were required to work an internship one summer, I managed to score an internship at a small independent game company, and managed to even get hired back after my internship was completed. But then things got rough. Eventually, I ended up walking out.

Now, I'm unsure about whether or not I want to put this job on my resume. I feel I grew a lot as a person from my time working, and I feel like having past experience gives me a huge leg up on the competition. However, I'm afraid that if someone tried to contact my former employer, that they won't have anything nice to say about me.

So I'm not totally sure what to post so I'll make it brief -- I've been trying to lose weight since November. I started out at 195 (I'm 5'5"") and my goal weight is 130. I'm currently weighing in at around 183 or so. I've cut back on dairy and and sodium mostly, as well as going jogging twice a week and doing yoga twice a week. The problem I'm having is that (a) I live in a small town and there are only 3 gyms, all of which I can't really afford since I barely make any money and (b) jogging and other related activities are really hard for me because they make my breasts hurt even with a sports bra and it aggravates my plantar fasciitis.
I'm really trying to find some cardio that works well. 
I posted on a different subreddit in a moment that was not one of my brightest and was met with some harsh shit, from ""just fucking work out its not that hard stop making excuses"" to ""your boobs are only big because you're fat""... Honestly, any advice better than that would be helpful from some workouts to relevant threads to clothing that could help. Please keep in mind that I don't have a lot of disposable income or a car and I work about 60 hours a week so If possible under an hour a day would be great. Thanks a lot (:

Edit: people keep asking me why I don't have enough money for a gym. I work as an unpaid intern for a nonprofit 30-40 hours a week and 20-25 as a barista which pays for the entirety of my expenses"

I'm a sophomore in my engineering program and am having a hard time choosing a declared major between civil and environmental engineering. I was hoping to get some input and advice from engineers working in either field. 

As I said, I am a sophomore and I'm doing very well in the program so far: 3.9 major GPA, involved in ASCE, EWB, etc, and I've begun looking for internships. There are a few more internship opportunities at my school for civils, which is one of the draws for that major, but I'm still drawn to environmental, especially as I'm told that the job prospects are supposed to be better in the coming years. I'm obviously still learning, but I think I'm more interested in water systems and water resource engineering than say structural engineering, and I'm told that environmental is a better path for that. However, I've also been told that as a civil I can take classes on these subjects, get my emphasis in them, but still be more employable in the long run since it is a broader degree.

I realize you probably get asked these kinds of questions often, so I apologize for that. But any advice as to the job outlook in either field, what you think the future holds, or suggestions on what to emphasize in would be much appreciated. Thanks!"

That is as it naturally decided to be today, its untapped potential, if you will. The second to last one is how I used to wear it for my internship.  The last one is how I used to wear it in high school.  I wanted to include it because it gives the full gamut of my hair.

So, despite the last picture, I'm actually a complete noob when it comes to hair.  I feel like I can dress myself fine and look good in a wide variety of outfits (I'm tall, sort of thin).  But I am never happy with my hair and face.  I feel like most of my attempts at styling it have been disastrous, I'm not very familiar with how to maintain a look, or what products I can use. 

I looked over the hairstyle thread, but didn't feel comfortable that any of the ones I'd like would work for me.  Although that may be my lack of confidence about my hair peeking through.  My hair is thin (always has been), wavy, soft like a baby's, and unruly even with product (from my experience). I'm not sure if that is because of the wrong haircut, the wrong product, or my misapplication of it.

I'm at a loss. Any advice on how I should cut and style my hair?"
17gpt1,204,2013-01-28,"That one time I went on a date with a sociopath, or another reason I should stop online dating.",[deleted],DatingHell,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingHell/comments/17gpt1/that_one_time_i_went_on_a_date_with_a_sociopath/,"So this story is about another guy I met on OkCupid, and has also been put up on reddit before. I still get chills down my back over this one. 
His profile said he was a 23 year old law student at a nearby law school. He was fairly good looking and seemed charming and polite and we talked about a mutual love for Terry Pratchett's Discworld. I gave him my number and agreed to a date. The date was relatively unremarkable, he took me to my favorite restaurant and then we went to a quiet bar and talked till the wee hours of the morning. Later on, I realized that he mostly parroted me, keeping the conversation going.

The next morning I wake up to check my messages on OkC and notice his profile was taken down. For me this sort of behavior sets off **""Stage V Clinger""** alarm bells, so I decide to try to google him, despite the name he gave me being probably the most common name in the US (M--- Smith). Well, obviously nothing came up. However, we both had iPhones, and his messaged me from an email address rather than a phone number, and it was a rather odd email address (MNB-----@y00hoo.com) so I tried googling M--- B-----.

Well that pulls up about 3 dozen articles from 4 years ago about a local law student (M--- N B-----) who was arrested after threatening to kill his ex-gf, her new bf and her family. He also had a plot in place to murder his former law professor. While executing the search warrant, police found 14 illegally owned guns, 4 stun guns, and a massive collection of child pornography on his computer. The guy I went out with was definitely the same guy - his mug shot was on the first article and I knew it was him the moment I saw it. The man is 27 years old, was in jail when he should have been taking his bar exam, and is the best fucking liar I've ever met. 

There were also multiple websites m---nb-----.com/.ca/.net all about how he was a world famous chef/musician/chess player/tennis coach/etc, obviously written about himself, probably as an attempt to clear the front page of google of the news articles featuring him. 

I should note that on the date, he *told me the story of his arrest and trial*, only he said it was currently happening to a client of his as an intern in a law office. I was advised never to text, email, or IM someone threats because it's considered a federal offense - transmitting threats across state lines.

I never contacted him again. I was terrified and being advised to call the police from family and friends, but didn't hear from him for a while and finally let out a breath of relief. [**Bullet=dodged**](http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs1/1883898_o.gif)

Then, two weeks later, he texts me again. ""Hey, how have you been?"" I ignored it, and then about 6 hours later with no response, he texts me ""You know you could stand to lose about 40 lbs, fatty. Take care."" I really wanted to text back ""You know, you could stand to lose about 4 counts of child pornography possession"" but I didn't because I didn't want to set him off. It took every ounce of will power not to though. I'm such a smart ass it's hazardous to my health."

During my first internship as an athletic trainer, I wasn't allowed to get paid according to my school, and yet I managed to personally work with athletes until they turned pro. One internship, I was a test cook, and I did many of the projects for my supervisors, coming in before everybody arrives and leaving after everybody leaves. I even taught one of my supervisors how to perform certain methods that he never heard/thought of as well as basic math &amp; statistics skills. When interning as a research assistant, I found the appropriate enzyme and bacteria to use to create real vegan cheese, the french classical way. Another internship had me in the kitchen for 15 hours a day, 7 days a week, and I never gained recognition. My current unpaid internship had me in the office until 8pm last Friday, while my supervisor left early, and they're having me create an algorithm for their website (something that isn't remotely close to what I was supposed to be doing), but at least they started paying me with a bus/subway pass. 

Despite all of these internships being unpaid, people keep telling me, ""Oh, it's a great opportunity, you'll gain experience and you'll be given a job in no time!"", and I've gotten zilch. Just yesterday, after applying for a job as a receptionist with a salary, the CEO emailed me back saying that I was ""over qualified"" and offered me an unpaid freakin' internship. When can one actually get a real decent job, without flipping burgers, that pays something? How can these companies get away with these unpaid ""internships"" even when I'm putting more work than the people that they're paying?! Has anybody else experienced this? Is this normal?"

17ldhk,0,2013-01-30,"Permabanned, in the most ridiculous tribunal case I have ever encountered (please read before pitchforking)",[deleted],leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17ldhk/permabanned_in_the_most_ridiculous_tribunal_case/,"Hey guys, I'm not here to appeal any ban or anything of that nature, all I want as my final request is for you guys to read this and learn from my mistakes.  **I'm certain your time spent reading this will be worth it**

(MANDATORY) FOR THE ~~LAZY~~ FOOLISH:  Link to tribunal case at bottom

Two week ago I got banned for 2 weeks for games that were all ranked, and yea, at 1800 ELO (or any elo that takes semi skill to achieve) when you have a singed who is 1-7 and rushes frozen fists before boots...you get a little upset.  I was set to be unbanned today, was looking at a bright future and setting goals to never get back to the tribunal; this all came to an end when I was permabanned before my other ban had even finished.

I'm not here to say I shouldn't get permabanned, I'm not here to say I think riot is corrupt.  I have said my share of cruel things to people.  In fact everytime I have been banned is for language, never feeding or AFKing etc.

The reason I am here, posting this, is because I would like to see change.  The largest problem with the tribunal and the way players are punished is that it never takes into account good behavior, acts of kindness, sticking up for the little guy.  In all of my case games from my suspensions over the one year I have been playing, they were all, with the exception of maybe 2-3 individual games, ranked solo queue (never duo).  When I am playing with friends, duoqueing, ranked 5s, I say almost nothing ever in chat, honestly, the records would show this.  I consider everything that is not solo queue to be the most leisure and ""fun"" type of league.  I am constantly calming down flamers and ending arguments between players.  I see no reason to EVER under ANY circumstance, be an asshole in anything other than solo queue, and i NEVER am.

So is it ok to be an asshole in solo queue?  Sure, its OK to be, but probably not ideal.  We all have those players who join and do nothing, build like they have never played the game, and refuse to listen to the team.  I get upset when I am playing, busting my ASS, and some other guy just doing nothing and trying to lose the game for us.  There is a DISTINCT difference between someone who is getting killed in lane versus someone who is killing themselves in lane.  I will never call out some guy if he's 0-8 and is CLEARLY playing his heart out.  I will get upset though if I see someone on my team going out of their way to be a bad player.  An example would be when I had a fiddlesticks jungler and every person on our team was incredibly pissed at him, yet I was permabanned over it.  The fiddles made a serious effort to never ult or use his zhonyas.  If I had to guess I would say he went over 20 minutes without actually pressing R.  It was clear to me and the other three players on my team that this fiddlesticks was just being terrible for the sole purpose of wanting to be terrible, he would never respond when we asked him what he was doing.

I think of Solo queue as I would any other competitive sport.  Non ranked is kind of liked a pickup basketball game or w.e other sport you would like to insert there.  In normal games, your goal should be to have fun, there is no penalty for losing so just go out and have a blast!  Ranked however, you are punished, you lose ELO, you lose something that is supposed to be a measure of how good of a player you are.  It has been said over and over again that good players will always win in the long run, and I agree 100% with this statement.  It's like a group project where everyone gets the same grade.  If some dude in your group is just a terrible presenter or has a hard time working with other people, you don't flame at him/her, you help them.  This is who I am, that is what I am all about.  If that same kid in your group decides that instead he wants to bail on everyone on the presentation day...well hes a fucking asshole, and now everyone is gonna suffer because hes an asshole.  

One last thing before I want to share with you guys before I put the final nail in the LoL coffin is a little story.  

I'm down at college, my freshman year.  Had just hit level 30 a few weeks before a tournament was coming up, riot sponsored.  I was extremely excited because I was hoping to find better players than myself and learn and meet people etc.  Well the tournament was run horribly, and it resulted in one person from my school being in a room by himself (this was a LAN event and riots official rules state you must be there in person to be eligible).  So here are like 30 people chilling in a room watching a big screen of the game going on, and I notice something...something was off... The Miss Fortune was literally killing the other team 1v5.  I had someone check up the ELO and sure as shit this guy is 2K, and he is playing a team with people who are not even level 30.  The situation became more troublesome when we all discovered it was from the team with the one kid sitting in a room, locked, by himself.  The tournament organizers were stupid and told the kid he was allowed to have people play who weren't there.  Well TL/DR this kid posted ""free rp"" on some forum, got 4 players to agree to it, they all registered fake names and none of them went to our school (this is not a rule but he claimed in his email that they all attended the school and were gone on break (lol)).  The kid was kicked out by a group vote and he was literally standing outside in tears.  He then rushed to his room and posted this entire thing on reddit and the forums saying his team was kicked from a tournament for being ""too good"".  So here I am, barely level 30, no idea what I'm doing, never HEARD of reddit before, never posted ANYTHING on the forums...and I realized at that point that I needed to do something for the good of the game that I love and will always love; I stepped in.  The team who won had been practicing for hours a day and you could tell, they won without losing a single match.  After the tournament ended they were informed that the kid had posted to /r/leagueoflegends and rioters were getting involved and they would not receive anything for winning.  Needless to say, they were PISSED OFF.  I can't blame them for being angry, you could just tell how much they had practiced to win, you could see it in their eyes (and under them hehe).  So I am just standing here with these tournament organizers and I tell them all, ""Let me handle this"".  And that is exactly what happened.  walking back to my dorm I had no idea how I would fix this problem.  I went online and saw the forum exploding with rage, siding with this fucking asshole kid who is trying to get free stuff.  I'm horrified at all the lies he is posting.  So back at the tournament, the 2K ringer player was streaming while he played.  We hopped on his stream and he had a single viewer, I bet we made his day.  In between a match he went to his facebook and I was able to catch a glimpse of his real name.  Now back in my dorm, through some miracle, I am able to clearly see his facebook name even though it was for only an instant while he was streaming.  I take his name and cross-check it with the registered list of players.  Sure enough, while they planned this whole scam to destory some scrubs at league and pick up their free champion ryze skin and hecarim bundle and free rp, they didn't bother to enter with their real names.  I immediatly took all of this and posted it while waiting for a response.  Sure enough, within no time at all, someone responds to my post confirming everything and the tides immediatly turn.  The Scumbag kid behind the entire thing INSTANTLY deletes all of his posts (edits them all so you can't see what the whole thing was about), and he changes his summoner name.

That day I truly felt like batman.  No one thanked me, no one gave me RP, I wasn't recognized for anything.  But to those five awesome guys who won the tournament, they deserved everything and if I could do ANYTHING AT ALL to help them I made sure to do it.  Eventually they all later contacted me that they got their prizes and thanked me and it felt good, but I explained to them that all I did was untie a knot that shouldn't have been tied in the first place.  (I also did it because I wanted to keep a high reputation for my school because that one kid's attitude and bullshit should not reflect the rest of us).  

*Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So, we'll hunt him, because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight.*

Good luck to everyone on the fields of justice.  If there is one thing I want you to take from all of this it is to stand up for what you believe in, go the extra mile to help your fellow man, and never let assholes stand in the way of your dreams.  My time is up in league, I can never return, my hopes of getting into an undergrad intern at riot has been mutilated.  But for you guys?

I moved away for work with the understanding that we would try a long-distance relationship. One night she gets drunk and sleeps with another guy; things fell apart and we broke up. We talked a little bit after ending things before I decided I needed space; we had no contact for two or three months. She gets in touch again late November and I find the conversation is really nice to have.. We talk about once a week and eventually she comes out to see me for a few days around New Years; it's incredibly easy to fall back into things (it's relevant to note that when she came to see me then I largely had the house to myself; I live with 9 other people). She proposes to keep talking, that she'll look for a summer internship where I'm living (she's in a Master's program right now), etc. all in the interest of building up my trust so as to maybe be able to try an actual relationship again. 

Recently she suggested coming out here for a little over a week during her spring break in March. I agreed to it, because it really would be nice to see her, and I am interested in exploring these things, but I was later struck with a massive degree of anxiety about it and asked her to hold off on arranging her plans. Here's what I wrote up about it while collecting my thoughts: 

""I don't feel totally comfortable with [this girl] coming to stay at my house for 9-10 days in March, not at the present time anyways... I realized last night that it has everything to do with my living situation. If I were in a 1-bedroom, for example, there would not be an issue at all. I can't say that my preoccupation has nothing to do with what my housemates think, because I honestly do have a slight bit of uneasiness over that, but not enough to dissuade me entirely. What hangs me up is the fact that if she were to stay for such a period of time she would doubtlessly meet everyone. More than that, we in the house hang out with high frequency, and so on those occasions I could either not socialize and just stay with [this girl] (something I don't want to have happen for 7+ days), hang out with them while somehow excluding [this girl] (something quite rude to her, so much so that it does not seem fair to invite her to stay if that's how I would act), or perhaps most logically, include her. As unacceptable as those first two options are, this last one puts me off the most, I think... I care about [this girl] and I'm willing to explore things with her, but I'm not open to inviting her into my life in that way, not yet; it just feels premature to me and that makes me feel uncomfortable. I feel bad because I do want to see her, I do want to explore things with her, but it's also true that I feel as I do about my housemates and otherwise the intersection of two worlds. I want to figure out a solution to this."" 

This person hurt me in a very deep way this summer, and I may not ever get to the point where I can trust her enough to be in a relationship again, but the fact remains that I love her sincerely. If it's possible for us to still work together I'd like to try that, but there are just some difficulties in actually executing that... Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

**TLDR: ex-girlfriend wants to rebuild a connection with the hopes of having a relationship again someday. I'm open to that. She wants to come stay with me for a while (something I'm open to in and of itself) which would almost necessarily include meeting/interacting with my housemates/friends I've got here (something I feel very uncomfortable about). What can I do?**

About three months ago he got a job. Recently. I found he has been talking to one of his co worker,who started job as the same day as my BF.lives in Leeds (I did not see he had talked with the other co workers) Because his job. he needs to go up to Leeds (we are staying in London) two days per week. Where he stays in a hotel. Going through his texts I can see they take train from Leeds to where he works together also take train back to Leeds after work. He told me she had asked him go out for drink twice. This first time was the second day they met. Somehow she cancelled it. (He told me this because I was confronting him. othwewise He would have never told me about this,even though he would never mentioned when he called me at the night after he finished his work) He works from home most of time. They talk on the Internet. Some messages that My bf showed me was about job and some personal stuff. Like what they did at the day off. Some messages my bf just closed the conversation windows so I could not be able to check. He says there is nothing to see. I got jealous one day.I really want to get over it so I asked my bf to invite her to go out with us (pretend I was going up Leeds with him) My bf refused to do so the reason was ""if I confirm the exctally day going to Leeds with you. I will ask her to come with us""actually he knew he was going in the same week. We had fight about this. We end up by texting her said""me and my girlfriend coming to Leeds would you like to come for drink with us "" the next day morning. I saw my bf logged in his computer they talked about 5 mins. Then I asked him what was the conversation about. He said its all about if I will come to Leeds. I asked him can I check it. He says the conversation is closed. He switched off his laptop while I insisted to go thought it. I can't understand. All he says about is for his job. But he does not have the other people's number. They are not doing some project together. Does it need to talk every day? My bf thinks I am fucking crazy. Yes.I WAS cheated on two times by my ex. However,I dont think my BF have cheated on me this time. but still it makes me so uncomfortable. makes him so cheap. yesterday. he went to Leeds again. by calling both number I found that they are still taking train to work and go back to Leeds. pls help me

More Advice Needed!,WoodChopper,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17km39/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/,"Hello r/investing! I'm not sure if you remember me, but I posted here a few weeks ago about my money-saving strategies and since then I have read y'all's responses and revised my plan! I really appreciate all the original advice! If you didn't catch the original post, you can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16rcb9/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/). Background: I am a 20 year old college student with two jobs, one that pays from my on-campus housing and meals, and the other that I am using for strictly saving the money that I earn from it. From this job, I earn about $100 bucks a week, which is pretty modest, but I really want to save up to 90% of the money that I make. All my life I have been educated by my father about personal finance, whether from being forced to listen to Clark Howard as a young kid, or him showing me how to open my own bank account and credit card. I am completely debt free. I have absolutely no debt. Not a dime. My college tuition is paid for by scholarships, and my housing and meals are paid for with my Department of Housing job as a Resident Assistant. I have no credit card debt and only primarily use it for gas, snacks, or the occasional night out. So all my debt is already paid down. I'm pretty sure I'll graduate with zero debt. I also have had a credit card for about 3.5 years and use it for all of my general expenses (snacks, restaurants, gas, and nights out). I've never missed a payment and have zero debt on it. I checked my credit score for the first time a few weeks ago and its a 724. Which, for a 20 year old, I feel is pretty solid? Now that I'm finally into some extra money, I want to make my money work for me, rather than just let it sit in a low-interest savings account. So I kind of made up a game plan of what I want to do and when I want to do it. I am just asking for advice on whether these are good ideas, or if there are other options that might help me better!

So here is my plan:

* From my current job and the money that I already have saved, I know that I will have at least $1500 saved up by May. I plan on putting all of this money into a high interest savings account (with a rate of about 1%(Ally Bank), as opposed the the .15% that I am currently making). My purpose for this is to have a good chunk of virtually no-risk liquid cash that I can use for general spending purchases and to serve as my general savings account.

* Luckily, I just found out I landed an internship this summer and I will make about $8500 over the course of 10 weeks, in addition to my other $100 dollar a week job. I want to put at least $5000 of this money into a Roth IRA, which would double as an emergency fund. Yes, taking money out of an IRA seems like a big no-no, but it is actually a very viable emergency fund option.

* And this next step is one that I feel like you guys helped me with the most on my last post. I want to spend a little bit of money on myself as a reward. I have always been an extremely frugal person, but I feel like I need a little reward for all of my hard work. I am looking into buying a used Kawasaki KLR 650, which will run me about $3000. I've never owned my own vehicle, so I'd love to use this reward as a step toward financial independence from my parents.

Okay, Reddit! That's my plan, what to y'all think. Honestly, I am open to absolutely anything. I feel like some more money could go into long term stocks, instead of some other areas that I listed, but I'd just like to here from some more experienced people! I know I'm not making that much money, and after all this work, I may not have a large return, but I just want a game plan that I can test out before I graduate! I'm still young, so I'd rather make all my mistakes now!"
17klnv,12,2013-01-30,"In school, in debt, selling my apartment, trying to budget and track expenses...and overwhelmed. Help?",DavidSaintBreakfast,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17klnv/in_school_in_debt_selling_my_apartment_trying_to/,"I'm 37, broke, in debt, no career (been freelancing for 15 years)...and trying hard to turn things around. I'm in my second semester of a two-year degree in a medical/technology field that is supposed to be growing, and trying to live frugally with a concrete budget for the first time. I'm planning on selling my apartment this spring to pay off my debt and finance my way through the rest of school, a first internship in the field, etc.


There are a few areas where I could really use some advice.

* **Tracking &amp; budgeting**: I like YNAB, but I'm not sure it makes sense for my situation since its philosophy is to budget the previous month's income; My freelancing income won't cover my expenses while I'm in school. I'm making up the difference with help from family and, later, money from my apartment sale. Is there something more suitable or can YNAB work? I'm not a fan of Mint, but I do prefer software (with an Android app) as opposed to a spreadsheet or pen and paper. The simpler and faster it is to use, the more likely I am to keep using it - even if that means a little less precision or less fancy reports and analysis.

* **What to do with debt**: I have $15,000 in credit card debt, half of which is on one card currently defaulted and in collections. The rest is up-to-date with monthly minimums paid. Should I just keep status quo until my apartment (hopefully) sells in a few months? Or call the collection agency and tell them my plan? Try to negotiate? Once the apartment sells, should I just pay them off all at once? Over time? What will help my wrecked credit rating most?

* **Where to go for help**: I was thinking of going to debtors anonymous - not for addiction, but because I thought they might have some good resources. Is that a good idea or frowned upon? And/or are there non-scammy people or agencies out there who just know all this stuff, can look over my situation, work with me on what my choices are and best practices going forward?

Thank you thank you thank you so much!"

    I really screwed the pooch during my degree doing BSc Mathematics at Nottingham Trent University. Partly down to me discovering poker and partly down to laziness. More of Column B than Column A. I ended up graduating without honours, and with a depreciating 'pass' grade. That was July 2011. Leaving uni, I didn't have any job experience, I did some voluntary Admin work right after graduating and last year did some retail work just trying to earn some money. I just got a job working at Lloyds Banking Group as a mortgage processor, which while being an entry-level position, I'm just happy to be in a field related to actuary. Lloyds also have an actuary division, so maybe after completing CT1, 2 and 3, they'd take me on as an intern or something?
    Right now I'm determined to make sure I first and foremost pass the CT1 exam. Having been out of education for close to two years, any advice on how to understand the reading material more thoroughly would be appreciated a ton! I just received the CMP (Combined Materials Pack) from ActEd today, leaving me with just under 11 weeks to study. Do-able?
    I hope I haven't been too vague; any advice at all and I will be forever grateful. "

So, I had a brief stint about 2 years ago as an assistant ITC at my old high school. The county bought a couple hundred iPads and quickly learned that iPads work best with Macs. So like the poorly budgeted morons they are, the county went out and bought a couple hundred iMacs. I’m good with macs, I was good with macs in high school, and I got hired to teach the other ITC how to administrate macs and fix most issues.

Anyway, a few months into the year, one of the teachers reported that some his keyboards and mice weren’t working. I went in after school and took a look at his room.

All of the computers were fine.

Keyboards and mice were working fine, so I told him this and let him know that if it happened again, let me know. The next day, he told me that all of the computers weren’t working, I went in after school and took a look.

Every thing was fine, so I came back the next day during class. Sure enough none of the computer’s mice and keyboards were working. I took one of the computers into my office and plugged it in. Still broken. I waited until after school, when the computers started working again, and started testing things on it. All of the USB ports worked, cables weren’t frayed, etc.

Then I noticed that wifi was on. This was odd since I had set it so that you needed administrative rights to turn wifi on. I tried logging in as root (root password never changed I had to change the administrative password every month) and I got back the most confusing error. It said the password was wrong.

I tried it a few more times and asked my boss if he had changed it.

Nope.

So I logged into my account and checked it out. I changed the root password back to the old one and went back to the classroom. Sure enough, the root password was changed on all of them. I changed all of them back and told the teacher about it and told him that that should fix it.

The next day, all of the machines were back to being broken. I told the teacher that I’ll have to send them all in since I’m out of ideas. Just then, a note popped up on the computer I was sitting at. It said “Be in your office at 12:30”.

Since I really wanted to figure out what was going on, and I had lunch that period anyway, I decided that it would be a good idea to be in my office. At exactly 12:35, a student, lets call him Dave, walked into my office, sat down in the chair next to my desk and pulled out his laptop.

I asked him flat out, “Are you the reason why (Teacher)’s computers haven’t been working?”

His response, being quite cocky I might add, “Yup, and I’m going to show you exactly how I did it, two more ways to do it, and how you can fix it.”

At that point, I just stared at him for a few moments, confused as hell. He broke the awkward silence with, “I heard you say that you were going to send the computers in for repair. I didn’t want to cause you that much of a headache and this was getting boring anyway.”

I told him okay. He pulled out his laptop, opened Apple Remote Desktop and showed me how he was disabling the keyboard and mouse. He also showed me quite a few other things you could do with it and I wrote myself a note to ask the school to buy a copy.

The next puzzle is why the root password was changed. I asked him about it and said nothing, stood up, and gestured for me to follow him. He went into (Teacher)’s room and sat down at an iMac. True to his word, he showed me the way he did it and two other ways to do it, all of which could be done in under 90 seconds. (The methods he used are openly available and can be found with a little bit of google, so I’m not going to post them here. If you really want to know, send me a message.)

I was so impressed that he could do this the I bought him lunch in exchange for him telling me everything else he could do and him agreeing not to change the passwords again and not to tell any of the other students about this. Over lunch, I asked him if he’d be okay being an intern with the ITC and me. He said yes, and now he has my job as part time Mac guru for the school.

TL;DR: Defaults are evil, some students are smart, and there are good people left in the world.  
Edit 2: So it turns out that the student(Dave) is a redditor and he found this post. He's going to try to post some good stories here too.  "

The county bought a couple hundred iPads and quickly learned that iPads work best with Macs. So like the poorly budgeted morons they are, the county went out and bought a couple hundred iMacs. I’m good with macs, I was good with macs in high school, and I got hired to teach the other ITC how to administrate macs and fix most issues.  Anyway, a few months into the year, one of the teachers reported that some his keyboards and mice weren’t working. I went in after school and took a look at his room. All of the computers were fine. Keyboards and mice were working fine, so I told him this and let him know that if it happened again, let me know. The next day, he told me that all of the computers weren’t working, I went in after school and took a look. Every thing was fine, so I came back the next day during class. Sure enough none of the computer’s mice and keyboards were working. 
	I took one of the computers into my office and plugged it in. Still broken. I waited until after school, when the computers started working again, and started testing things on it. All of the USB ports worked, cables weren’t frayed, etc. Then I noticed that wifi was on. This was odd since I had set it so that you needed administrative rights to turn wifi on. I tried logging in as root(root password never changed I had to change the administrative password every month) and I got back the most confusing error. It said the password was wrong. I tried it a few more times and asked my boss if he had changed it. Nope. So I logged into my account and checked it out. I changed the root password back to the old one and went back to the classroom. Sure enough, the root password was changed on all of them. I changed all of them back and told the teacher about it and told him that that should fix it. The next day, all of the machines were back to being broken.

When I graduated, I became an officer in the reserves and decided to include this in my resume. I interviewed with Schlumberger last October, and the only sticking point in the entire process was explaining my situation in the military. Although it wasn't said outright, I think my military involvement and possible active duty responsibilities scared them (and 3 other phone interviews last semester) away.

I'm thinking I'd have better chances in the job market if I simply omitted this information from my resume and cover letter so that I can have an unbiased response from companies. My only hesitation in doing this is that I lack experience in industry-related internships because I was involved in military training for the last two summers of my college career.

Should I keep the reserve status on my resume and keep trying? Or would it be better to leave it off and cover my inexperience with skills/programs I've learned over the past 4 years?"

**Mission Goal**:  Land unkerballed probe(s) on Eve.  Collect data to facilitate planning a Land-And-Return mission to Eve.

**Pilot**: Loshea

**Vehicle Name**: KSS Oregon carrying Pathfinder probes Alpha - Delta

**Mission Launch:** Year 2, Day 158 12h, 34m

**Mission End**: 30th January,Approx 09:03 GMT

&lt;hr&gt;

*Mission Report**:

When the decision was made to begin sending exploratory probes to Eve, our engineering folks quickly devised mission payloads and delivery vehicles
capable of completing their tasks quite efficiently.  L028 was no different. Engineering had decided on an unguided probe, outfitted with only a set of landing legs, a parachute, each type of scientific equipment we had available, solar panels to keep it
running during the day, a batter to give it some time during the night, an antenna, and enough structural bits to hold it all together.  All in all, a very compact, light weight model.  Two weeks before our scheduled launch, Engineering delivered the specs for our Pathfinder probe and it's launch vehicle.  The rocket was nothing fancy.  It carried enough fuel to provide sufficient Delta-V to get to Eve
(with a gravity assit from the Mun), with nothing to spare.  Early specs looked good, tests looked good.

Then we received a herd of interns.  

They were tasked with making some final preparations to the mission vehicle, checking the math, dotting t's and crossing i's.  One of the interns, probably a relative for someone in mission control,
asked if it were ok to make some small modifications to improve the efficiency of the launch vehicle, and their supervisor said ""Sure, as long as you don't screw with the probe"".  To their credit, the 
intern did as he was instructed, and did not mess with the probe.

However, we were all very surprised on launch day to find that the mission craft was not carrying 1 pathfinder probe, as ordered, but 4 of them!  Once we in control got over the shock of seeing 4 probes on the
launch vehicle, we had time to get a drink of coffee.  Then the bigger picture hit us.  We ran back outside to look at the monstrosity our simple little rocket had metamorphosed into in the hands
of this lunatic intern.  It resembled little more than a radio tower with four probes and enough fuel to get a small space station into orbit.

Our launch deadline approached, and we had not time to rebuild the rocket.  As the saying goes, the show must go on.

That's when we found out the mission planners had been using inters as well.  We had a horible phase angle for our Eve approach, and no one in mission control thought we stood a chance of hitting our target.  We were going to scrub
when someone said ""oops"".  A great rumble announced the launch of the ship, the Oregon.  Reluctantly, we all went to our posts to try to do anything we could to keep this mission from ruining our careers.

Liftoff went surprisingly well.  Solid boosters fell away smoothly as their fuel was spent.  Then, at about 10KM, the first liquid fuel tanks separated.  The second set followed about 20KM later, during the gravity turn.  Things looked a little shaky as
the tanks came away, but the craft held together.  LKO was achieved with about 1/3 of the lift-stage fuel remaining.

We let the craft orbit for the better part of a day while waiting for the Mun to reach the correct position.  However, a computer error ignited the main engine again hours early.  While the rocket did manage a slingshot around the Mun, it exited Kerbin's SOI with more
velocity than intended.  It took some time, but we were able to regain control of the craft and jettison the now-empty fuel cell.  Our mission control team ran the numbers, and found that our best bet for achieving mission success was to allow the craft to orbit between Kerbin and eve for several months.

Months later, the interplanetary engines were lit.  Surprisingly, they fired up right away.  Half of the craft's on-board liquid fuel was spent in a corrective burn that set up a very nice intercept with Eve's SOI.  The only downside was that the approach would be a little high (about 65GM).  

Once the Oregon entered Eve's SOI, the crafts attitude was adjusted to align for the orbital burn.  16 hours later, the engines were lit, and the remaining fuel brought the craft into a rather steep 65GM x 19GM orbit of Eve.

At this point, the craft switched to using its ion engines.  over the course of a couple of burns (several days apart as the craft orbited high above Eve), Oregon's periapsis was brought to just within Eve's outer atmosphere.

As aerobraking began on the first pass, the first.  One probe was deployed during each subsequent aerobraking pass.

The third and forth were deployed during the second pass.  Pleasantly, 3 of 4 probes survived their fall to the planets surface (sans legs, which broke off during aerobraking).  Score one for our engineering team.

The interns had hoped the Oregon would have sufficient fuel to return to Kerbin for reuse, but the combination of bad phase angle and computer glitches made this impossible, and the decision was made to scuttle her.  Our mission controller cackled maniacly as he sent the destruct signal to the Oregon as she made one final aerobraking pass thorugh
Eve's atmosphere.

I moved around a lot when I was a kid (every two years - Canada, several places in California, and Korea). 


I always excelled in academic settings but almost never in social settings. I was an Honor Roll student, 4.0 till junior year, till I moved to Korea where I didn't know the language and flunked my senior year. By this time, I was no longer ""smart"" or ""cool."" Basically turned into an anti-social washout.

I went to community college in the states, and smoked a lot of weed. Met some new people but had to come back to Korea because no money. Got into a crappy school and am maintaining 4.2 GPA. Again, with very little friends.

Never had a boyfriend but enjoy going clubbing. Hate talking to guys, but I get turned on very easily, which is probably why making out in the dark is perfect. I like getting shit faced and being numb.

Parents fucking hate each other. Older brother suffers from depression, forced to serve in the Korean military. Little brother is 13. Pretty sure he suffers from depression too. But most importantly, I hate all of them, deeply. If I could, I would never see them again.


Haven't been seeing friends at all. Used to be social 1~2 years ago, but not anymore. Don't have the energy to meet anyone, talk about shit.


Currently doing an (online) internship at a newspaper joint. Don't feel like doing shit. I've been secretly drinking every day in my room for the past week. 


So would you say this is depression? Narcissism? Anti-social personality disorder? Anxiety? 

Edit: i guess it sounds more like depression, which i guess can be cured through several different methods. Thanks again :)"

I have helped him get through his medical school stuff by helping to feed him and give him day-to-day supplies as he lives of his loan money and has no family to support him.  If you are not familiar with the high costs of med school and the time is requires, it is like having a job in that is occupies most of your time but it costs an insane amount of money.  We live in Utah (though we are NOT Mormon).  He is almost done with school.  He has worked very hard and now is getting rewarded for it by having well-recognized residency programs match with him.  He pretty much knows he will get into his top place.  The two places he is going to choose from are in California.  One is UCSF and the other is Stanford.  He also may choose to stay in Utah, but that won't be as good for his future.  He will finally have a salary as a resident which will be nice for him.  However, California is notoriously expensive to live in and hard to move to.  These places are even more so.  He has been a very good boyfriend to me and I hope to marry him someday since we have a good relationship that I can see being even better over time.

I live with family right now because I was got my masters in 2011 and was unfortunately unemployed after getting no offers from internships and no other jobs would take me on while I was in school with internships anyway.  I finally got a job in May, though it is not high-paying.  It is paying the bills so far though I still can't get out of my parents' house at this point.  I had a lot of debt pile up from not being employed.  I tried to help him as best as I could though as he definitely needed it.  I tried to do odd jobs and use the tiny bit of money I inherited.  Is still didn't change the fact that I was in deep debt though.  For now though, I am getting paid and I have started paying on the student loans I have deferred for so long.  I need a car where I live since our transit is pathetic if you don't live in our downtown area.  That of course adds up.  Overall, I now work hard to pay for a car, student loans, the loan I had to take up while unemployed, and then helping him.  I have so much debt it isn't funny.  I can't ask family for help because they already helped me as much as they could.  It doesn't make things any better after being in a major accident like I was Xmas eve and having to get another car and deal with insurance going way up.  I know my boyfriend appreciates my help though and he has been there for me in other ways.  I have lightly told him that I have to be careful about how I am helping him since my financial situation is not good. 

With all this background information in mind, I am now in a tight place.  He wants me to move to California with him but I have no idea how it can happen.  Utah's pay and costs of living are low compared to the rest of the nation, let alone Cali.  He will go out there and will have pay from his residency and may be gone a bit obviously from having to commit to it.  For those unfamiliar with medicine, residency does not pay that much.  I have been trying to scope out work around there and it isn't looking good.  I went to school in a field that is very hard to break into and this looks tough.  It will probably be better than where we are in the long term aspect.  I still need a job one way or the other if I go out there.  I know to move somewhere you have to have money saved up but I have nothing to save.  I am trying to get a side job to help with this but I still have no idea how this can happen.  

My boyfriend keep asking me where I think he should go and naturally, I want  what's best for him but I tell him that I am not sure.  I don't know what to do though as far as telling him no matter how much I want to go with him to California, I have no idea how I am going to be able to.  I want to continue our relationship and move with him as I do love him but with no money and no job where we will go, it isn't looking optimistic.  I work hard to help fix my finances and am already trying to do even more to help but it may not be enough to get there.  How do I tell him this?  I would do a LDR with him if I had to wait but those are so hard to do when you are not sure how you are going to be able to get to where they are one day.  I just am upset that I may risk this relationship over my finances.  If you could please advise me, that would be great.  Sorry if this seemed repetitive, it just has been weighing on my mind for a long time and after seeing how much I am trapped with money and how difficult it is to move and live in California and also realizing the time where he has to make a decision is soon, I finally had to do something.  Where do I even begin?"

I would take a hit here, float through a do-nothing day (read as: a day I should have been studying for my engineering degree), feel myself coming down {or force myself to come down from a huge high with a cigarette} and smoke again, telling myself that I have plenty of time to study for my upcoming test or class lecture or homework, and never do it, just watch cat videos or hulu for 3+ hours until i was coming down again.

Fast forward through a girlfriend of 1.4 years, leaves me, i get depressed, do my own thing for a while not in school, meet a cute girl, get her into trees, have fun, and go through a solid 1.5 weeks with her not smoking. I just had my wisdom teeth removed, then the following week we went on vacation with her super strict sister and brother-in-law, so it was a forced break.

As soon as we got back to my apt after that ""vacation"", we toked up. When she started coming down, we realized the new semester was only about a week away, and she said to me, ""we really should quit, it certainly affected my grades, and I don't think you did so hot either last semester."" And she was right, I knew it had been getting in the way, but I didn't want to accept the reality that I had been smoking away of my future as an engineer geared to save the world from itself. [long story]. So I incidentally failed that previous semester, so close to progressing, and decided I needed a change. I quit cold turkey with her (tbh, she didn't smoke as much or as long as I did, it wasn't that hard for her to quit, she didn't have access to dealers or devices, where as I had the pipe, and connections). So we went a few weeks without it, getting things done towards financial aid, and internships, and job security, and then the semester came and we were doing great.

Then I got high with a friend from work after i got arrested from some bullshit traffic warrant, that I paid, and she waited up all night for me to get released from holding. [lazy prick of an arresting officer couldn't wait 10 minutes for her to arrive with my credit card, but could waste 10 minutes filling out booking paperwork at shift-change time]

Anyway, I feel bad for getting high that one night, but at the same time, I didn't really want to quit in the first place, I just did with her because it really was the right thing to do, but I fell awful for stumbling.

17juoz,4,2013-01-30,At what point do I stop going to therapy?,guessimok,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/17juoz/at_what_point_do_i_stop_going_to_therapy/,"I have been avoiding counting the number of therapy sessions I've been, along with the money I've spent. But I just did and I was a little surprised at just how much it was and how many times I've been. I kept track at first, but then I just decided to proceed without worrying about it. Especially since, for various reasons, I went through some life changes, and we took breaks for illness and holidays. This is the first therapist I have gone to see more than once. She is an intern trainee, and she is working for me, she is helping. The last time I went, I didn't expect much and she dragged some stuff out of me and said some profound stuff to me that I can't forget. I almost feel like it's helping more and more every time. I can afford to keep going, but at what point am I ""better""?


I know a lot of my problems are related to PTSD and I know that's something you can't just recover from. I also know there's such a thing as being addicted to the emotional support and attention you get from therapy, which is kind of fucked up too. I also know that a lot of my problems are perfectly normal and not a severe disorder that requires hardcore therapy.


This is what I've taken away from my experiences with my therapist - I'm a survivor of a bad childhood, I have an inclination to self-blame, but she thinks I'm intelligent and I have good instincts. She likes that I like to make people laugh, but she commented that I try to take things lightly while I also get depressed because I really, really care about people. I have expressed wanting to die in conjunction with an inability to do the job myself (someone posted recently about being passively suicidal, I can really relate.) I have tried to learn to trust her. One thing that led me to therapy is all my issues with personal relationships, how I hurt people I love and sabotage happy things. So it means a lot to be able to be honest with someone. She makes me not want to focus on my shame, whenever I do in our sessions, she is like a WMD against the negative voice in my head.


So the idea of never seeing her again after a certain point gives me some dread. If she's that important to me, can I just walk away? I've been taking this so seriously, can I just stop now and move forward with my life. Is it possible to finish therapy? I don't think I could find another therapist. And also, since she's an intern, she'll probably be finishing her program at a certain point. Then what do I do? I suppose I should talk about all this with her, but I needed to get it out."

After playing a few games of pool and drinking, we started talking to the girls adjacent to us on the other pool table. My friends and I (3 guys) bring the 2 girls back to our friends place to get 420 friendly.

My friend and I were competing for one girl whom was acting very promiscuous (I was drunk and in a dry spell; he had just had a fight with his girlfriend and asked me not to let him slip up tonight). In the end my friend ended up with her in his room, despite my warnings and being the obvious cockblock, both for his and my sake. 

Just for the record, I'm not upset that he was the better man. I am upset because the man pulled out his recorder and played the tune of My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion. He then followed this up by playing his harmonica for shits and giggles.

Back at my apartment, feeling slightly defeated, I decided to see if television could give me a quick laugh before I call it a night. 

I turned on the TV, and was immediately greeted by Daniel Tosh shoving some giant paper fingers into a giant paper vagina.

At first, I grew wide eyed and began to feel the rage climb up. But then, as I continued to watch Tosh jam this cardboard index and middle finger into this vagina, held by these interns grinning like schoolkids, I fell into a giant fit of laughter.

I suddenly had the thought that this show was just mocking my failure, and that made me smile more than anything else. 

Although I have lost faith in humanity, I'm sort of looking forward to listening to his guilty rant tomorrow.

17jtmu,7,2013-01-30,Questions regarding systems programming,MyCSthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17jtmu/questions_regarding_systems_programming/,"Sorry for the terribly unspecific title, but I have several questions regarding systems programming.  First, I'll start with my situation:

I just started my junior year this semester at a school whose CS program isn't anything special.  Low level programming is what intrigues me the most, so it's what I decided to focus on.  During the school year I work 30 hours a week, along with a credit load ranging from 15-17 and during the summers I would have family related commitments along with work, so I haven't had much time to start any significant projects.  Right now, I'm on medical leave from work, so I finally have time to start a project, which I decided would be to create an operating system (since that's what systems programming is about), so currently I'm reading Tanenbaum's *Modern Operating Systems*, after reading K&amp;R of course.  I knew this was a large task, so I gave myself the deadline of having something presentable by the end of summer, in time for winter internships.  However, because of some recent family events (not involving me, but affecting me), I need an internship this summer.  So here are my questions:

1) First of all, is systems programming a field with a good job market, so I don't have to worry about graduating with no job outlook?

2) Are there even internships for systems programming, if so what would companies should I look into, or what keywords should I look for on websites like glassdoor.

3) Obviously operating systems are something I should be familiar with, and networking I believe, but what else should I look into?

4) Now for the big question, with my given situation do I have any shot at an internship this summer?  I don't any part of the OS coded, I was planning on reading the book and doing the exercises, then coding.  Currently I've only covered chapters 1 &amp; 2, which are introduction and processor scheduling respectively.  Should I start creating the scheduler before I move onto the next section?  Lastly, if I do start creating each part, how much weight would it have on a resume?  Would I be better off starting on another project, if so what would that be?

Sorry about the wall of text, just have a lot going on, haha."

When I graduated, I became an officer in the reserves and decided to include this in my resume. I interviewed with Schlumberger last October, and the only sticking point in the entire process was explaining my situation in the military. Although it wasn't said outright, I think my military involvement and possible active duty responsibilities scared them (and 3 other phone interviews last semester) away.

I'm thinking I'd have better chances in the job market if I simply omitted this information from my resume and cover letter so that I can have an unbiased response from companies. My only hesitation in doing this is that I lack experience in industry-related internships because I was involved in military training for the last two summers of my college career.

Should I keep the reserve status on my resume and keep trying? Or would it be better to leave it off and cover my inexperience with skills/programs I've learned over the past 4 years?"

More Advice Needed!,WoodChopper,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17jjhq/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/,"Hello r/personalfinance! I'm not sure if you remember me, but I posted here a few weeks ago about my money-saving strategies and since then I have read y'all's responses and revised my plan! I really appreciate all the original advice! If you didn't catch the original post, you can find it [here.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16rasa/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/)
Background:I am a 20 year old college student with two jobs, one that pays from my on-campus housing and meals, and the other that I am using for strictly saving the money that I earn from it. From this job, I earn about $100 bucks a week, which is pretty modest, but I really want to save up to 90% of the money that I make. All my life I have been educated by my father about personal finance, whether from being forced to listen to Clark Howard as a young kid, or him showing me how to open my own bank account and credit card.  I am completely debt free. I have absolutely no debt. Not a dime. My college tuition is paid for by scholarships, and my housing and meals are paid for with my Department of Housing job as a Resident Assistant. I have no credit card debt and only primarily use it for gas, snacks, or the occasional night out. So all my debt is already paid down. I'm pretty sure I'll graduate with zero debt. I also have had a credit card for about 3.5 years and use it for all of my general expenses (snacks, restaurants, gas, and nights out). I've never missed a payment and have zero debt on it. I checked my credit score for the first time a few weeks ago and its a 724. Which, for a 20 year old, I feel is pretty solid?
Now that I'm finally into some extra money, I want to make my money work for me, rather than just let it sit in a low-interest savings account. So I kind of made up a game plan of what I want to do and when I want to do it. I am just asking for advice on whether these are good ideas, or if there are other options that might help me better!

So here is my plan:

* From my current job and the money that I already have saved, I know that I will have at least $1500 saved up by May. I plan on putting all of this money into a high interest savings account (with a rate of about 1%([Ally Bank](http://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/?INTCMPID=HP_NAV_SVG#tabs=rates)), as opposed the the .15% that I am currently making). My purpose for this is to have a good chunk of virtually no-risk liquid cash that I can use for general spending purchases and to serve as my general savings account.

* Luckily, I just found out I landed an internship this summer and I will make about $8500 over the course of 10 weeks, in addition to my other $100 dollar a week job. I want to put at least $5000 of this money into a Roth IRA, which would double as an emergency fund. Yes, taking money out of an IRA seems like a big no-no, but it is actually a very viable emergency fund option.

* And this next step is one that I feel like you guys helped me with the most on my last post. I want to spend a little bit of money on myself as a reward. I have always been an extremely frugal person, but I feel like I need a little reward for all of my hard work. I am looking into buying a used [Kawasaki KLR 650](http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/photos/2009models/2009-Kawasaki-KLR650e.jpg), which will run me about $3000. I've never owned my own vehicle, so I'd love to use this reward as a step toward financial independence from my parents.

Okay, Reddit! Thats my plan, what to y'all think. Honestly, I am open to absolutely anything. I feel like some more money could go into long term stocks, instead of some other areas that I listed, but I'd just like to here from some more experienced people! I know I'm not making that much money, and after all this work, I may not have a large return, but I just want a game plan that I can test out before I graduate! I'm still young, so I'd rather make all my mistakes now!"
17jjah,1,2013-01-29,Discovery Program (?) General Questions..,Chris5938,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/17jjah/discovery_program_general_questions/,"There is a discovery program, that firms do, which I guess they are taking an interest in Freshman students at my school, since there are so little of us. But, it's basically the firm flies a student out across the country, (everything is paid for.) and is trained for one week.

If they like you for that one week, you have a summer internship, which is a paid internship (IIRC). 

I'm wondering if anyone has did this program, and what were some of the things you did? 

I'm now located in NYC @ Pace University, where I guess it is targeted for upper level firms, and the Big 4. Beta Alpha Psi's aim is to have every student that graduates with a degree, get into one of the higher firms, and I guess they are pretty successful.

The senate judiciary committee will also be hearing S.150 (the Feinstein AWB), S.22 (on gun show background checks) and S.33 (companion bill to the house standard capacity mag ban) at some point, though probably not tomorrow.  Either way, they'll be important in deciding whether that legislation gets to the floor.

[Harry Reid is going to do everything he can to get anti-gun bills to the senate floor](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2983193/posts).  This is a bad sign, as it suggests he thinks he might have the votes to get it passed.  We have to push.

[LINK to meeting announcement and webcast.](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=8ddfce272f36de81e62e30d8153a7d3a)

After you've [called your own reps tomorrow](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml) (which is still priority #1 and which you should do every day), consider contacting members of the Senate Judiciary Committee (especially if they are your reps).  If you only have time to contact one additional person, contact the chair (phone number below).  This should be done ideally between the hours of 9AM and 10AM, before the hearing, but if you miss it, do it any time in the day tomorrow.

Be polite, and be brief.  

""Hi, I'm calling to encourage Senator [X] to oppose any new gun control legislation.""

They will almost certainly ask for your zip or location.

""I'm telephoning the Senator with respect to his/her capacity as a member of the Judiciary committee, where I am not represented by my senator and where s/he is making decisions that affect all of us.""

Every intern I've spoken to says your message still gets sent along.

I have it all. I have never had an opportunity denied to me. I have a loving family, loyal friends, a caring boyfriend, and an excellent education. I have traveled fairly extensively, pursued internships and volunteer work, and have generally been considered as ""the girl who is going places.""

Yet, here I sit. Six months after graduating from my university I feel absolutely paralyzed. In. Every. Aspect. Of. My. Life. I read through job descriptions and make plans to apply, but don't. I consider calling up a friend, but settle for Hulu instead. I try to wake myself up by creating lists of things to accomplish for the day, or keep to a routine to ensure I get things done, but nothing seems to help. Every measure I take in order to gain control is thwarted; by me.

Laziness, apathy, indifference, whatever you want to call it; I'm feeling it. I wish there was an obvious way to break this spell.

I have been an integral part of the creative side of all the marketing and advertising projects that my groups have worked on for class, and I have produced the following content

1. The packaging for a cereal box (Special K Caramel Delight)

2. A commercial for a cereal (Special K Caramel Delight)

3. A storyboard for a cereal (Special K Caramel Delight)

4. A Print ad for a Turkish Home entertaining product (Golden Age Collection)

5. A Website for a Turkish Home entertaining product (Golden Age Collection

6. A commercial for a Turkish Home entertaining product (Golden Age Collection

7. A Radio Advertisement for a Turkish Home entertaining product

8. A Web Application for a Turkish Home entertaining product (Golden age collection)


I also have marketing plans relating to the campaigns

In addition to this, I have also created the following for AMA

1. A New website
2. Hand outs for use in classes
3. Print ads in the form of posters for a scavenger hunt


Should any, or all of these be included in a portfolio? Also to expand on a portfolio, what should I include? I wanted to work for a smaller advertising agency and be able to have input on a lot of different advertising and marketing activities. Should I just make up advertisements, or full advertising campaigns? Is there anyone on campus who would typically want free student work? I'm meeting with my school's internship office this Thursday, but I want to get a feeling for whether I'll be able to land an advertising internship or not. (If I can't I'll definitely be able to get one in another area of marketing). I can submit samples of most of the work I have done, if anyone wants to see it.  "

My girlfriend and I have been together for three years next week. My dad has a pretty nice job as an architect, we live in a nice house, nice car, my parents are still together, we sometimes go on vacations, I have a reasonable allowance. I am not super-spoilt, but I do recognize my life is easier than that of a lot of people I know. I have never, ever, judged somebody based on how wealthy they are, and it does not affect my social relations with anyone.

My girlfriend however, whom I love dearly with all my heart, lives with her divorced mother. Her dad is very reluctant to pay child support, they live in a rather small appartment. Her mother is verbally agressive towards her (not towards me). You get the picture.

We are both studying at the same university (but in different studies), relatively normal students.

Over recent years, my girlfriend sometimes had trouble with the big financial 'gap' between us. My parents would take her with us on holidays and go to places and restaurants. She seems to interpret all of this as a sort of 'showing off'. She suspects my mother of giving hints, so to speak, of showing how much more we can afford. I, for one, am quite certain my mom loves my girlfriend as well, and that she would never want to bully her in this way.

GF thinks things will never work out between us in the long run, because of huge financial differences. At home, her divorced parents constantly argue about money. She tries to spend as few as possible, not to hear the same screaming about how much it costs to keep her in uni every time again. She refuses to take any and all money from me.

Now, my parents announced to my brother and myself that we would be going to Russia in the summer to see Moscow and St. Petersburg. However, GF can't come along, because she has an internship for school at that time. It's just another drop for her. She hates the fact that we can afford to go on holidays that she wants to do as well. She says I choose the money over her. She says I choose family over her.

Dear reddit, I love my girlfriend like nobody else. How do I overcome this problem? Inb4 ""dump the bitch she crazy""
I need a constructive solution, not a run-away plan.

Then, during a lunch meeting with a banker, my period drenched through my freshly changed tampon, sanitary pad AND even soaked my underwear. Then last night, my 13 year old dog that I had since I was 9 years old died while I was stroking her in her sleep. I had to call a vet to come collect her body because there was nowhere I could bury her. I had to watch as he lifted her broken looking body and stuff her into a black garbage bag. He promised that he would bury her somewhere near the clinic but the sight of her in the black bag was just too much for me. Both my siblings are abroad, so I fell asleep crying alone last night, then this morning I woke up crying again. Now I'm huddled in the office bathroom crying my eyes out and I can't stop. I don't even have the choice of taking the day off because I'm only an intern and interns aren't given leave days. Nobody in the office knows what happened and they think my eyes are swollen thanks to the infection and not from crying. My phone and computer's wallpaper is a picture of my dog and every time I look at it, I start to cry again. I can't do my work today and I'm afraid they might cancel my internship because of this. I did try to hold it in and sit at my table to work but I would run back to the bathroom to cry every time I thought about my dog, which is about every 15-30 minutes. I have another 6 hours of work to get through before I can go home. How do I make the tears stop??"

",GrayPenguin,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/17npbc/sometimes_its_the_procedures_not_the_people_that/,"The summer of 2011 I was doing an IT helpdesk internship at a rather large semiconductor company. 

I get a ticket that seems easy enough. ""Not able to load access database."" Probably user error so I put it in my queue and head to the user's desk. 

Apparently, all new hires to the engineering department have to go through training. This curriculum was put together quite a few years ago and was built on top of Access forms for reasons that either nobody could explain or nobody would own up to. They had been around so long, in fact, that nobody actually knew where they came from or who made them. But at the time, I did not know this. 

When I got to the desk, I saw that the user was running Win 7 and Office 2010 on a brand new laptop. I asked them what the problem was and they said that Access threw up an error when trying to load the file. So I ask them to show me how they would load the file. They correctly browse to the file and try to open, and lo and behold, an error. 
""This database was saved in the Microsoft Access 2.0 file format."" Oh ok...wait, what?? 

This critical company training, without which a new employee could not continue to work in the company, was done in Access 2.0 and never updated. 

Well, no problem. Naive me makes a copy of the mdb(!) file and tries to do an import. Doesn't work. Not even a little bit. 

So, I spend the next two hours installing XP Compatibility mode, installing access 2.0 in that (which doesn't have an installer...just a dll file!) and running that in Windows 95 compatibility inside of the XP vm.

To his credit he vowed to never repeat the joke.

Not sure how insightful this is, but thought I would share my thoughts."

Every morning it takes a herculean effort to simply open my email inbox in fear of what might be in there. When I get a voicemail about a job, I get sick to my stomach thinking about calling back. My pulse doubles, butterflies and everything. I get emails and then stress for days about what to type. I'll wait so long that I convince myself it's too late to reply. 

I've probably lost half a dozen job opportunities because I can't communicate. I've hinted at what it's like to my parents and I get the impression that they think it's stupid, I'm just lazy and making excuses. 

I managed to get an internship a while back, but I botched it because the job required a lot of phone meetings and people management. So I lost that reference. I'm worried that even if I do manage to get a job, I'll get fired. 

I just want to feel like a normal person. "

17ncoo,0,2013-01-31,I hope reddit still likes cats,verbose_man,Jokes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/17ncoo/i_hope_reddit_still_likes_cats/,"A family of tabby cats walks into a talent agency run by a bulldog and his intern. The family -- a tomcat, his visibly pregnant mate, and two younger cats -- all take a bow, and the tomcat introduces his family to the bulldog.

""We're a travelling variety show looking for some representation. Do you think your agency could help us?""

The intern, a chihuahua, begins to nod and speak, but the bulldog cuts her off, chomping on a smoldering cigar.

""We only represent the best here. We'll need to see a performance of your act before we can take you as a client.""

""We don't have a videotape prepared,"" says the tomcat, ""but we're prepared to demonstrate the big number at the end of our show for you here in this office, if you'd like.""

The bulldog and chihuahua exchange a glance, and the bulldog sighs, puffing a cloud of tobacco smoke to one side.

""Okay, okay. You get one take. This had better be good.""

The family of tabby cats rearrange themselves, and look expectantly at the tomcat, as though waiting for his cue. He nods quickly and the two kittens run at each other. The male extends his front paws as his sister vaults into a handstand on top of them, spreading her rear to expose her glistening vulva. This display of gymnastics attracts the attention of the tomcat, who sticks his nose and mouth firmly between her legs, while the pregnant cat begins to wail a few bars of a vaudeville song that the intern is unfamiliar with, but the bulldog has heard once or twice. The tomcat screeches, spraying urine and pheromones all over the pregnant mother before displaying his now-erect penis, bristling with sharp spines. Both the bulldog and chihuahua are speechless at this jowl-dropping display, and the cigar falls to the floor.

On a downbeat in the mother's wailed song, the tomcat opens the door as the two kittens scramble to the side of their mother, singing harmony on the line ""everybody wants to be a cat."" A larger-than-average doberman comes through the open door and sits in the middle of the scene. The tomcat bends forward, caressing the tip of his tumescent, barbed penis and sucking with his mouth at the crotch of the doberman. Meanwhile, the two kittens grab the distending walls of the pregnant cat's cervix as she gives birth to a litter of four kittens, one after the other, right on the floor of the talent agency. The doberman, seeing the sudden shock of birth on the mother's face, licks his chops as his turgid penis bursts out of its sheath, shiny and red as a tomato. With this, the chihuahua intern shivers a little as the bulldog tries to regain his composure while fighting a small twinge of jealousy at the size of the doberman's member.

The doberman approaches the mother, while the tomcat begins to hump the placenta like a horny teenager on a dirty sofa cushion. The two kittens who'd assisted with the birth back away, making wide gestures with their paws at their postpartum mother's gaping vagina. The doberman rocks his hips back and forth, rolling his swelling penis against the umblical cords like violin strings to the beat of the winded mother's song. The two oldest kittens pick up the tune for their mother as she picks each of the newborns up and sucks the fluids from their fur. The bulldog behind his desk leans over and whispers to his intern, ""that part makes sense, at least.""

The tomcat breaks away from the placenta as the mother finishes cleaning her infants, then begins raking the barbs on his twitching penis against several boils on the back of his mate's flank. One of them bursts, spilling pus down her coat and onto the floor. The doberman scoops up the male kitten from the side of the room and shoves his giant cock through the cat's virgin rectum and all the way out through his mouth. With the head of his penis dripping and exposed, the doberman takes aim at one of the newborn cats and penetrates its tiny vulva, making her seconds-old eyes pop open and roll back in her head. With this, the doberman comes hard, biting the head off the infant and dripping semen down to the ground. The bulldog and intern are aghast, recoiling back into their chairs.

The oldest female holds the exposed esophagus of the deceased infant, defecating lumps into the wound and puffing the body up like a balloon. The mother cat snatches the body up, licking the fur, and slowly sliding the body in and out of her still-gaping snatch. The other newborns instinctively begin to lap up the mixture of pus and semen on the floor like milk from a saucer, trading with each other in a show of generosity. The tomcat, still erect and pulsing with excitement, grabs the chihuahua from her seat by the back of the neck, and begins penetrating her unaroused mound while singing about making pussies purr. The bulldog is frozen with shock and horror as his intern's body betrays her.

Finally, the mother's masturbatory lump becomes too much for her and she shudders, coming hard and squeezing the feces from the decapitated body of her child. The tomcat, the mother, and the doberman all harmonize on the last note of the song as the tomcat climaxes inside the chihuahua. As the tomcat pulls his spined phallus from the raw and bloody canine sex, the chihuahua's guilty orgasm adds one more note to the song as the group finishes together.

Everything is silent, except for the low licking of the three surviving infants against the sticky texture on the floor. The group takes a bow as the chihuahua passes out. With this, the bulldog gasps, reaching a trembling paw for the dropped cigar. He replaces the stogie in his mouth, not seeming to notice the dark dribble of blood-darkened interspecies semen on the tip.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, the bulldog is finally able to force some words from his mouth.

""Well, what the hell do you call that act?""

The tomcat's eyes sparkle.

Yesterday we got into an argument on facebook where we started talking shit to each other and when he said my ""quip"" took too long, I remarked that I was ""busy being a productive member of society"". The joke continued from there, him attacking me for being an intern, and I attacked him for being a janitor at a really nice historical site. 

He got extremely offended and basically called me a stuck up cunt and said some other harsh things. I was stunned at the time because I sincerely did not think he would take me seriously, but apparently I hit a sore spot with him. As soon as I realized it, I FB-messaged him (since he was at work at the time) and apologized and told him I didn't know it would upset him and I was just busting his balls. He promptly told me to go fuck myself.

After about an hour or two I texted him, thinking that calling would be a bad idea since he was mad, and apologized repeatedly -- I told him I was sorry and that I don't think less of him or his job in any way and that I actually think he has a cool job (although cleaning toilets and stuff sucks). He told me at a certain point jokes like that become an assessment of someone's worth, so I continued to apologize and said I would never have said it if I thought it would hurt his feelings or that he would take it seriously. Eventually he just said ""I hear you"" and that was the end of the conversation.

I told my boyfriend to keep out of this and explained that I really was sorry and that I had apologized to his friend. He said that what his friend said was pretty harsh but he also understood why he got upset for what I said. And, like I said, I told him I had apologized repeatedly, etc. etc.

Now I feel a bit awkward. My boyfriend's birthday is tomorrow. I'm making a cake and we're all going out to a bar. I had told his friend that I would buy him an apology drink if he didn't hate me, but I'm honestly kind of hurt at what he said to me even though I know it was a reaction to what he perceived as something really mean. 

I literally haven't argued with anyone like this since I was a freshman in college. I'm not a judgmental person and I would never say something intentionally hurtful.

How do I handle this situation with some semblance of grace? I really don't want to make my boyfriend's birthday awkward, but outside of buying a drink, I've apologized and I don't really know what else I can say. I'm pretty hurt by what he said and that he thinks I would judge him for something like a janitorial job, but I don't expect he'll apologize for what he said. 

**tl;dr: Got into an argument with my boyfriend's best friend on fb because a joke was perceived as something offensive. Apologized repeatedly but tomorrow is my boyfriend's birthday and I feel awkward about the whole situation and don't want to talk about it. How do I avoid an awkward situation if his friend is still mad at me?**"

She found someone that she ""clicked"" with. Need advice please. ",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17my5x/my_gfbest_friend_f21_highschool_sweetheart_of/,"
Thank you so much for anyone that gives me advice, just posting this helps me cope with the issue. 

We have known each other since tenth grade of high school and we were best friends for about a year before we decided to give each other a chance to be a couple. I had been with 3 not serious relationships (kissing only) and I was her first boyfriend. She is the sweetest most caring person I had ever met, looking out for others more than she did her self .We promised each other that no matter what we would always be best friends. I go to community college and have a part time job, admittedly I haven't had the best grades but I recently reach a 3.0 gpa while at the same time looking for a better job and she goes to a 4 year private university and is fortunate enough to not have to work and is currently doing an internship. 

Time wasn't  always on my hands, we limited seeing each other to two days a week without the knowledge of her parents and  because her parents didn't let her do weekends. Speaking of her parents, her mother never liked me when we started dating but had softened up over the years and her dad was cool. She was my first, and I was her first intimate relationship. She trusted me just as much as I trusted her, we would cry in each others shoulder when times were tough but we also shared beautiful moments with each other. Her friends were also my friends so we hung out together all the time.

  I was always the confident one, the one that kept on pushing her forward and she was my foundation that kept me strong. I regret ever wanting to break up with her about a year ago because I felt ""trapped"" because she was always talking about living together and talked about kids and I wanted to see how it felt being single again. We convinced each other to give it another go, a lot changed over those months inside of me, I  knew for a fact that she was the one. 

She is graduating next year and I'm still stuck in community college pursuing my dream. About a month ago she started her spring semester and also said she wanted to stop having sex sex because she felt terrified every time her period came late, I felt hurt but I told her it was okay and that there were other ways of being intimate.  She told me she made a new friend that I'll refer to as ""bob"". She met bob in one of her classes, same graduating class and such. She has had guy friends before at school so I just teased her to be careful and not to forget who she was with because she didn't have many friends there and I wanted her to be happy.

Last week she came over, and started talking about how she wasn't romantically in love with me and how she loved me but in a different way. I was speechless. Out of everyone I knew  including me self I never expected those words to come from her. I was blindsided, we had just hung out with our friends for her 21st and the thought of her celebrating with me and feeling like that crushed me. My world came crashing on me out of nowhere. I tried reasoning with her that we should have another shot, because I had felt that way before too and I over came it. I told her to sleep it put and rethink her position. The next day she said she had made up her mind and he said she wanted to be with me. I was happy, I started doing research on how to give out relationship that spark, what we would do for valentines day and I just had so many good ideas. 

The next time we met she said she didn't know how to feel, I got it out of her that when she met bob when the semester started and that she looked at her a certain way. She stopped having sex with me because the thoughts  of her accidentally becoming  pregnant and  not being sure if she would be happy with me scared her and  especially if we moved in together or married (which was a few years down the road, we hadn't even thought of planning it and that mind you she brought it up the most)

We both made each other grow spiritually, sexually and emotionally.  Now I feel used, lonely, and angry to some extent that she left me for another potential guy. The worst part is that she is my best friend, the person I cried to and shared my feelings with and now it hurts when I see her and we do things we used to do and even when I don't see her it hurts. 

Should I forget her and never see her again?

Should I still hang out with her and our friends? 

Should I wait and see if comes back to me?

Should I fight for her?

Deep down I feel she still has feelings for me and I just have to remind her of why we fell in love with each other, am I giving my self false hope?

What did I do wrong?

If I choose to fight for her how do I win her back?

I told her that right now I would focus on school and getting a better job and that I wasn't interested in looking for someone else by which I was trying to say that I would be there if she regretted her decision, despite her leaving me for another guy. I told her I understood how she felt that ""what if I was with that person instead"". "

I'm a freshman right now and a Mathematics major with a 4.0 GPA (although that's kind of irrelevant since I'm still a freshman, I suppose). I took Calc 1 last semester and I am taking Calc 2 this semester. I will be taking Calc 3 next semester.

I was originally planning on studying for P/1 during the summer so I can (hopefully) pass it as soon as or during the first couple of months that school starts again. I was planning on reviewing/going over the basic concepts and work through problems for Calc 3 and just learn what I needed to know for the P/1 exam and then just learn the rest when the new semester starts.

My other option would be to take an online course for Calc 3 at my college and then study for P/1 soon after.

The main problem is that I will be working full time during the summer so Option #1 seems more practical to me. Also the sooner I pass P/1 the sooner I can start applying for internships. Though I don't think I'll be able to get one as a Sophomore applying with only one exam and (hopefully) a 4.0 GPA, I can at least try and the earlier the better.

I'm in my 2L year and have been putting myself through law school with loans. Last summer I couldn't afford to take an unpaid internship so I took 8 credits worth of classes instead (and lived off loan money). At the end of this year I will only need to take 23 more credits, and will be in the same position of not being able to afford an unpaid internship and will definitely be taking more summer classes.  If I take 10 summer credits, I'll only have 13 credits left, so only one semester. 

About an hour ago I met with some academic services lady about accelerated graduation, at which time I turned in an application for it. She sort of told me, not in so many words, that there ""usually has to be some sort of extenuating circumstance for them to allow someone to graduate early"" and although she understands my financial dilemma of not wanting to pay for an entire semester of credits that *I don't need*, it might not be enough to warrant an approval. 

I think this is completely fucked up, and I honestly don't see how the school can force me to spend an extra 25k when all my graduation requirements have been fulfilled. Am I way off base here? Does anyone know what I can do if my application gets denied? Is there even a next step, or am I out of luck??"

However, I did right at/above median on first semester exams. Despite teaching friends a ton of concepts in study groups, they universally did better than me.

I'm meeting with a professor I'm close with for some guidance, but I figured I'd ask here too.  I have a suspicion it comes from me writing treatises instead of concise IRAC point-getting aggressive exams.

T1, good background, confident in classes and theory, write exams like PhD Theses, not IRAC Law School exams, got median grades."

I am certainly not in tech support, nor am I a tech savant, but I usually do okay fixing minor issues by myself (Google is a helpful friend indeed).

But this is a story about how I was a moron.

I was something like 16 at the time and had an internship at a very small law firm. I was given simple tasks mostly but was happy to be there.

I was told to fax some important documents to the local court, and feeling that fax machines feel horribly outdated I had never really used one before.

The process was therefore explained to me by the firms secretary and I figured it would be simple enough.

NOPE. It refused to send, (error message was something like ""line busy"") I tried a few times and the friendly secretary told me that it happens sometimes when the court gets a lot of traffic and that I should try again later. 
Try several times during the day. Nothing, always the same error. I take a look at the fax-machine settings, I can find nothing wrong. I Google it, no reasonable explanation that I can find.

I am horrified, did I manage to screw up their fax-machine? Is this my fault?

I go and speak to the secretary, trying not to show my fear that I, the intern (and on my first day no less) screwed up their fax-machine.

We check it out together when I realize. I have been trying to fax it to the firms own number, not the courts (which was on the paper on a different spot) *internal face-palm*.

""This is the correct number right?"" I ask innocently pointing at the new number I just discovered.
""That's right.""

Fax goes away no problem.

*Phew* never tells her why it didn't work...

17mhi9,17,2013-01-31,Day 4: What are your top 5 reasons for quitting? Here are mine. A method that is really helping me. ,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/17mhi9/day_4_what_are_your_top_5_reasons_for_quitting/,"One of my methods to keep myself away from weed is to write down 5 reasons to why I am quitting or why I should stay away from weed before I go to sleep. As soon as I wake up, I read them and try to visualize what quitting will mean for me in the long run. After 4 failed attempts so far I've had a lot of succes with this method. Because whenever the thought of smoking comes up all these reasons go through my head and it feels like i'd be sabotaging myself if i'd toke again. 

---------------

1. **Dreams and Goals**: I won't be able to put myself towards them for a 100% if I am high all day everyday. I do not want to look back at myself in 5 years and regret what I did with them. 




2. **Motivation**: Without weed I am motivated by life and my dreams and I am able to go out and do something without putting much thought to it. Youtube videos, videogames and other stoner activities no longer motivate me to stay inside all day long and do nothing at all.

3. **Health**: I am Asthmatic, and since I quit (even with a vape) it feels like my lung capacity has gone up by a 100%. My anxiety also has gone away. Not 100% yet, but I am improving by a lot. 

4. **Diet and workout**: When I wake up and I have nothing to do, I seriously feel like going for a run. Theres no wake and bake anymore, I feel like I have to be active and being lazy is not an option because I have so much energy. As for the diet. I don't feel like I should be eating at every hour of the day. Its also nutrition over sweet's because I dont have munchies. 

5. **Taking Life Seriously**: I'm 25, and in retrospect; whenever I went back to my old smoking habits, it feels like I am going back to being 17 again. I did not care much about my future, and life day by day. All my responsibilities go out of the window and I really become a slob. Quitting makes me feel like an responsible adult for the first time.


----------------------------

Right now I am on day 4. Mentally I feel like this could very much be day 14. I still have these headaches from time to time and feeling like I am living in some sort of fog. But there are no cravings. My apetite isn't suffering and I also get enough sleep. The most important thing I noticed is that I am happy, much happier than I am when I am high, which might sound odd.

Previously I managed to quit for an entire month before 4/20 last year, but then started spending about 10 Euro a day and kept that up til 4 days ago. In 4 days from now my internship at one of the most respected companies in the industry starts, it was my main reason for quitting because thats the very start of a lifelong goal and a career. But now I am realizing again that quitting will help me much further than that. "
17mfqb,54,2013-01-31,Amney -- a Ouija board experience ,beforethewind,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17mfqb/amney_a_ouija_board_experience/,"My uncle started hospice last weekend. 

He is not terribly old. Of course, he is not terribly young, either. He is my grandmother’s brother, on my mother’s side of the family and he is dying. I am sitting on his bedside and outside, far away, police sirens are roaring. He was always our uncle, but he was more of a cousin, he was more of a peer. Uncle was a child at heart. With my brother and I being the only children in the family, he was our de facto cousin. He was the family friend we could relate to. He was not a condescending source of maturity; he was as ridiculous and optimistic as we were. The fact that he is dying destroys us. It destroys me. An obnoxious measure of sirens blots out my thoughts. 

Adam is taking it with particular difficulty. He is the truest baby of the family and my younger (and only) brother. That is not to say that the rest of the family is coping any easier. Uncle Jack was the youngest of his siblings, as well. It is a terrible situation no matter how you word it. He would always be the one telling me, “John, you take care of Adam if anything ever happens to us,” meaning, the older relatives and my parents. That advice gives me little solace today. 

Uncle Jack was a police officer for many years. He married a beautiful woman who we came to love as our aunt in his early thirties and that was probably the symbolic ending of our “peer relationship” with him. At that point, he was our elder. We were no longer arbitrary cousins. It ironed out the family. We knew who we were and what our family consisted of, at last. Adam was almost out of middle school when this happened and I was just graduating high school. 

It is incredible what a decade can do to your being. Adam is now a police officer, very much so following in the footsteps of his beloved uncle. But Uncle Jack, dearest uncle… he is not nearly as thriving. He maintained a lustrous career in the New York Police Department and was looking forward to retiring by fifty. Instead, he contracted a rare cancer, probably due to a consistent bout of responding to emergency calls in this one devastated area of the city. You know the area: uprooted partitions of asbestos and every god damned carcinogen known to man were crudely molded into low-income housing. Now, every time some schmuck with a gun let a slug fly, these chemicals became airborne. These chemicals infected the lungs of the men and women who were there to protect the innocent bastards who were unfortunate enough to live in these areas, to live besides the walking scum of mankind that fought such petty wars. And now he was dying, before sixty years of age. 

I will not get into the philosophy and utter bullshit that comes into play when discussing such matters. Would a just god allow a kind and fair person to die before the age of seventy? Would an omnipotent universe allow a schoolyard of young child to be slain at the end of a gun belonging to a madman? I am not one to even begin rationalizing these conversations and will sure as hell not begin to do so here. The fact remained: my uncle was dying and my family was preparing for the absolute worst. And we struggled against futile efforts. 

Adam and I, we grew up and matured under almost direct-influence from my uncle. Of course my dearest mother and father crafted our personalities. Of course our friends and schoolmates helped to form our ideas. But, as far as anything beyond our genetic destinations, our uncle was probably singlehandedly responsible for our identifications as selves. From our profound interest in the afterlife to our preference to spending the weekends playing paintball in the mountains, he forged us. Honing in on the whole “afterlife” aspect of our interests, he gifted us one item that truly solidified our love for the macabre. When I was just beginning high school, however many years ago, our dearest uncle gave my brother and I a simple Ouija board. 

It was a mass-produced and super commercialized item. We were, concurrently, super skeptical, but my brother was feebly open-minded and I was always looking for a way to spook myself and my family out. The silly board game even had a “glow in the dark” feature that added to the ridiculous nature of the whole ordeal. This led to Adam and I spending countless afternoons in the basement, sitting cross-legged on the floor in the dark, peering into the softly glowing, barely visible face of the Ouija board. 

My skepticism had never left me and Adam was never particularly deft in the craft of manufacturing a storyline and characters of a fictional persona. So, when we began “meeting” otherworldly beings and dead humans through this board game, I was a little bit more than pleased and worried with our findings. Whenever we would ask their names, we would get a handful of random letters that only loosely resembled realistic names. But their backstories would always be spelt with the utmost of tact and grammar. While their names were gibberish, their explanations were perfect. It was a tad unsettling, sitting as the elder in the room. 	

With all of this apparent fright, let it be known that I was never upset with my younger brother. I did not receive these paranormal readings as malcontent on his part. It just surprised me, at times in pride, at others in fear, that he could move the dial on the Ouija board and spell out entire life stories of people who had lived in the 14th, 18th, and 19th century. How did he, a public student living in 21st century America, know the politics of Luxemburg? How did he know that women in historical China would bind their feet? How would he, a boy who had barely begun to pick up the guitar, know what a mandolin was? I could not tell if it was my practical joking getting the best of him and I concurrently or if otherworldly forces were at play. Could this ridiculous board game actually channel… something else? Of course not. I refused to believe it. It must have been something about our subconscious or some other psychological phenomena that I could not explain.

Time went on and I found other vices to occupy my time. I found petty flirtations with girls my age that never came to fruition. Young puppy love and relations that never manifested themselves into an actual relationship. I was far too afraid to actually ask a girl out on a date, so these feelings only resulted in my confiding with my good friends. But I had not kept tabs on my younger brother. As where I had grown tired of playing with the Ouija board, Adam kept at it with his friends and even, at times, by himself. In the days that we had played with the device, we had “met” an entity known as Xenon. It was a completely ridiculous and unbelievable name, but she was supposedly an Asian immigrant of the Luxemburg storyline that I had previously alluded to. She was a servant of a household in the European micro-nation. She had also played the sitar. How my brother had created these characters, I have no idea. My imagination was certainly not at play and I, even as a younger teenager, truly did not try to disenfranchise the results of the board by creating my own metaphysical stories to frighten my brother. 

I allowed them to play with the board without supervision for quite some time. He had shown it to various girls and boys from the neighborhood whenever I was working at the local craft store. As I had said, I was no longer interested in the game, but his young mind surely was. Life went on. 

As we grew up a bit, we would cater to our love for the paranormal through alternative means. Fortunately for us, it became a topic of popular culture and many television series and specials were produced for broadcast programming. This allowed for our parents to become involved in our hobby. After a few episodes of a ghost hunting show on television, my mom confessed, with a slight bit of sarcasm and enthusiasm, that she had thought she had seen a “woman standing in our living room, late at night.” This was, of course, an appeal to my brother and I, an attempt at stirring our imagination. I nodded and worked on my dinner as Adam stared in amazement and swore that he, too, had seen such a manifestation. Our dog, a small Jack Russell Terrier, entirely white except for a splotch of brown on her head, took this opportunity to steal some food off of his plate. The little rat had always sat right behind Adam, sharing his chair and hoping that he dropped food. 

Having been next in line for our creative development (behind my beloved uncle), my mother would consistently drop little story starters into our daily lives and never provide much more to go on. Much like the short story about the woman in the living room, she would give us a mental image and an out-of-the-ordinary situation, and let the ideas cultivate in our young minds. This continued for a long time and at certain points, I could not tell if she was merely being whimsical or actually telling stories which had occurred in her life. I remember when I was a freshman in college, visiting home for the winter, she swore that when she was working on her computer in the kitchen, our dog walked past her legs and into her bed which was typically at my mother’s feet. She reached down to pet my dog and realized nothing was there. A few moments later, after searching, she found the dog sleeping upstairs. 

Weeks later, after watching one of these television series with the entire family, we found ourselves enjoying a scene, invariably scripted beyond oblivion, of the “paranormal investigators” utilizing a Ouija board and attempting to talk to spirits in the attic of an old house in Washington State. Adam sat there on the couch, with this knees held against his chest in rapt attention. It was pleasant to see that childhood enthusiasm alive and well. Although he had still regularly played with the board, seeing this television show had completely rekindled his love of the game. He asked that I would play with him that weekend when he had his friends over. 

There were two boys and a girl. They were all around fourteen years old and, naturally, little shits. There is really no other way to put it. I am all but positive that one of them and the girl were a couple. He’d take every opportunity of physical contact as a grace-lacking attempt at touching a personal area of the girl’s body. Were this incident to occur today, modernly, there would absolutely be harassment issues brought up between the girl and the boy, their school’s guidance counselor, and possibly the police. But that is merely my age revealing itself. Unfortunately, the curse of young adulthood and piss-poor personalities did not keep its hands off of my younger brother. 

Before we began the séance, we sat around the board and Adam gave the instructions, their objectives, and his “house rules” of sorts. The girl lit three candles and turned the lights off at his request. He warned his friends to be very serious in this exercise. He warned that it could be a lot of fun, but that they may end up talking to very powerful and sometimes malicious entities. He did not want them to display any disrespect or rudeness, because he frequently had spoken with “demons” who had initially introduced themselves as benevolent spirits. One of the boys asked what he meant and Adam, appealing to the annoying nature I had previously mentioned, told him that he would be temporarily cursed. Further inquiring to what Adam meant, he told him that “whenever he went into the bathroom, your face would be replaced with white eyes and a horrible screaming mouth” – I intervened and told him to knock it off. There was no point in playing with this if you were going to be a lying schmuck throughout the ordeal. 

He laughed at my objectivity and apologized. The three others laughed nervously too: they still believed in my brother’s ridiculous warning. No such “curse” ever came about, so there’s always that. Ha.
Before long, we encountered an entity that refused to give a name. The boys teased, saying that it was afraid of us, and the board said, simply, “bullshit.” They asked if it was a boy or a girl and it did not respond, again. The group was quiet for a little bit, nervous, and the girl hazarded, “Are you a demon?” The room was still for a moment, then the dial moved, all of our hands on it: yes, you little slut. I chalked it up to the touchy-feely boy, but he looked as shocked as everyone else. They were a little upset. 

Adam looked genuinely worried at this point. He apologized to the board, for our rudeness and whatnot. It responded with a simple “fine” and the group did not really know where to go from there. One of the boys finally asked, adding an additional apology, if they could speak to someone else and the demon could be on its way. The board told us that he would not release the board to any other entity. We were going to speak to him and him only.

This seemed to really not sit well with anyone. I, well, I was interested. I held my smirk behind a straight-grit in order to keep the group still and petrified. Without asking another question, the dial moved once more and scribed a sentence that chills me to this day: tell that brother of yours to stop being a smartass. My eyes widened and I looked at Adam. Adam looked at me and then wore an expression of a man twenty years his elder, so far removed from the comforts of modern living. He wore the face of a parent burying his child, of a surgeon failing, of a war veteran outliving his comrades. He bore too much knowledge about the situation at hand, far more knowledge than anyone in the room. Essentially, this was not a joke. We had all removed our hands with this last insult and Adam motioned to return them, clearing his throat.
“Demon,” Adam asked. “Is that you, Amney?”

The familiarity and tone in my brother’s voice made the hair on my neck stand. Without a second to contemplate the situation at hand, the dial read “yes.”
“Listen, we were just interested in showing our friends how the board works. We mean no harm.”
“I know, you little fuck. I was just checking in. How’s the family?” The board wrote.
After the response, the dial rapidly shot to each corner of the board, to the decorative pictures that branded the extremities. Nonsense.
“We’re… we’re fine, Amney. I know we haven’t spoken in a while.”
“Good. Good.  Which parent do you love more?”
At this point, I picked up the little dial and clutched it tight, standing.
“No, we’re done. This is bullshit. Adam, I don’t know if you’re fucking with your friends, or… or what. But we’re done.”

The fucking thing tore from my grip and landed upright on the board. The candles went out immediately after and the girl screamed. I moved towards the stairs and turned on the light. The candles were tipped over and the wet wax smothered the board. Most of it was covered, except for the smiling sun in the upper left-hand corner.  The wax encompassed it and most of the mess was already drying. Adam looked up at me and told me he was sorry, a single tear running down his face. He sniffed, looked away, composed himself and rapidly stood, cleaning the mess. His friends never saw his tear.

We quickly packed up and that was that. We did not talk much about it. He was obviously bothered, but got over it by midweek. We played plenty of shooter video games and we even drank a little bit of our parent’s alcohol when they went away the next weekend. That Sunday night we watched a horror movie which focused around a demon. Upon realizing the story’s premise and hearing the word “demon,” I silently hated myself and prayed that it would not bring some shell-shocked flashback to my brother’s being. No such break down occurred; in fact, he calmly and happily brought up the experience after the movie. He simply asked, “Do you remember that whole ‘Amney’ bit?”

Of course, I said yes.

“Yeah, that fucker is creepy,” he smirked.
“You talked to him a lot?” I asked him.
“Yeah. I don’t really know how to explain it. Maybe those things are like… creative unlockers? You know? Like they tap into your creative invulnerabilities and just pour words from you.”
“I don’t know, man.”
“Well, I hope so, at least. He described himself to me one time. Real creepy stuff.”
“Like what?”
“Well, he was a demon. First of all,” he chuckled at this. He was nervous at first, then the seriousness caught his voice. “He was a demon, and he told me that the  most relatable thing he could call himself, the thing I would most understand, was the shape of a dog. Except instead of your typical ‘dog-shaped’ head, he said it resembled a mask. Like a large, porcelain, V-shaped mask. Mostly blank, besides large black eyes.”

I think of my mother sitting at a computer desk in the kitchen, thinking she saw a Jack Russell Terrier move past her feet.

“Weird, man,” I reply, offering nothing else.
“Yeah…” he cleared his throat. “What did you think about when he asked about mom and dad?”
“I,” I thought for a moment. “I didn’t.”
“Good,” Adam nodded. “He would have done something vengeful.”

I did not know what he meant, but I did not want to pry. I was happy enough that we covered this topic without a breakdown of tears. We proceeded to watch some mindless programming for a few hours and he went to bed, happy.

Later that night, or rather, early that morning, I received a call from the police department informing me that my parents had died in a car accident on I-95. I did not tell Adam until later that day. He went to school, like any other day, and spent six or seven hours in ignorance. He went to his part time job at the grocery store and worked, happily and stupidly, like any other day. I had to tell him when he got home. Our uncle and grandparents were there. It was inevitable. It was not my choice. He had to know. Were it up to me, I would have kept him, to this day, ignorant of the fact that our parents died, one with the melted and molten iron and steel that cocooned their bodies. Their carcasses were inseparable from the frame of the vehicle that carried us to however many family vacations. The vessel that brought us to Disney World was now their tomb; the vehicle that brought us to the beach was now the same chemical composite as our parents. Were it up to me, I would have prolonged his revelation with bullshit in the vein of, “oh, they are traveling in Europe,” or, “they continued their weekend trip and their flights are delayed!” Bullshit. Ignorant bullshit that keeps the emotional mind at bay.

We mourned. The community supported us. I was on the verge of suicide for months. The thought of my brother being alone kept me going. Our uncle was our guardian for a while, although officially, per the government’s papers, our grandparents were our guarantors. I grew older, completed college, and watched my brother finish high school. The years that followed were uneventful. Adam got a community service commendation; I managed to break from alcoholism. I got a job in mid-management at the state health department; Adam earned an internship at the police department. We were the most typical fucked up brothers you could fine. That was until our uncle became sick.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking: oh, a family member was diagnosed with something malignant, aren’t you a special snowflake. Well, you can go fuck yourself. Uncle Jack is in hospice as we speak. I already told you this. Uncle Jack is in hospice and the sirens have been blaring all day. From all around our sleepy town in the middle of nowhere, crisscrossed by highways and interstates and roads that lead everywhere but here, the sirens have been blaring. Fire trucks and police officers from towns that never knew our name are here, portioning off an exit on the highroad.

Uncle Jack takes my hand. He looks me in the eye. The morphine is already terribly strong and it is getting stronger by the day. At this point, it is not to relieve his pain. It is simply a race against nature to cease his organ’s function. It is no longer palliative, but a challenge to god. Earlier this morning, he talked about cats I don’t own and family members that never existed, such as a sister who was “bringing him water” all day. His delusions were terrifying and pathetic. I could no longer bear to see such a loved person dealing with so much bodily failure and ultimately, pain.

Staring me in the face, he said, “Son, I appreciate everything you’ve done… but please, get your dog out of here.” At this, I was confused. I knew it was another symptom of the morphine, but I wanted to help him, however I could.

“Uncle Jack, we don’t have a dog. You know that,” I held back tears.
“Stop. Just close the door. Stop him from staring at me. Stupid… fucking… dog,” he choked.

I rose and closed the door. I could tell the end was coming. But it is never easy. It is never immediate. It is always a matter of hours, days, weeks. Sometimes, months. The sirens outside grew louder. On a day like today, no solace was spared. No grieving, nothing. Your problem was just another piece of rubbish in the mosaic that society is composed of. Little did I know that the sirens were clearing and helping sort out a pile up that was on the same interstate that killed my parents. Little did I know that my brother was driving home from classes this afternoon to help me take care of Uncle Jack. Little did I know that his sedan may have been involved.

“Son,” Uncle Jack cried. “You’ve always been as good as any child of my own that I could have prayed for. Your parents loved you. I loved you. And I could never have asked for anyone better to see me out.”
I will admit to having cried at this display.
“But please, close that damned door, that fucking dog…”
I turned to see the closed door and dropped my eyes to the floor. Poor, poor drug-induced illusions.
But, of course, he continues.

“He keeps asking me, John. He keeps asking, who do I love more, ‘Adam or John?’ Get that little bastard out of here.”

I’ll have periods of time where I’m just sad, and periods of time where I’m just numb, and periods of time where I’ll ignore the outside world and all my responsibilities and I won’t get out of bed for a week. Right now I’m in one of those really low periods where I can’t make myself do anything. The semester has just begun and already I’m missing my classes, not doing the assignments, calling in sick at my internship. All because I can’t make myself just get out of bed and go to class, or just turn my brain on and do my work. 

The past couple weeks, I can’t stop thinking about suicide. I used to think about it on occasion, but now I think about it for hours and hours every day, all through the day. I think about the different ways I could do it. I fantasize about getting hit by a bus, or having some stray bullet fly through my window straight into my head, or some other freak accident that'll do the job for me. It isn’t that I desire death itself, I just am tired of living. I don’t enjoy life. I don’t enjoy anything about living. Living hurts and I am not getting any happiness from it. The only reason I am still here is because I think about my family, and I don’t want to hurt them. Really though, they don’t need me. If I died, it would hurt them initially, but they’d heal with time. I’m a minor part in their lives. My dad has a wife and a young child. My mother just recently got remarried as well. My brother is married now and is in the stages of creating this whole new life with his new wife and new job and new home. They all have their own immediate families that I’m not a part of. 
 
The thing that really makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit is that fact that I SHOULD be happy. I have no right to hate life as much as I do. If I had the motivation to, I could excel in school and start up a successful career and have a good life. I don’t have any friends, but I do have a boyfriend that loves me. I have enough money for comfortable food and rent. I don’t have any huge life obstacles, any terminal illness, any major life traumas. I feel like a spoiled brat little shit because objectively, I have a good life. I have a good life, but I don’t care, because I don’t want it. I should be happy with life, but I’m not, and I can’t even pinpoint why. I feel so empty and hollow. All I want to do is find a nice dark hole where no one can find me and curl up and sleep for the rest of my life. 

I can’t keep living the way I’m living. I’m going to fail college and be unemployed and be wasting away in some gutter somewhere, because I won’t have the motivation to get myself out. I’ll just end up even more miserable than I already am. 

Living and feeling the way I am, it’s like I’m dying slowly. I don’t want to die slowly, I want to be at peace and not have to deal with the burden of living.

I'm a french guy currently in a CS cursus looking for an internship for this summer 2013.

I love programming in Python, and enjoy making great stuff with Django or plain Python. I'm not limited to Python as I love working with NodeJS and making beautiful web applications using Backbone. I'm also fluent in PHP and front-end work (HTML, CSS, JS).

I'm also in love with Sweden, and after several trips there, I'd like to settle for a Summer, but I would also appreciate an internship in France !"
17mbku,10,2013-01-31,Should I withdrawal from school?,[deleted],asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/17mbku/should_i_withdrawal_from_school/,"I've been on hormones for a week shy of 4 months now. I'm at this really weird stage in my transition. I'm not comfortable presenting as a guy anymore, but I also have a hefty beard shadow (2 laser sessions have helped though!), and an Adam's apple that could split concrete, and I'm not comfortable projecting my voice yet. These things are strong enough to make me not pass. However, I can't help but dress androgynous, and my long hair just looks too different to be male hair... I'm basically in transition limbo, and I get a lot of looks wherever I go and it's too much. I thought I could do it but it's just too much. Not to mention the name stuff in class triggers people to look at me because I'm being called a male name and I don't quite match up. This is my graduating semester too...

I feel like 6-7 months is enough time for me to work through these things. I think that's long enough for laser to take care of most of the hair, and I can work and save up enough for the tracheal shave. Finally, that's enough time to get my name legally changed so I can get that for my school id and diploma.

So, I withdrawal from school, and I'll most likely be readmitted because I have decent grades and a good reason. The pros of this are that I'll go back to school with my name changed, and presumably passing at least to where I won't die from glare induced social anxiety. Some cons are that I'll have used a decent amount of money on books, and I'll have to work or intern which may just fill me with similar anxieties.

This feels so petty compared to a lot of the things people here have to deal with, but I really don't know what to do..."

The working conditions are terrible. I am starting to have eye problems and headaches because of the dust and pollution.

The only incentive is the absence of punishment. My peers are dumb as fuck, and try to bully me. 

I live in pathetic apartment. We don't have a stove, or an oven, and my roommate is unhygenic. 

By all means I deserve better.

17m9c4,0,2013-01-31,I [f24] need to know what's going on with my bf [24]. ~5yrs together.,throwaway11119944,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17m9c4/i_f24_need_to_know_whats_going_on_with_my_bf_24/,"Been together 5 years or so but had an atypical relationship. I pursued him and he kinda just went along with it at first. He used my emotions for him to get what he wanted, and emotionally abused me. Looking back he had complete disregard for my feelings. He's since sorry and regrets what he's done, or so he says. He says he's a different person now. In some ways he is. Let me explain.



The abuse part was 3-2.5 years ago. I confronted about all the wrongs he's done. I found it difficult to get over, but the year passed anger towards myself for staying and him for what he did began to fade. In some instances, I tried to even overcompensate and try really hard at making our relationship work, but I was still a wreck most days. When the school year ended we decided to test run living together. I was studying for a professional test, and he said he would do it with me, and that I should take the time to study away from my parents in our college town. A week in, and he changes his mind about doing the test. I don't think he had any intention of doing it, and jsut wanted to get away from his parents. The only reason I moved was because I thought we'd be studying together and motivating each other. Instead, he did nothing. Didn't even look for a job (his parents covered his portion of rent). It made me want to study less than had I stayed wiht my parents. What pissed me off even more was that I had given up an awesome summer job that paid great in my hometown to pay rent in my stupid college town, where I was stuck with him since we split rent. I felt awful about myself, the fact that I was wasting money taking classes for this test and not being able to concentrate. He never helped to cook, was on the computer when I was asleep and asleep when I was up. We had about 3 or 4 hours of crossover time where I would attempt to study in a different room while he was on his computer, apparently watching youtube videos. Our sex life was nonexistent. I would work up the courage to initiate even though I knew he would just turn me down with ""I'm not in the mood right now, I'm tired"" or ""Not right now"". Once he said that I'd gained weight (true, about 15 lbs since the start of the school year), but he wasn't fit. AndI wanted to go to the gym together but he wouldn't go unless it was to the pool, which wasn't an activity that I really enjoyed, and he needed more than cardio. Physically, I didn't even feel like a woman. It no doubt impacted my ability to focus. Everyday felt like shit and I just wanted it to be over. I couldn't tell my parents what happened, though they think I was distracted by him being there. Not for the reasons they think though. I felt so low. I just felt like I was static and the days just went by.



That was 2 years ago. I've broken up temporarily and gotten back,our relationship has been turbulent since this year. I'm in school now and he's at home. I keep telling him he needs to find a job, that there's a huge gap in his resume and his employers will want to know what he did. He also has very little work experience so that won't help his chances in the future either. I send him links to jobs, internships, whatever, even helping out with the coummunity. And he says he can't find them and makes up excuses. Whenever I tell him about his situation he sounds like he understands how dire it is, but never does anything about it.
Present day: he doesn't have a credit card on him, no debit card, no cellphone, no drivers license. He never brings more than 20-30 bucks whenever he comes to see me on some weekends (I go to my hometown and he meets me there), not even on my birthday where he would know he'd be taking me to dinner. He didn't have enough to cover and I had to pay. He doesn't have any friends that I know about. He doesn't care to connect with people he knows. Our mutual guy friends are better friends with me simply because I'm contacting them and he never does. I call him, and recently he's answering the phone a lot less. He tells me he's in the bathroom or was sleeping. Most of the time when someone does pick up, it's his parents. But he calls me up if I haven't called him and if he's not able to reach me, thinks I'm up to no good and I have to reassure him I'm not. He never asks to go on Skype and when I ask him, he usually says no that he doesn't feel like it. Once he said that he doesn't want to see me online because he misses me too much and it's not the same as being there in person. Anyone else thinks this is fucking bs? I haven't seen him in 2 months and I ask him if he's going to see me ask I'll be in town for a day. He says ""what's the point it's only for a day and you have things to do and it just seems so complicated"". I'm there on business, but we haven't seen each other in while and I'm annoyed that he can't even put in the effort to see me. He'll probably be getting a ride from one of his parents and probably won't be taking the train if he's not able to get a ride, even though that option is available to him (not that expensive here).
So, does anyone have any insights into what's going on with him? He doesn't seem depressed, if anyone's thinking that. I've been depressed before and he would've talked to me about it if he was. Also, what's he doing at home? Any good ways I can find out without physically going to his house? All I keep getting is excuses or at best ""I don't know"" when I lay down the facts and ask him what's going on.

&gt;I don't know what you were taught, but I was explicitly taught about how Jews are better in various ways. I was taught stuff like how Jews have extra soul (I have a vague memory that this was what the term ""pintele yid"" applied to. Or maybe they were teaching that only jews had a Yetzer HaTov at all. I forget which of those two) that non Jews don't, and while righteous gentiles can go to heaven, the highest bits are reserved for the best Jews and them only. (I vaguely remember the rabbi saying something about how maybe that last bit was arranged by moshe for the benefit of the jewish people). There was also stuff about how Jews are more ""pure"" than non Jews, etc etc..
Further, I believe the books ""the midrash says"" (I think it was in one of those) had a story about why Jews had so many more laws to follow than non Jews. The story went something like this:
An intern was studying under a doctor. The doctor checked on one patient and then gave the nurse strict instructions as to that patient's diet, exercise schedule, etc etc.
The doctor then went to check on another patient, and after examining that patient, told the nurse ""This patient isn't to be restricted at all, give him anything he wants.""
Later, the intern turned to the doctor and asked, confused, what this was about, the intern having observed that the second patient seemed far more ill than the first patient.
The doctor replied ""The first patient may yet be saved, if one is careful. The second patient is a lost cause. So why torment them further with added pointless restrictions?""
(I forget exactly where this was in ""The midrash says"", but I'm pretty sure it was in there.)
Yes, the notion that it's a burden was there, but, well, there was plenty of ""we were chosen because we're specialer, and either way, now that we're chosen, we're specialest. We have to be the light unto the nations because we're betterer than them, so we have to show those inferior nations the way.""

More Advice Needed!,WoodChopper,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/17m4s2/a_college_students_guide_to_making_his_money_work/,"Hello r/financialindependence! I'm not sure if you remember me, but I posted here a few weeks ago about my money-saving strategies and since then I have read y'all's responses and revised my plan! I really appreciate all the original advice! If you didn't catch the original post, here is my updated version that I revised with your critiques!. Background: I am a 20 year old college student with two jobs, one that pays from my on-campus housing and meals, and the other that I am using for strictly saving the money that I earn from it. From this job, I earn about $100 bucks a week, which is pretty modest, but I really want to save up to 90% of the money that I make. All my life I have been educated by my father about personal finance, whether from being forced to listen to Clark Howard as a young kid, or him showing me how to open my own bank account and credit card. I am completely debt free. I have absolutely no debt. Not a dime. My college tuition is paid for by scholarships, and my housing and meals are paid for with my Department of Housing job as a Resident Assistant. I have no credit card debt and only primarily use it for gas, snacks, or the occasional night out. So all my debt is already paid down. I'm pretty sure I'll graduate with zero debt. I also have had a credit card for about 3.5 years and use it for all of my general expenses (snacks, restaurants, gas, and nights out). I've never missed a payment and have zero debt on it. I checked my credit score for the first time a few weeks ago and its a 724. Which, for a 20 year old, I feel is pretty solid? Now that I'm finally into some extra money, I want to make my money work for me, rather than just let it sit in a low-interest savings account. So I kind of made up a game plan of what I want to do and when I want to do it. I am just asking for advice on whether these are good ideas, or if there are other options that might help me better!

So here is my plan:

* From my current job and the money that I already have saved, I know that I will have at least $1500 saved up by May. I plan on putting all of this money into a high interest savings account (with a rate of about 1%(Ally Bank), as opposed the the .15% that I am currently making). My purpose for this is to have a good chunk of virtually no-risk liquid cash that I can use for general spending purchases and to serve as my general savings account.

* Luckily, I just found out I landed an internship this summer and I will make about $8500 over the course of 10 weeks, in addition to my other $100 dollar a week job. I want to put at least $5000 of this money into a Roth IRA, which would double as an emergency fund. Yes, taking money out of an IRA seems like a big no-no, but it is actually a very viable emergency fund option.

* And this next step is one that I feel like you guys helped me with the most on my last post. I want to spend a little bit of money on myself as a reward. I have always been an extremely frugal person, but I feel like I need a little reward for all of my hard work. I am looking into buying a used Kawasaki KLR 650, which will run me about $3000. I've never owned my own vehicle, so I'd love to use this reward as a step toward financial independence from my parents.

Okay, Reddit! That's my plan, what to y'all think. Honestly, I am open to absolutely anything. I feel like some more money could go into long term stocks, instead of some other areas that I listed, but I'd just like to here from some more experienced people! I know I'm not making that much money, and after all this work, I may not have a large return, but I just want a game plan that I can test out before I graduate! I'm still young, so I'd rather make all my mistakes now!"

Grad. statement of purpose,[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17m02v/critique_i_need_some_quick_advice_grad_statement/,"Hello all! Feeling in a rut right now. I have read this too many times. It is a Frankenstein of an essay and it does not flow. It's for admission to graduate school in audiology (hearing science) Any advice or corrections welcome!!

    I want to pursue an AuD at The University of X because I know that this program will 
    sculpt me into a skilled clinician, able to deliver superior hearing health care. I believe 
    my academic background has prepared me for this demanding graduate program.

    I completed my undergraduate degree in three years because I earned college credits in high 
    school and attended summer school. My undergraduate coursework included Hearing Science, 
    Clinical Audiology, Aural Rehabilitation, and Child Language Acquisition. I majored in Communication 
    Sciences and Disorders in order to work with individuals with hearing impairment. During my last 
    year as an undergraduate, I chose to undertake a pre-graduate school internship. The objective of 
    the internship was to allow undergraduates a chance to explore the features of graduate study. 
    I began observing clinical practice at the X Speech and Hearing Center. I attended clinical staffing 
    every week to discuss cases with graduate students. I also attended graduate courses weekly, gaining 
    a feel for the classroom atmosphere. I left the internship with real-world knowledge that I had not 
    acquired in a classroom.

    Since graduation, I have completed thirteen hours toward an AuD at an out of state graduate 
    program. I joined the Student Academy of Audiology and became active in my local chapter. I most 
    recently volunteered to conduct hearing screenings at a health fair. The most rewarding experience I had 
    in the program was working as a graduate clinician in the speech and hearing center. Even though clinic 
    came at 8 am on Mondays, I was wearing a smile and ready to work. I was genuinely excited to put 
    to use everything I had been learning. Every week I performed comprehensive audiologic evaluations 
    on patients ranging in age from 2 to 74 years. I performed otoscopy, tympanometry, speech audiometry, 
    and pure-tone audiometry. I gained experience measuring ABRs and OAEs. I also independently completed 
    an audiological evaluation for CAPD. I was responsible for writing formal case reports as well as a 
    reflective journal of my experiences. After working as a graduate clinician, I am eager to do it again.

    While working in the clinic weekly, I began to notice how difficult it is to put someone's hearing loss into 
    words. It is difficult with a background in the field to explain the results in the simplest way possible. I have
    decided to base my Capstone research project around the audiologists' role in counseling. I think how we
    present the information to the patient greatly affects their perception of their own hearing loss. We are telling
    them so much more than the fact that they have a hearing loss. How will they explain this to their friends
    and family? It's not possible to remember everything the audiologist said. When I go home and look at my 
    audiogram, what do I really see? I am interested in researching different counseling techniques and case report
    formats and how they convey the information to the patient. The patient needs to receive in writing a more
    basic description of their hearing loss, as opposed to an audiogram and a formal report. I would like to
    research implementing more user-friendly counseling and just how effective our current counseling methods
    are.

    After earning an AuD, I will focus on a career as a clinical audiologist. Since January I have been 
    assisting an audiologist in her private practice. I am learning first-hand everything that goes along with 
    running a practice and I think it is something I may be interested in someday. The audiologist primarily 
    sees elderly patients in her clinic and I enjoy working with that population. I would like to ensure that
    their quality of life and independence are not compromised. I understand how hearing impairment can 
    adversely affect quality of life. 

    I also understand that working in this field requires more than a desire to help others. A career in audiology
    demands determination and commitment. I believe I have acquired these characteristics through my 
    academic and extracurricular experiences. I feel prepared for graduate study, and I look forward to 
    completing an AuD at The University of X as an exciting, essential step in my career.

17lzpt,8,2013-01-30,Is it more of an asset or a liability to list an unfinished master's degree on a resume?,mentalina,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17lzpt/is_it_more_of_an_asset_or_a_liability_to_list_an/,"Just for some background, I have a bachelor's in psychology and 42 hours of graduate work towards a master's degree in mental health counseling, but no master's degree (I left school during my internship about two years ago due to hitting a wall in every way imaginable trying to balance full-time work with a 20-hour-per-week unpaid internship). My employment experience is in social services case management, and right now I'm working in child protective services and have been for two years. However, due to the absolutely CRUSHING burn-out I've experienced in this line of work I'm looking to move on to something different but related (or not, if the work is appealing and pays well). On my social services resume, I list my education to include my master's work, but, based on the fact that I've had four interviews and four turn-downs thus far, I'm beginning to wonder if I need to reframe this or even leave this off all together. 

So, questions to the forum:

1. Is it false advertising, so to speak, just to list my bachelors and leave my master's work off my resume?
2. Is it really helpful to list that I have graduate coursework but no degree, or is it actually a red flag to employers? If a red flag, for what reasons specifically?
3. If I should leave it on, how do I make it palatable to potential employers?"

About me:

I'm 25.  I have a BA in English.  I'm pursuing a BS in Comp Sci.  I have a part time retail position and another part time internship in public relations.  I just moved to another state last year with my ex boyfriend.  We love one another dearly, but things just aren't working out and we have decided to split up.  

My mother, upon learning of the split, asked me what my plans are.  I told her I'm going to move to a nearby town and get settled down before next semester.  She says I should just move back to her house.  This is obviously not an option, but for some reason she seems to think it is (I told her, the last time I was with her, that if we didn't go to family counseling she would lose me… we never went.  my relationship with my parents is **not** good.).  She called me a stubborn child and said for me to stop making my life more difficult.  I may not have financial stability but I sure as hell am no child.  I told her as much (in a nicer way) and a long argument commenced.  

Today, I get a text from my step-father (whom I NEVER hear from) saying that he doesn't know if my mom told me yet but I need to start paying my car insurance bill (80/month) they have enough bills of their own.  He wants to see me become an independent woman like my mom was when she was my age (mind you she had a child at 22 and settled for a life she is not happy with now) and that i need to stop relying on men.  My mom misses the froggy legged little girl I used to be yadda yadda.  These people (my parents) are obviously incapable of accepting that I am no longer 5.  I told him I will pay the bill and not to text me anymore.  This is not about the money, it's about respect.

I did not move with my ex for his SUPPORT.  in fact, he flipped out when he heard what my father said because he knows damn well that I will do whatever it takes to take care of my responsibilities.  My father, btw, moved in with my mom when he was about 20 and if it wasn't for her supporting him for a while he wouldn't have gotten on his own two feet… so I'm not sure who he thinks he is preaching to me.  My mother was the one who told me she would take care of the bill 'til I got settled (because she knew I was in the process of moving etc).  My parents are in no way financially constricted.  My dad plays tons of golf, my brother gets tons of video games, and my mom gets her hair and nails done frequently.

I moved out when I was 19.  The guy I moved with turned out to be abusive and I bounced around for a bit (in terms of living arrangements because my family had moved away and I had to finish school).  When I was 24 I moved back in with my mom to help her pay bills and take care of my brother because she and my step father were splitting up.  At 25 they're back together and I moved back out.  I paid my own college tuition, never asked them for a fucking penny, and everything I own I have achieved **on my own**.

I'm beyond angry.  I'm not sure what to do anymore.  I don't want anything to do with my parents, but my little brother still lives with them and we are **very** close.  I can't be around them, I can't be in contact with them.  I was supposed to visit them for valentines day and now I'm screwed cause I bought the ticket to see them but I sure as hell am not going to spend any time around them.

I am struggling financially, but like I said, I will do whatever it takes to keep myself afloat.  I'm intelligent and able.  Thank you for reading.

tldr - parents keep treating/viewing me like a child because I'm not making enough to support myself yet.  money != adulthood.  I have two jobs and I'm on my second degree.  They never went to college so all they know of is getting some mediocre job and grinding at it for years and years to make a decent income.  I'm at my wits end with the both of them and I'd cut them out of my life entirely if it wasn't for my little brother who still lives with them."

If you're not familiar with us, we print your images directly on glass, and create a final product that is picture, frame, and mount all-in-one. We were started by some UF students, and most of us either graduated from or dropped out of UF. 

Here's some stuff:

 * Looking for full-time positions, and want to hire ASAP
 * But we'd also consider an internship position for students with only a few hours a week to spare
 * Need people interested in being part of a company culture, not just grabbing a great paycheck.
 * Attention to detail, and a knack for problem solving 
 * No telecommuting or remote work. We're needy and we want to see your pretty (and/or handsome) face in our office every day
 * Only interested in people capable of self-managing and who excel at taking initiative and constantly looking out for opportunities to improve themselves and the company

Positions/Roles:

 * **Make things look good** - designer, creative director, beautificator; I don't care what you call yourself, but you've got an eye for design, a love of adobe software, a knack for understanding what us non-creative folks are trying to describe (and the confidence to tell us when we're wrong), insane talent, and a desire to see your designs on the web, on packaging, and in offices/homes all over the world.
 * **Python/Php/Ruby** - developer. Maybe not all three, but at least some mastery of python or ruby. Be prepared to show us some code samples and/or a github page.
 * **Web Leader** - you know what separates a good website from a bad one, and you love leading a team of people to make that happen. Some ecommerce experience preferred, but not required. Also, looking for an understanding of UI/UX principals, and familiarity with mobile.
 * **Lover of Data** - some people call this a 'growth hacker', and some other people puke when they hear that term. What matters is that you feel at home in databases, analytics, and excel spreadsheets, and you love applying data to practical applications and digestible action items.
 * **Marketing/PR** - *(internship)* - you're an excellent communicator, can't live without your daily dose of social media, and you love using technology to connect with people
 * **Customer Service** - *(internship)* - you're a natural born empath. Nothing makes you happier than brightening someone's day, and the idea of spending your days talking to people from all over the US excites you. You exude positivity, and are the best communicator you know.

Some perks:

 * Awesome startup with awesome people (mean age 25)
 * Awesome product that you get for free (featured on TechCrunch, BusinessWeek, Groupon, NBC Today Show)
 * Stock options
Awesome office (we won a KILLER office redecoration from Turnstone - [video here](http://blog.fractureme.com/post/40786093279/our-turnstone-experience-has-been-nothing-short-of))
 * Creative freedom; ownership of role
 * Wild, roaming packs of office dogs
 * Nap couch (for napping)
 * Snap couch (for delivering great comebacks)
 * Very pro-beard environment

If you're interested, email mike@fractureme.com. Tell me why you're interested, what you're doing now, and include a resume/code sample/portfolio/~~haiku about grumpy cat~~.

Now, who do you people think is in the wrong here. Cause I think it's pretty clear. And I'm not going to say who my friend is until someone answered so I don't spoil it.


The other thing I find strange is in all cases that he's been punished, he's been reported by only ONE person. In most cases, that person has also been toxic. Why is the tribunal community doing this?


**TL;DR Tribunal is being unfair with their cases, I think Riot needs to take a more personal level before sending warnings, even if its just dishing out a few dollars to interns per hour to seed through the real toxic players**"
