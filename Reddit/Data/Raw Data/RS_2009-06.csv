8u1vm,4,2009-06-19,About to start a long-distance relationship -- any tips from people with experience or just advice in general?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8u1vm/about_to_start_a_longdistance_relationship_any/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about six months now -- we just graduated from college and I'm heading up to Boston to start a PhD at MIT while she's staying in town to start law school next year. Anyway, things with her have been going really well so far, so we decided together that we want to try the long distance thing out next year. The ""plan"" right now is that we'll try and see each other once a month or so, however our schedules dictate, and we'll get to see each other more during Thanksgiving, winter break, etc etc. After that, well, we haven't spoken much about it, but I would like her to come take an internship in Boston (there are a lot of firms in the Boston/Cambridge area that are right up her alley), so we'll at least have the summers to spend. 

Beyond that, well, it's up the air. Honestly, part of me sees a lot of potential with her. We are young, yes, but I look at her sometimes and get the feeling that she is someone I want to get old with, if that makes sense. I'm not ready yet to get married, but I think I'm ready to have a pretty serious relationship that could lead to that in a few years, once we are graduated and more settled. The way I see our relationship is that it will be tough (in ways I'm sure I can't imagine yet), but I'm just really looking forward to the future with her. If shit happens, then so be it, but I want to at least give it my all so I can take some sense of satisfaction that I gave it my best. 

So, my question to you all is if any of you have any experience in the matter, and if you have any tips for a relatively young couple about this sort of thing. We're young, so I'm sure we don't know exactly what we're getting ourselves into quite yet, but maybe someone here can give a better idea of what it could be like. Anyway, if anyone has any comments to help a young guy that's in love, that would be great.

8udcg,2,2009-06-21,Dropped out of college and I'm moving back in for a year,locksandsafes,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8udcg/dropped_out_of_college_and_im_moving_back_in_for/,"A little background: I've been studying for one year in a far away place from home, my parents wanted me to study closer to home and in a bigger city because I could get a job easier but I liked the town I'm currently in and also I thought that what I was studying here was better taught in this particular University. My dad recently lost his job and has no way he'll be hired because there aren't jobs available in my hometown, I couldn't work while studying because I have to do internship and such and it would be a pain in the ass = no money for me and no way I could live here because I missed the scholarship opportunity this year. 
So I decided to quit this and apply to another university next year nearer to home (I could also get a job there and support myself) studying something I did in the first semester here and realized I'd like to study that further and all this with a scholarship(Its easy to take the entrance exams because I already did most of the stuff in my first semesters and aced those exams).
Last time I went home we discussed a little about this and they told me to make a decision. Monday I'm getting my papers back from the faculty, I have payed rent till the end of month and my parents aren't expecting me until the 8th of July. They will probably be surprised I'm home so early when I'm supposed to be taking my exams after 1 year of living off their money and after I decided to take a 1 year break. They are reasonable people but I'm sure they'll be a little pissed. They didn't spend that much money, the first year is pretty cheap here and it goes up from the second year(its not private but that's the policy -only 20 sponsored places in contrast to 100 places where I want to go next year) Ok, so the questions:

Any tips for this particular situation? Should I go backpacking till they cool off or stay and help around the house(I can't get a job, no jobs in my hometown) ? Any smooth lines that could get me out of trouble ? Have you ever been in a similar situation ?

What should I do for a year ? Besides teaching my parents English. I have a whole free year."

What am I doing wrong?",ct999,Economics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/8veld/i_just_graduated_college_landed_a_90k_salary_job/,"I am 24 and just received my Master's.  I have dreamt of living in Boston since I was 16, and I finally made it.


I grew up in a lower-middle class family, having never eaten at a restaurant until my college years.  My whole life, I've learned to live cheaply and minimally.  I was a resident assistant for 3 years in college, which provided me with free room-and-board.  In fact, one semester, aside from the costs of required books and tuition, I spent a total of $17.  I literally had nothing in my college dorm other than my books and computer.  It was called ""the cell,"" and you could hear an echo.  By the time I graduated with my Master's, I had worked at 7 internships and sometimes had multiple work-study jobs during the school year.  I had saved 40k by the time I graduated.  I was proud of myself.  Plus, I just landed my dream research job and I'm living in the heart of Boston (Beacon Hill).  I chose to live in a 1 bedroom apartment, as I am engaged -- once we are married, she'll move in.


**The bad news: I accumulated 85k in school loans.**  I just paid 25k towards the loans, bringing them down to 60k.



My monthly expenses follow:


**monthly salary = 7500**



pre-tax deductions:

* 401k (5% of salary; my company matches up to 5%) = 375
* health insurance = 142
* dental insurance = 6
* vision insurance = 13

	
=&gt; remaining salary before taxes = 6964


**after taxes (38%) = 4317.68**


post-tax expenses:

* bus pass = 30
* car gas = 110
* electricity = 50
* car insurance = 35
* car repairs ($600/yr) = 50
* internet and tv = 32
* 3 times going out = 100
* clothes ($360/yr) = 30
* protein = 60
* household supplies (i.e., toilet paper, paper towels, cleaner, soap) = 40
* food = 450
* rent = 1600
* other (i.e., flights, tolls, driving tickets, repairing items, gadgets) = 100

**=&gt; remaining money = 1630.68**


loan payment (minimum is 900) = 1300


savings deposit	= 330.68

Notes:

* I started my new job just 1 month ago, so the food, household supplies, and 'other' are my estimates.

* food cost of 450/month may seem high, but i have a fast metabolism.  i eat 4-5 small meals a day and cook almost every single meal, including lunch for work.  i eat at a restaurant roughly 2 times a month, and fast food maybe 2 times also.

* 'other' is probably a lowerbound, as i fly often.


Any advice would be much appreciated.  It seems with the amount of loans I have, something has to give, and it's just a shame to think that I would have to sacrifice my Boston apartment.  It's an insanely great deal; it has a parking spot, washer, and dryer.

Edit: my work is 12 miles from boston.  driving takes 30-40 minutes each way.  alternatively, i could just take public transportation which takes 50-75 minutes each way."

If you're willing (and I'd be eternally grateful!) please answer as many of the following questions as you can. Feel free to copy/paste and provide answers - or provide just a general answer without specifics. The more info the better! Also, if you find you want to PM me some of the answers I'd be OK with that too.   

**ABOUT ME** (If you're interested)  


I'm in my final internship term and need to complete this assignment to receive credit for the 8 months of work that I've done. I'm in Civil, and will be returning to school in the fall to finish off my degree. I've worked for a subtrade (piling), an industrial design consultant, and currently work for a general contractor.  

**QUESTIONS**

**1)** How long have you been working as an engineer?  

**2)** What jobs have you worked at in that time?

**3)** What promotions have you received? What led you to get that promotion? (Hard work, sleeping with the boss...)  

**4)** How have your responsibilities and work duties evolved over time?  

**5)** What do you see as the most important factor contributing to success?  

That's all! If you could also provide your name and company you work for-- or at least a professional-sounding pseudonym-- that would make it easier for me to put this all into my report.

8wtg3,11,2009-06-29,"The girl of my dreams... or, so I thought.",bazki,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8wtg3/the_girl_of_my_dreams_or_so_i_thought/,"i'm contemplating breaking up with my fiance, elizabeth.  i'm 25. the first few paragraphs describe my story with the fiance, then the problem, along with my sadness and [sexual] frustration.

we knew each other 10 yrs ago in high school. she was my first real crush.  i thought she was so unique and bold, and just so damn special.  we got to know each other back then and we became close.  nothing romantic, only platonic.  but i was okay with that.  i respected her.  we went our separate ways for college, out-of-state and out-of-country. after high school ended, my crush ended.  i dated in college.  maybe every 1-2 i'd recall elizabeth and smile, thinking 'ah yea, she was cool.  i wonder what she's up to.'  we randomly met up 2 yrs ago, and our intended 30 minute catch-up lunch lasted 16 hrs, ending at 4am.  in fact, i had to catch a flight back out to california (grad school) in just a few hours.  but, that night, she fell hard for me.  i was trying not to fall for her, but did.  i cannot explain to you how good it felt to kiss her.

she then went to indonesia and i did grad school in california. i buy plane tickets for us to meet up every 3 months. we talk on phone 1 hr daily. after 1 yr, i fly to indonesia and propose on the beach of bali at sunset. it was all good... it's been amazing. but, our religious differences are really starting to take a toll on the relationship. it's sad that this is the case, i know.

her 1 yr work visa in indonesia just expired, and she just returned to the states this week. she moved in with her grandmother, 1,000 miles from me. so we are still long distance until we get married. :-(

there are basically 2 draining factors on our relationship: (1) she has no care at all towards anything professional, and i'm at the opposite end of the spectrum. i've very goal oriented and finally landed my dream research job in boston, after 7 yrs of working my butt off in universities. (2) our religious differences mean a lot to her, and little to me.

so, i'm in this position where my life is set. i am the city i want to be, with the job i want, and with the girl i want. but, her life is completely contingent on mine; having just moved back to the states, she's in this temporary position of being in a state just for a few months until we get married, at which point she'll move up to boston with me. until then, she'll at best get some temp job and will have a boring life there. i tried arguing my case for her to move to boston, even though co-habitation is out of the picture. but she can't support herself. sadly, i can't afford to pay her hypothetical-boston rent either, as i'm already paying $1,600/month rent.

she's visiting in 2 days.

i've dated girls and have had a handful of experiences. so, i'm not quite hanging on out of desperation or attention or anything like that. i really believe we go together and mesh very well. it's just these underlying huge issues of what we believe in and are passionate about that are the issues. our interactions, sense of humor, outlook on life, overall demeanor, and way of carrying ourselves are all very well matched.

oh, it should be noted that prior to this relationship, i was dating a 27 yr old professor. we met during an internship and did the long distance for 1.5 yrs. she didn't believe in sex-before-marriage. she was agnostic, surprisingly.

i've been in a relationship with my fiance for 1.5 yrs now. so, no sex for the last 3 years. with this said, i feel as if boston is a headquarters for young, thriving adults, and maybe i could find someone who could better suit me. i admit, i sometimes daydream about going out friday nights to a local bar, picking up a girl, and going back with her to my apartment which is within walking distance to everything.

what do you guys think of all of this?

EDIT: i had no idea this many people would read my long story and care to respond.  thanks for all the advice, criticism, and support.  this was my first post on reddit, and man you guys are awesome.  well, i'm picking her up from the airport in a few hours, so i won't be checking this thread during her week-long visit, haha.  if anyone cares to hear how it goes, i'll give details in a week by writing them below this very text.  thanks!"
8x0ki,41,2009-06-30,Trading: my frugal tips for your advice?,kellogg,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/8x0ki/trading_my_frugal_tips_for_your_advice/,"Hey guys, so I just recently graduated college. In October, the student loans will come rolling in as my grace period ends so I'm looking for some advice on how to save more money and what I should do with these loans

I'm working a part-time job that was once full time until about October last year when the credit collapse happened, earning about $150 a week. My boyfriend is a saint and is paying the rent bills while I look for work and help him with his side business. I start an unpaid internship in the fall though so things are going to get tougher. So I'm thinking about deferring the loans, but everyone is telling me to pay if I can. The three loans amount to $15,000 and I'm estimating anywhere from $180-$200 to be the monthly payment. Any more tips on how to save money or what you would do in my situation would be much appreciated. Here are some of mine that have helped me save at least $3k over the year so far:

* Get the club or savings card to whatever grocery store you shop at. Check their website &amp; store for the weekly flyers and for print out or clip out coupons. Genuardi's is my favorite by far.

* Clearance Meat section: if your store has it, use it. Obviously check the meat itself and the expiration date. 

* Go to the grocery store the day after a big sale. Whatever is left over is usually on clearance for cheaper than the sale price.

*Canned foods are your friends. Essential canned foods are tuna, chicken &amp; beef broth, soups, beans. But with left-over chicken bones or vegetable pieces, like the woody parts from asparagus, you can make your own cheaper, healthier stock. see zck's comment.

* Food stores like Aldi and Sav-a-lot are sometimes ridiculously cheap. Take advantage of them when you can &amp; buy in bulk.

*By powdered or condensed milk instead of the real stuff for recipes. I buy soy milk when it's on sale instead of real milk for cereal &amp; drinking because I find it lasts longer.

* Buy cheaper cuts of meat &amp; use a crock pot to make them tender &amp; flavorful. 

* Re-use ziplock bags. I just wash mine &amp; turn them inside out. I re-use aluminum foil too if I can.

* Mix a little water in your laundry detergent to make it last longer. Only use hot water on towels or sheets. The color of your clothes will last longer too if you use cold water &amp; it'll save electricity.

* Mix a little water or milk if in your scrambled eggs if you have to feed more people, it'll make more to eat. This will affect the nutritional value of the eggs, though, see bluGill's comment.  

* Bake up canned chickpeas with some chilli, cumin, or what ever seasoning you want. Healthier than chips, cheaper than junk food.

* Oatmeal is the most versatile food ever. Buy lots of it. Make your own granola, granola bars, let it sit overnight in the fridge with some milk &amp; honey, use it as breading, or prepare it as normal. 

* Use cheap conditioner like V05 or Suave instead of shaving cream for legs or face.

* Dab some toothpaste &amp; leave overnight on pimples you have instead of buying acne creams.

* Use old t-shirts or towels you would normally throw away as dusting cloths or cleaning rags. Use rags or hand towels in place of paper towels any where you can.

* Baking soda is an excellent, non-toxic, &amp; cheap cleaner, so is vinegar.  

* Shower with the coldest water you can stand. It'll save on electricity/gas etc. &amp; it'll make your hair shinier &amp; close your pores off to dirt. 

* Don't eat out. Bring your lunch to work.

* Cut out soda &amp; juices. Drink water or tea or make your own iced tea.

* Walk/bike to where you can. 

* Do as much bill paying &amp; banking as you can online to cut out the cost of stamps/paper/envelopes. 

* Cut out the non-essentials like HD or cable TV. Trim your phone plan if you see you don't use all your minutes or texts.

* Monitor your mileage &amp; tires. Windows up if going above 45 mpg. Only use AC/heat when you have to.

* Turn thermostat off or put as low as you can at night during winter. Sleep with hat, socks, clothes, &amp; multiple blankets to keep warm.

* If you have the space &amp; environment, grow what you can. If you don't, look for CSA's in your area &amp; think about your time. I volunteer 5 hrs a week at a local farm &amp; get paid in produce. It really helps with keeping the food bill down. 



*edited for formatting &amp; adding info from comments. Thanks for all your help guys."
