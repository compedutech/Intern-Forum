qdn0f,7,2012-03-01,What a difference a year can make,throwawayamillion1,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/qdn0f/what_a_difference_a_year_can_make/,"I’m so thankful for my life that I don’t even know where to start. I have amazing friends, an amazing boyfriend, and parents that think the world of me. I go to a good college, and I’m practically guaranteed a job when I graduate. I might be getting an internship at a highly prestigious company this summer and I’m only a college freshman. Even if I don’t get it, the fact that I made it this far means the company sees something in me. It means there is something to be seen in me.


This is in stark contrast to where I was a few years ago, even just last year if I’m completely honest. I felt stupid. I felt worthless. I was a cutter for most of my life and was suicidal for a good portion of it. I couldn’t handle my brother’s and mother’s illnesses and I had been repeatedly sexually abused when I was in grade school. I hated myself.


I’ve come to accept that I’ll never be able to change my past experiences. I’ll never be able to get rid of the scars on my legs and hips, of which there are well over a hundred. However, I can still shape my future however I like it. I’ve never been happier in my life and I shudder to think that for a few years I wanted to kill myself. I had always heard suicide was a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but my problem certainly seemed permanent at the time. At the risk of sounding clichéd, I’d never been able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I was beginning to feel that such a light simply didn’t exist. I thought I was beyond hope, but now I don’t think I ever was. I finally love myself and love my life.

I mentioned in [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qbhaj/working_people_what_inconvenient_truths_does_your/c3wers1) that I used to be an editor at Maxim magazine, and received [a bit of interest](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qbhaj/working_people_what_inconvenient_truths_does_your/c3wmig4) about doing an AMA on that. So here I am. Some background: I started as an intern at Stuff Magazine when I was a sophomore in college. Once my internship was over, Stuff hired me as a full-time writer. A year later, I was hired as an editor at Maxim, Stuff's sister publication (at the time). That was about five years ago. Since then, I've been editor of COEDMagazine.com, associate editor at TheWeek.com, and now I'm a staff writer for a tech website (which I won't name here, so I don't sound like a self-promoting asswipe). I've traveled the world, hung out with models, drank with celebrities, and degraded women and men alike. AMA.

I am doing my graduate internship in a (public) fifth grade classroom and have a good chuck of time each week to go off of the curriculum and do things in the classroom that normally would not be done.

I am trying to start a new ""subject"" called Junkbox. Heres how I envision it working. My students could sign up each week to pull an activity from this ""junkbox"" and pretty much do whatever they would like with it for the week. I have a lot of miscellaneous materials that the kids could experiment with, such as gardening gear, old film cameras, tape recorders, old shortwave radios and car parts. 

What I would like to do is build up a good list of items and objects for my students to experiment with so that they can spend some time every week from now until the end of the school year experiencing things (ideas/technologies) that they would normally not encounter in an elementary school.

So reddit, do you have any suggestions? If you could take any sort of age appropriate object into a fifth grade room, what would it be? What would you hope for the kids to get out of it? Ill take any suggestion into consideration and if any of you have any weird old gizmos or gadgets that you would like to introduce to a fifth grader I would be more than happy to take anything off of your hands!

Oh. Its a public school. I have no budget.

EDIT - I have and hour to an hour and a half each week to devote to this.

Based on the discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfwoutfits/comments/qbm9l/nsfwoutfits_state_of_the_subreddit_lets_talk/) and a bit of research, I think the decision is going to be to ban fappytaffy and divvy.net posts.

Why for? 

First, the accounts that post content from these sources seem to almost exclusively post content from related sources. 

Divyy.net states they are 

&gt;Divyy is the pics/link branch of the AIPT Network.

AIPT in this case stands for Adventures In Poor Taste. If you look through the post history of [kellenwelker](http://www.reddit.com/user/kellenwelker) and [terraryze](http://www.reddit.com/user/terraryze) you will see they post content from sites that are part of the AIPT network. They also post occasional imgur.com links, but I think these are incidental.

I do think that both of these submitters are real people who *kind of* want to interact with this community. I also think they are paid interns submitting links to blogs.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/l1ynC.jpg) is an image detailing divvy.nets advertising spaces. 

Moving on to fappytaffy, which may or may not be related to the AIPT network (if anyone can confirm or disconfirm, that would be great).

According to fappytaffy.com, 
&gt;Images are not the property of Fappy Taffy unless otherwise stated and all copyrights belong to their respective creators.

Fappytaffy is just a rehost, only unlike imgur (which does sell ads, but they are small and non-intrusive) is completely overrun with ads.

**tldr: I believe that fappytaffy and divyy.net are blog spam and should be banned.**

I would entertain a response from either of the posters mentioned here explaining *why* they submit so many AIPT network links. Simply posting and saying ""if you don't like it down vote it"" is not good enough.

This is supposed to be a community, not a clearing house for interns to make cash from clicks on blogspam sites. We have imgur (created by a redditor for reddit) and we should use it. 

Finally: should we ban all non-imgur hosts? Or just the AIPT network?

What say you, r/nsfwoutfits?

PS: this will be the final self-post for a while, sorry for taking up your front page with business.

My friend wants to go on a 4 month ""internship"" to Africa to work for an international non-profit doing what they say will be work on local government policy. Kicker is not only will she not get paid, its going to cost in her excess of ten thousand dollars to do (paid to the organization). 

It just seems like they are using student volunteers as a cash mill. 

The selection process was almost non-existent consisting of a short online application and a 10 minute phone interview leading me to believe they just take anyone that applies. I mean, if this was for an actual internship that was going to do real work, you'd think there would be a bit more of a process to try and find the right candidate.

I want to find out if anyone on reddit has done something like this before and how it turned out. Is this really just a cash mill to raise revenues for the NPO or do students actually get an experience out of it (more so than just travelling there or doing typical volunteer work like building a well).

qd8j7,3,2012-03-01,Finishing my degree: bad idea to do an applications programming internship instead of faculty-recommended classes in systems programming and security?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qd8j7/finishing_my_degree_bad_idea_to_do_an/,"I have a year of lower-division college CS credits in object-oriented and procedural programming in Java and Python, conceptual foundations (binary representations, machine/assembly language basics, vocabulary), and another two quarters of advanced work in operating systems concepts, some really basic kernel programming, data structures in C and C++, and networking and security overview. I need one more quarter of upper-division CS work to graduate with a bachelor of science.

I was just offered a paid part-time internship at a local small business, doing applications programming in a high-level language, probably Ruby on Rails or PHP. I would be able to get the credits I need to finish my BS with this internship and just one more class (Analysis of Algorithms) and I'm really, really tempted. I'm feeling pretty damn burnt out on school lately, I've always enjoyed applications programming more than more hardware-aware work, and making money sounds obviously superior to not making money.

But I know that my faculty will strongly encourage me to stick with the default curriculum for the last quarter of a CS major, which is systems programming and security, and so I'm looking for feedback here about how much weight I should give that advice. It's the same story for both subjects -- useful and somewhat interesting stuff, I'm glad to know what I've already learned, but I just don't get excited about it. I do enjoy writing in C and C++ (notably unlike a lot of my classmates), and I found the academic exploration of networking protocol stacks fascinating, but kernel programming and network administration don't appeal to me as careers. To top it off, I feel like the professors that teach those two classes don't add much to the understanding I get from the textbooks, so if I change my mind later, I could very well get 95% of the benefit just by buying the book and teaching it to myself.

Am I making a mistake here? Is there something important I'm not considering? One side of my brain screams, ""no, you idiot, internship is obvious win"", but the other side says I don't have enough information about my future desires and what employers would prefer to see....I have decision fatigue, help me out."

qd1a1,1,2012-03-01,"My boss hasn't paid me, or any other employees, tell me the obvious, what should I do?",hitraj47,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qd1a1/my_boss_hasnt_paid_me_or_any_other_employees_tell/,"I have been working a paid internship for about 8 months now. My boss is behind in pay, he owes me 3 paychecks which is about a month and half's worth of work. I don't know how behind he is with the other employees either and we are a small business (my boss is the CEO).

On top of that, he owes the landlord for almost a year's worth of rent (about $35k, USD). As I said, we're a small business and we do web design and development. My boss is more of a marketing person and he keeps going on about this ""big contract"" that he'll get and he'll be able to pay us. He's used this excuse on me, the other employees and the landlord to constantly put off paying any of us.

Even more BS, is that yesterday he offered to make me a salaried employee, with an increase in pay... HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE NO MONEY OR INCOME? We are actually in the process of moving to a new building because I thought, it was because he couldn't afford to keep this current place. I only found out yesterday that he was being evicted for not paying his rent for a year.

On top of that, he's being used by two previous employees for past pay. I know I should have left a long time ago, but how should I go about doing it? This is my 2nd real job ever, I've wanted to do web design for a while and I really enjoy the work, but all this has made me feel really crappy about it.

I am a student, I have enough money to pay for tuition [as long as I don't go crazy with buying luxury items] and my parents are letting me stay with them for now. Should I just walk away and have nothing to do with this company/my boss (I see no future for the company and no way to save it, tbh), how would I get my pay from him? He is currently in another state taking care of family matters, but he said next week [he gets back Monday] he'd have my money. It's BS, he does this all the time, to all the employees (all 3 of us), he's trying to put us off until he can come up with the cash somehow!

I like the work that we do and I enjoy it, so I understand wanting to keep the business alive, but damn, sometimes you just have to quit while you still can. I feel like there is no way out of this hole he's got himself into and his constant lying and BS pisses me off (one thing I can't stand is people who lie). I've been doing web design for a while, but I've not had anything professional on my resume, which is why I took this job. Since a lot of what I know is self taught, I wanted to see where my skills where and I've come to find that I'm pretty good at what I do. I feel like I'm wasting my time and skills here, how should I go about leaving?"

[KATIE LEVINE](http://katielevineisawesome.com/) and [ALLI BREEN](http://facebook.com/allibreen) are here, cackling away like hens in a henhouse, and making Patrick fight for control of his own shit. Patrick gets an email from another listener who wants to move to Los Angeles and be an intern. Patrick gets a weird complaint from a fan who’s never done anything for the show, and more emails from fans roll in. Patrick talks about a new gay hotel in New York, along with our upcoming trip and shows in NYC. Collin is a fan sitting in on the show and furnishing Patrick with Jameson, which goes down swiftly. Patrick makes Jewish jokes, talks about what’s wrong with waiters and waitresses in L.A., and oh, so much more.

qcvvv,1,2012-03-01,May be moving to Owensboro this summer,Dr_Duality,Owensboro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Owensboro/comments/qcvvv/may_be_moving_to_owensboro_this_summer/,"So I'm finishing up my internships and signed my first official job offer.  I was told I would probably be sent to Owensboro, but I've only passed through the area once.  Would anyone mind giving me a run down of the city's highlights?  I would love to know what I'm getting myself into and maybe meet a couple people for my wife and I to hang out with once we get there.

We're a married couple in our mid-twenties with a son who will be one this June.  We are both avid gamers and really hope there is a nice gaming shop there so we can meet some people and get in on a DnD or Pathfinder group! We are both athiests, but tolerant of anyone's beliefs so long as they are tolerant of ours.  My wife is really hesitant about moving to Owensboro (was hoping to move closer to her family) so it would probably help her if she made a couple friends in the area before we move down there.

Thanks for reading!"

I want to get a PhD, but I am not very interested in academia (PhD is more for fun than anything else, it's not because I need something to do). 

**Question 1:**  Are there jobs in industry for a PChemist? I know some people do spectroscopy, and some companies hire a couple of computational chemists for modeling. But that's seems very limiting. So I just want to get some opinion from the experts. 


**Question 2:**  As an undergraduate, are there any summer internship? 

Thanks!

I guess I just don't want to not have a job and end up doing modeling for wall street or something. 


(I know there are a lot of internship posts recently, so I apologize for another one. But there are none about PChem specifically.)"

I'm a recent Penn grad, poli-sci major, 22, living in LA, currently being supported by my parents (I know, I know). 

After being out here a few months and not being able to find a job, I've decided to cut my losses and focus on law school again (law school was the plan since I was 4 years old, but I had a change of heart the end of senior year, long story). I enrolled in Testmasters and will be doing that until the June exam, but I've got a lot of time to kill between now and admissions season. Any advice on what I can do to fill my time in that void? Specifically law-related experiences that will make the admissions committees like me more?

I came out here to work in entertainment but I'm lacking in experience so that was kind of a dead end. I was thinking about maybe volunteering for the Obama campaign or trying to intern at an entertainment law firm. I'd prefer to be paid obviously, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

Feel free to flame me for leeching off of my parents, but just know that I loathe myself already :-P

TL;DR - I graduated last year but still don't have a job, I'm doing Testmasters for the June LSAT and need suggestions for stuff to do before next Fall."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What sort of things do you do personally? How many AP do you have on staff? What did you use to teach, if anything? How long have you been there? Any interesting disciplinary stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3w6vyb?context=5)|Personally, and broadly, I try to maintain balance between work life and personal life. I have a girlfriend who's also a pretty busy professional (not that kind of professional), which makes uninterrupted personal time all the more important. As a teacher, I used to have my personal phone check my work email; when I got into administration, I turned that off. More specifically, I live in an area with easy access to both the outdoors and the trappings of a big city; I try to enjoy both.  We have three other staff with the job title ""assistant principal."" We have other administrators, though: guidance director, vocational/tech. subschool ""principal"" (but on an AP's scale, and with lots of AP duties), activities director.  I used to teach English.  I'm new to this school; I've been here less than two years.  Many interesting disciplinary stories. Some are unfathomable given their severity, e.g. breaking a kid's orbital; others are incomprehensible given their ridiculousness, e.g. disrupting class because of something they heard third-hand about what someone posted on Twitter last week (only slight exageration with this one); others just flat-out don't make sense, e.g. handing a bag of marijuana to another student five feet from an observing security assistant.
[Given that school violence peaked in the late 1960's and has been in continuous decline since then, how do you justify increased spending on security over academics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3wdjfd?context=5)|I don't. I don't control budget allocations like that. Those are very much state and local decision. To a large extent, any kind of expenditure like that is a result of responding to constituency concerns. Not every voter or community member can place their immediate beliefs and anxieties within a broader context or historical trend. I don't know how much our security allocations/expenditures -- equipment, salaries, etc. -- compare against other expenditures, nor how they've changed over time. Sorry.
[What's the most inappropriate thing you've seen/heard of the kids doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3w7fz8?context=5)|A girl hooked up with a student. She claims to be pregnant. Questions abound.
[Do you have a goatee of sorts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3wek6j?context=5)|No.
[I went to private school, and I always heard these crazy stories from the public school kids about things like, bathroom graffiti is found insulting a teacher and the school is put into ""lockdown,"" drug dogs walking the hallways, needing to get permission to go to the bathroom, not being able  to go out to lunch.  Sounds more like a prison than a school.  Why do you guys have all these rules?  Does it make it harder to learn when students are in this kind of environment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3w84u0?context=5)|Some of these are just wild stories kids make up themselves. There aren't drug dogs, and insulting graffiti just gets cleaned up.  Yes, there are some limitations on things like going to the restroom and going to lunch. The ""rule"" for the restroom is, ""Get a pass from the teacher."" Part of it comes down to safety and security: if we see a kid walking the halls and he has a pass, we know a) the teacher knows he's out of the room and b) this kid is going to/coming fomr where he's supposed to be. If a kid's in the wildly wrong part of the building, we might be curious about why he took a long route (was he planning to skip? did he lie to the teacher? is there a test today and he's delaying it because he's nervous?). If there's no pass, we have to wonder a) does the teacher actually know the kid's not there? Is the teacher appropriately supervising the kids? b) is the kid just getting to school? skipping? doing something inappropriate elsewhere? Signing a pass also reinforces the teacher's control in the class; with the teacher as gatekeeper to leaving, the teacher can ensure the kid isn't just stepping out and missing an important part of the day's learning. And, yes, some teachers just let kids go, and that can be a bit frustration.  As for leaving campus, my county does not have any open campuses for lunch. It fundamentally comes down to student safety and security, period.  Students are afforded tremendous rights in public school, and also commensurate responsibilities. Kids have lots of options and flexibility for courses. There are dozens of sports and extracurriculars. They have publications that, in most schools in my division, do not go through prior review, i.e. kids have real exercise in expression and communication to the community. There are innumerable enrichment and remediation/support opportunities, in individual classes and academically as a whole. Counselors, school psychologist, social workers, parent liaisons, and lots of volunteers help round out of the whole-person health/wellness piece of allowing students to learn. Are there limitations? Yes. Is a public school a prison? No. (At least, not mine, nor others in the area. I realize there are caveats for learning envrionments that have even more restrictions, but even then, there are also supports and great opportunities.)  Yes, some students struggle with limitations: block scheduling, 90-minute classes, early start/release times, etc. Our system has a few alternative schools that are highly successful at working with students who don't thrive in our regular setting, and we do our best identify those students and help them make a successful transition.

[Interesting, my high school takes a different approach, where classrooms dont exist. Instead we find an area to work in that suites the suject we're working on (science lab for science stuff, math for math). So students are constantly roaming the halls here. Instead of governing by a certain set of rules, this school relies on the responsibility of the student....and by golly, the system works! Theres over 1200 students here, yet the halls arent constantly filled with chatting kids (save those going from class/seminar to class/seminar), and theres only been 2 lockdowns in the 45 year history of this school. Goes to show you that, if raised right, and if taught responsibility by example and not by a book, teens can act....grown up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3wcxf0?context=5)|Sounds like a great place to learn. My experience generally suggests that when we treat young people as if they can handle some individual responsibility, they usually do; if we treat them like trouble-making dopes, they'll act like trouble-making dopes.
[Any problems with student-teacher relations you've witnessed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3w7kfp?context=5)|Nothing of the headline-news, scandalous sort. I see kids who are disrespectful toward teachers, and that bothers me. And I see teachers who are disrespectful toward students, which bothers me more. As a teacher and administrator, I've seen several (few, but too many) colleagues who think the profession is about them, and not the kids. More often, I see mutual frustration and disrespect -- and, for both children and adults, stress, frayed nerves, being asked to do more than is humanly possible without sufficient understanding of supports in place, etc. As an administrator, I spend a lot of time working with kids on trying to improve their relationships with adults; really, though, I wish I was spending more time with teachers to help them improve those relationships -- I think there's a greater multiplier effect when I can affect teacher practice than when helping students respond to specific stressors.
[Being as you seem to be spending your day browsing the internet and answering questions from random people on the internet, don't you think its only fair that your students should have the same privileges?  Shouldn't you be working?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3w9i38?context=5)|Fair question :-). The defensive response is, I've taken today off to visit the doctor and get to the airport for a conference.  But, perhaps a more significant underlying question: I would love to see teachers comfortable enough, and students responsible enough, to better use social media and technology in the classroom. One of the most valuable life skills we can help students with is learning these kinds of behaviors. I don't think ""texting speech"" is ruining language; I think we need to help kids mode-select between writing for a mature audience and academia, and writing for a friend online. I think we need to help kids learn that, sure, they can check their email while they're sitting in class ... just make sure you alt-tab/cmd-tab back to your note-taking appplication.

Do AP's have to work in the summer ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3w8gku?context=5)|This year, factoring in my degree and time with the division, I gross  about 25% more now as an administrator than I would if I were still teaching. It's a frustrating disparity, i.e. I would prefer to see teachers make more.  I am new enough as an AP that I'm only on an 11-month scale; in a while, I'll migrate to a full 12-month scale. I technically have July off, but realistically, I'll still work through July. I might take a week or two of vacation. Similarly, I technically still have spring and winter breaks off; practically, I'll work through spring break, and I came back to work a few days early this winter.

Generally, not [group]-on-[group], though; rather, it's issues of adults (not) having an understanding of kids who look/sound different than them. The bigger facets that impact learning, though, (but also often tied into ethnicity, race, and culture) are poverty and second-language-learning.

[I am an Electrical Engineer. I don't enjoy my current meaningless, desk sitting job. My plan right now is to join the Peace Corps ( all done, waiting on them to give me a placement ), and after testing the waters teaching Secondary ( high school ) Math and Science, come back to the USA and teach High School and at the same time Coach Soccer ( I played College for 2 years ).  I was also thinking of joining Teach for America on myreturn to skip certification...Any advice?? Any reality checks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3w8nsm?context=5)|Sounds like a good plan. As a kid, some of my best teachers had ""real world"" experience beyond academic; the same is true of some of my best teachers as an administrator. Math and science experience will probably get you a lot more attention than, say, social studies teachers (us humanities majors are a dime a dozen).  Reality check #1: kids are kids, and they may not be the kinds of kids you grew up with. The perspective from a teacher is a lot different than recollections as a kid, or even perspective as a parent. Whatever track you use to get into the classroom, I hope it includes some time just observing and dipping your toes into the water.  #2: be prepared for all the non-instruction stuff that comes with teaching. Meetings, planning, collaboration, communication, professional development -- it's a lot. Across the board, we ask students, teachers, and even administrators to do more in the day than they have time for. Of those, only administrators come close to getting appropriate pay for that burden.  #3: I have mixed feelings about TFA, although none of them first-person. I've done a bit more research recently, after a former student asked me for advice on her interest in the program. It looks like TFA has some bona fides, but I do have lingering questions/reservations about how they appeal to recent/upcoming college grads and their preparation for the most struggling schools. I don't know what TFA's perspective would be on accepting someone who's been out of college for a while -- but, it can't hurt you to ask. Look at your state's DoE web site for information on alternative routes to licensure.
[How would you react in the same situation? The same way? Or blow it off? Or suspend the student journalist for refusing to name his source?

It was the newspaper reporter and editorial staff who decided to include the quote in the story, not the offending kid's -- and it should be the editors held accountable if printing the quote became hugely disruptive. Looking at this as a stand-alone incident, I think a less intrusive, less resentment-building response would be to discuss the give-and-take of being treated like/acting like real journalists. Get someone from the local paper to come in and offer their two cents.
[Why do you guys care so much if people swear? Seriously I'm 18 and got a 3 hour detention for telling my friend that she was ""one lucky motherfucker""  Is my school just dumb or do you people hold some strange code of ethics that I don't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3we4j2?context=5)|I'm curious as to context and history. Did you yell it across the room, do you have a history of disrupting class with what you say (profane or not), did you mean it sarcastically/disparagingly, had you agreed to (and, with this comment, broke) a behavior contract for language? Discipline sometimes is a response to a pattern of behavior for which there is a final, culminating incident. You can (calmly) ask your administrator to explicitly explain to you the rationale for your discipline consequence.
[Little did I realize, there was a teacher (not one of mine) walking in front of me. She turned around and was like ""WHOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"" and proceeded to walk me to her classroom and write me up. I explained this situation exactly as I am now to the Dean, and he said I still swore so I still would receive a 3 hour Friday dentition. I didn't fight it too hard because the Dean was being somewhat friendly, and detention isn't the end of the fucking world, but I still felt it was silly that an 18 year old man who has been accepted into 3 colleges and enrolled into one, is being told what words he can and can't say. Why is that anyone's business but my own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3we8ph?context=5)|I hope the school to which you matriculate is far enough away, and that you find yourself a better fit there. Sounds like the dean was applying a Uniform Discipline Policy, trying to apply a degree of consistency to stuff like this. But this, too, is an example of something I posted about elsewhere in terms of empowering teachers to address behavior they witness. I would like to think that were I teacher and I overheard that, I'd just ask the kid not to swear. Save your swearing ""points"" for when you really need to drive home a message, e.g. your exasperation about all these mf snakes on this mf plane.

Im wondering, since bad students get punished, and well, those who actually do well dont seem to get any more recognition then a pat on the back (this is true in my school, im not sure about others). Should schools reward good behavior rather then punishing those who dont do well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3w9lde?context=5)|You raise a very good question, and reinforcement for positive behavior and academic success is something we need to be better at. There are things like honor roll and most-improved for academics. You can also do things like a Functional Behavioral Analysis that leads to a Behavior Intervention Plan -- a component of which is identifying intrinsic and ""artificial""/external rewards for good behavior. (But, this is in response to poor behavior, usually.) I used to work at a school that would recognize good behavior by giving the kids a little business-card-sized slip of paper. The staff member writes the kid's name and what they did. Kid gets to show it to their parent, and then at some point drop it in a box in the main office. Every couple of weeks, there was a raffle. Pair of free tickets to home games, first name up on the electronic marquee, coupons for free ice cream. I'm not sure how well it scaled, and it did rely on teachers remembering to have the cards at hand, to give it to the kid, etc. But, it really did make a few kids' day when they were recognized for e.g. staying behind to clean up the room after a rowdy class, or turning in an assignment a few days early, stuff like that.

[As a student teacher (in NYC) I was wondering if you could give your opinion of the Common Core?  Do you think this is a beneficial development in education?  Or - as one of my profs believes - its just another way for administrators (district wide) to remove teachers' agency and independence.  Could you describe your relationship with your teaching staff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3w93my?context=5)|I'm wary of anything that doesn't treat teachers as professionals and doesn't recognize the drive and individual skills that can make them effective teachers. (For the same reason, I'm wary of administrators who don't go through the appropriate steps to dismiss or counsel out ineffective teachers who give the profession a bad name.) I don't know enough about the Common Core per se. I do know about our own state standards, and concerns about teachers having to teach to the standards rather than engaging content. I never had that problem as a teacher, because the standards, while exacting, didn't (in my discipline) determine content -- just concepts. There are some content areas where that seems less true, but I haven't yet supervised those disciplines or have enough first-hand experience to speak to how they affect teacher practice.  My relationship with the teaching staff is congenial and, in some cases, convivial. There are some teachers with whom I have great rapport and (mutual) trust, some teachers who I think are wary of me specifically and/or administrators as a whole. I try to improve and make the best of all my relationships with teachers. It's not always easy; it's occasionally very difficult.
[When I hit Middle School this all went away. Instead I was just outright suspended and given Saturday trash pick up. The principal never cared for my side of the story, and it seemed like he was trying to reach the maximum of 20 suspensions = expulsion so he could get rid of me. I've always been curious, was this due perhaps budgets and not having the resources to deal with kids during their later years? Or, does the school just stop caring at some point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3wa26y?context=5)|Sounds like you were referred to local screening and evaluated for special education services. Did anyone from the school sit down with your parents and gather a social-cultural history of your immediate family? (I suppose you might not remember.) And it sounds like you had a rough time in MS.

[I am teaching a demo lesson as part of a job interview soon for a social studies position.

What's the kid going to get out of this? Even better: add a real-world connection, too. What's the relevance to the kid beyond just meeting a state standard?  Enthusiasm for the content, or at least delivery mechanism. If you're bored and boring, your kids are bored and they're not getting anything out of it.  Connection to prior knowledge. How does this relate to or build upon what happened last class, or in the lesson that ended 20 seconds ago?  Checking for understanding/formative assessment. When you present new information, how do you know the kids get it? How do you check that you haven't lost kids? How do you respond when the class is lost? How about when it's just one kid?  Summative assessment. And this kind of hooks into the objective. How will you ascertain whether the students understand what it is you're trying to get across? Does the assessment build a bridge to the next lesson/idea? The summative might not happen during the actual lesson (esp. for something that's more complex), but students should know how they're being held accountable.  As soon as I hit ""submit,"" I'll probably think of two or three other things I'd want to see, and some of them might displace one or two of these. But, yeah, these are pretty good.
[I received in school suspension once for calling a kid I did not get along with a bitch.  I never put two and two together at the time, but how does that not fall under freedom of speech within the school system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3wa76c?context=5)|So, a few things come into play. First, the courts have identified circumstances outside of school when free speech rights can be curtailed. Quoting from my school law book, itself quoting Corpus Juris Secundum, ""...no constitutional problem arises from the prevention and punishment of certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, including defamation, incitement to a breach of the peace on imminent lawless action, threats, obscenity, pornography produced with real children, and words by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite am immediate breach of the peace."" So, free speech is not absolute. I believe schools' support for curtailing offensive speech stems from the Tinker decision, which says free speech in school can be limited when it disrupts other students' education (paraphrasing). I know there are other profanity-related Supreme Court decisions out there where the school arena may also be addressed.

They are no longer teachers.  ...but, I've also worked with more teachers who don't ""get"" kids, and who think children should accommodate teachers' preferences without offering students similar flexibility. Those teachers sometimes also struggle with recognizing that school should be learning-focused, not teaching-focused.
[I have always wondered something about Public School in general. How many teachers are there at your school? How many students? How many other staff? ie janitors, food workers, office persons and counselors (non teaching) etc. I have wondered about the makeup of staff to students for quite some time. How do you like your union? Do you get paid enough? Did you strike to get your last contract approved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3wa6sw?context=5)|We have about about 175 teachers and 275 total (custodial, IAs, AAs, cafeteria, security ... probably others I'm forgetting). Another ~20 counselors, librarians, and other folks who are on teacher-ish contracts. The district has student-teacher-staff ratios the set the framework for staffing, and the school has discretionary money that can be put toward buying additional positions. I never had any relationship with a teacher union (there are a few to choose from around here) as a teacher, and don't have any now as an administrator. I get paid enough.
[When I was in highschool, my friend and I got into a bit of trouble (it wasn't our fault) and I had to make a police statement. It was a week before semi-formal and I had confessed to my principal that my mom wouldn't let me go to semi if she found out about the statement ect. He assured me that everything would be alright, called my mom and boasted about how cooperative I was ect.. and then wrapped it all up by telling her that I should be allowed to go to semi. I know it wasn't much, but that act of kindness kept me out of trouble for the rest of my highschool years. I didn't want to disappoint said principal, and after that he often asked my advice on school programs ect. Do you try to give leeway?

[Can you address why schools are turning from education to babysitting/prison?  I am looking at the cost (emotional and aspirational) of putting people where they don't want to be, especially intelligent motivated individuals.   Is this more pronounced since you work at a minority-majority school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3w8x4f?context=5)|I think there are two parts to your question. As I replied in another thread, I don't see (or, at least, I don't agree with) the prison comparison. When I think of babysitting, I have conflicting visions of helicoptor parents and parents who just struggle as, well, parents. I don't know the *why* part, but I suspect a lot of those pressures come from outside the school, and we're struggling to respond. (I'm not entirely satisfied that I've answered your question. I think my brain is a bit fried right now.)  As for the other piece: there are a lot of things in the traditional high school model that don't work for a lot of kids. Florida a while ago (still?) expertimented with a model where kids could pick a ""major"" and opt out of certain content requirements in order to take more classes in a particularly appealing discipline, e.g. cut back on a math class in order to take another English elective because you want to be a lit. major. Dunno how that all fleshed out. More compelling is the expansion that I'm seeing (at least locally) of practical, hands-on training, internships, apprentices, etc. A nice benefit of being near a major city is that there are corporate relationships where e.g. a student at one of our nearby schools can take an auto. tech. class and graduate high school with a professional license for auto-body repair. There are similar connections with Cisco and Microsoft, cosmetology boards, dental and vetinary assistants, etc. I know Mike Rowe's testimony to Congress about skilled labor was a bit hit on reddit (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NwEFVUb-u0), and I enjoyed using this NYTimes column (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24labor-t.html) with some experienced teachers in a university course I taught.

[When male student's fight, how do you judge if it was a good fight or not? When female students fight, how many weaves on the ground constitute a good fight?

Boxers or briefs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3w9pha?context=5)|Haven't witnessed a male-male fight. No weaves involved with female fights I've dealt with.  The ""defending yourself"" piece differentiates assault and fighting. If you're hit and you don't fight back -- i.e. run/get away -- you've been assaulted, and that brings a heavier disciplinary consequence. If you make the decision to respond in find, it becomes a fight -- and, at that point, it generally doesn't matter who throws the first punch; you're both equally accountable (and fighting generally brings a lesser punishment). There is a hazy area of distinguishing between ""pushing someone away"" and whether that touching-in-response transforms an assault into a fight. This is usually the kind of dinstinction where we rely on participants' and witnesses' statements (yes, often participants are forthright about saying they hit back).  Yes.

I'm not especially cognizant of the state DOE in my day-to-day life (except around test time -- and, even then, the test results really come into play locally, e.g. how we'd deal with being known as a school that didn't meet their AMO).
[How do you deal with incompetent teachers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qb7ng/i_am_a_high_school_assistant_principal_ama/c3wadxb?context=5)|I lay out all kinds of options. If I have concerns early enough, I'll put them on evaluation, which can lead to a recommendation not to renew their contract. I can direct them toward the district's resources (mentoring, counseling). Try to find them a ""work buddy"" in the building to provide feedback. I'll be more present in their room, trying to provide more (and more actionable) feedback. Or just suggest that teaching (or teaching here) might not be the best option. (I'm adamently against ""pass the trash"" between schools.)

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Would you recommend a masters or doctorate for someone in your field? Do you have any insight into BME based startups?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8mjp?context=5)|Not really, my grad degree was worth $4k a year, not really a wise ROI. The flip side is it could lead you to a job opportunity, it could be up to you. For doctorate, it could be worth it, but your faculty adviser will pressure you to go into academia, which is very cut throat.  BME startups are where innovation is centered around. It is exciting, fast moving, and also high risk. 9 out of 10 will go bankrupt, 19 out of 20 will not make it to market, you're asked to go above and beyond the 9 to 5 engineering job. But I love it and will recommend a young engineer to try it out.
[How different is the day to day life of a biomedical engineer in comparison to say a mechanical or civil engineer? Do you Spend more of your time in an office or laboratory?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7ocr?context=5)|All depends on where the project is or what needs to be done. So early on, we will try different stuff, in lab and playing with pig hearts and making stuff on the go. Then as it matures, it becomes more paper work and relying on vendors or manufacturing techs, so then becomes more office work. I'd say there's more time in lab than mech or civil engineer.
[How much money do you make per year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8jei?context=5)|After grad school, I started at 70k, and 8 years in, I'm making 110k right now. That plus bonus and stock options.
[PhD or MS? How does the bonus system work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa4yt?context=5)|MS, bonus basically is meeting the goal that is set by my supervisor. If I meet half the goals, I get 5k.
[You have pictures of the prototypes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7xuc?context=5)|You can google the word Corevalve and see a relative example of my prototype.[corevalve](http://cdn.medgadget.com/img/corevalve.jpg)
[What's your favorite device that's currently under clinical trials?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7xuc?context=5)|That also is one of the most exciting device right now in the US. To do valve repair procedure without doing open heart surgery, faster recovery and less pain, there are draw backs though. Won't be as effective and could lead to stroke, so for now it's for an targeted patient population. There are two similar trials going on, one by Medtronic and another by Edwards.
[Was that EDMed out of Nitinol?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa21l?context=5)|I think Corevalve was stainless steel and Sapien is NiTi.
[I'm also a biomedical engineer and am on my way to getting my masters next year. I was wondering if your company is looking for any interns this summer. How challenging is it do design these prototypes? Do you use SolidWorks? Do you test biocompatibilty in-vitro?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8jee?context=5)|In general, the medical device industry is hiring, and job future looks good. The hardest part is breaking in, getting that first internship job or know someone to give you a chance, it's part of the issue with a regulated industry. I would warn about startups though, you could end up joining and company goes bankrupt in months.  Prototypes come in several flavors, (1) just a mock up (2) functional (3) pre-frozen design. I've made mock up and functional prototypes from homedepot and arts&amp;craft stuff. Some people can do it and some can't.  We use Solidworks, but not necessary in prototyping.  We test biocompatibility several ways, the most stringent is to grind it up and implant it in animals. The easiest is to put some cells on it and measure how many survived. But all the tests have to be done to satisfy regulatory requirements.
[What do you need to know to do prototyping?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa7jp?context=5)|Not much, maybe the difference between screwdriver and hammer? Some people can't prototype though, I think a good indicator is if he/she is confident (not necessarily good) about fixing a house.
[As someone who is currently an undergrad studing BME, what is the job availability for Bachelors, Masters, etc?  Also, are their any specific technologies or ideas in the industry that are quite interesting, but relatively unknown?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8kx4?context=5)|It's a regulated industry, but I would suggest you look into internship, that'll give you best chance to get a job when you leave school, to have that connection. It's a small industry and everyone know everyone, so that connection matters more than being a MechE or EE.  I think it's interesting that as more drugs are taken off the market, more medical devices are being relied on to help these patients. There are always interesting ideas worked on by people, usually in areas of cardiovascular and orthopedic where there's the most money, but they usually keep it a secret. For many good reasons.
[In my biology and neuroscience classes I always used to drift off in my mind and imagine biomechanically enhanced superhuman warriors.   Do you think in the future humans will be able to be significantly enhanced mentally and physically via neurological/biochemical/mechanical implants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8ayf?context=5)|How far in the future? In our life time? Probably only in certain areas of physical implants. The biggest issue with implants is how it is biocompatible, deal with tissue growth, and how it is maintained. So take artificial hearts, most of the implantable ones only have a short term battery, so you won't die when changing the main battery that's hanging outside your body. Things that might happen might be prosthetic that can make you run faster and jump higher, that'll probably happen soon.
[What if I told you that our lifetime will not be limited?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9r6o?context=5)|Then.... I guess yes   ...?
[I'm currently getting my undergrad in mechanical with a concentration in biomechanics and I am pretty sure I'd be looking into a Masters or a PhD afterward.  My question is, which should I go for and should I first get a job with a company that would help compensate some of the costs or should I first get the advanced degree and then look for a better job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8pdm?context=5)|I did both, where I applied for jobs and grad schools. I ended up not finding a lot of job prospects, where I wished I did more internship while I was an undergrad. So grad school made sense for me. You should probably be aware that most BME grad schools are able to support the student's tuition and stipend, in return for research (which is great for your resume). I'd say the better reason to go to grad school is the thesis work, research exp, and industry connection. I don't have any comments on the course work, wouldn't want to offend the university professors :)
[Where'd you go to school, and how is the job market for BME's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8uqf?context=5)|I would say, it's not where you go to school, but what you did with it that counts. Where I went to school did nothing for me in terms of grad school and first job out of grad school. 1/3 of people I work with came from no-name schools.   Carnegie Mellon University. I guess I shouldn't have said the phrase, it means different things for different people.
[How long before replacing one's heart with a mechanical one is common?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7vib?context=5)|Well, that's a tough question. Advancements are so swift but there has been so many failures. The last company that did this was Abiomed, and after 5 patients they stopped their trial. The hard part is not making an artificial heart that can pump but adjusting it to match the response of the body.  There are some studies done by universities by individuals, but it will be a good 20 years before it becomes common. Especially if you consider how long it takes to do clinical studies and prove it's efficacy to regulatory bodies.
[I'm just entering an undergrad degree of Biomedical Engineering. I'd like to ask you a personal question though. Are you content with the work that you do?   Might I also ask for some advice, to any student starting their degree in BioM, if it isnt too much trouble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w91md?context=5)|I'll just say this, someone I was in study group with in undergrad, is making sprinklers. There are people walking around with my implants in them, keeping them alive, yeah I'm pretty satisfied.  Advice: most of stuff you learn in school you'll never see again, but keep your GPA up and do internships. If you can't find one, see if your school is doing summer research, anything will get you somewhere.
[Could you not just use some sort of adaptive control scheme to handle the variation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9hx8?context=5)|Then those sensors will have to plug into all over the patients body, from kidneys, head, liver, etc etc. Just too invasive.
[But isn't very easy to modify pressure using turbine than with some kind of pump?  And is having two turbines a very good fail safe considering one can support the body by itself, especially as there seems to be room?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wc4bn?context=5)|I think that person that was implanted died shortly afterwards.  Modifying pressure is pretty much the same, I don't think one is especially easier with another, it's adjusting the controller. one pump is for your lungs, another is for your body, so they are two devices. It's not backup of each other. Now your chance for failure just went up twice as likely.
[I am a medical student doing research now for a CT surgeon.  What devices type of devices do you work on?  What devices are considered hot items now to develop due to lack of market or inadequate devices? Things I am familiar with include artificial valves, grafts/artificial aorta, VADs, artificial hearts. Are there any other items that you are working on that are not being used at all?  Any technology developing stem cell grafts for MI or other heart damage? Some ideas might be artificial veins for CABG or new stent technology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9a3t?context=5)|The device I work on are cardiovascular device, something that is novel and not on market. The hot devices are usually the ones that follows the money. So things like cardiovascular, orthopedic, and things to keep patients out of hospitals. The devices that will become huge in the near future, the next gen, are TransAorticValveImplant/Heart sensors/Heart failure devices. I'm not an expert on stem cell grafts but definitely a lot of effort in research universities and private corporations.
[Are you assigned project individually or is usually a team effort?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7vvr?context=5)|The projects are team effort, there are so much to do, ranging from design, testing, manufacturing, documentation, pre-clinical trials, regulatory approval submission, clinical trials.   If you break the projects down, to a piece of plastic piece, that'll be individual, but usually people are hired to do specific work. So there's a guy who's good at plastics, another good at welding, another good at testing, etc etc.
[Do you know what hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is? If so, with what you're doing, is there any way to fix it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8u08?context=5)|I know what it is, think of basically the heart becomes thicken and inflexible, so it is less efficient in pumping blood, and have to work harder, and it's a downward cycle. My work doesn't address it, but there are implantable heart pumps (Left Ventricular Assist Device [LVAD]) that are addressing it. So far it's been a bridge to transplant device, but the more it is used, the more doctors and engineers are able to convince regulatory and insurance that it's a device for a larger patient population.
[Do you think your company does a good job monitoring your devices once they're in use?  Do your practices exceed the FDA's limited requirements? Would you feel responsible if one of the devices you've designed hurt someone because of a design flaw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w98v7?context=5)|Mmm, I would say no. We do monitor but in general FDA does not necessarily require post-monitoring. FDA will require post-monitoring for a period of time when in clinical trial, but not when it goes on market. They've been considering it but there's a huge push back from the industry. Yeah, I would feel responsible. You can't walk away from it, especially since there are a number of required steps to diagnose and deal with the issue. The second worst thing that can happen to a product is someone dies and the way to fix is is impossible. The worst thing is nobody knows why it killed someone.  I will also mention, the category of cardiovascular disease, is very complex. Nobody has just 1 disease, usually it's a long and complex journey of how the heart is now sick. So the category of patients I deal with, end stage heart disease, usually have other causes of death that's not related to our product, and it's still has to be explained and justified.
[Have you seen this TED talk? What do you think about the rush to make some of these types of devices and give them wireless connectivity without fully exploring and understanding the inherent susceptibility of these systems and necessity for well thought out security to be designed into these devices from the beginning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w97mq?context=5)|Sure, just like someone can get a RFID tag reader, someone can get a medical implant RF communicator and hack it. Pacemakers have this ""wand"" that is waved over the device, to control and adjust the programming. Company rep and doctors does this all the time. This is nothing new, a ""rogue"" doctor could do the same, just use the device and reprogram it. Question is, why would you want to. Is the world out to get you? A bullet from a gun would be easier.
[How difficult is replicating the AV, SA and Purkinje systems? Do you think we'll ever see a fully self-contained artificial heart? Or, will we always rely on fail-safe externals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8unb?context=5)|Well, in a way, it is done already with the pacemaker. Where leads are placed near AV node and lead down to Purkinje system. There are some stem cells studies done, to see if it will regenerate, so maybe that would be the future.  I think it was around 2005, there was the Abiomed Abiocor totally artificial heart, the system was totally implantable with induction recharging system. It's in trial to be commercially available now.
[If cats always land on their feet, and toast always lands butter side up; if I strap a piece of buttered toast to the back of a cat, hold the cat upside-down in the air, then let go of it, will the cat spin in place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8ys9?context=5)|No.
[Please elaborate...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9hhe?context=5)|It won't spin in space.
[I'm an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering student who would like to continue to a Masters in Biomedical Engineering. Our ME program is very much vanilla ME, but I'm working with a professor in our Biomedical/Osteopathic department to do research in pancreas cells for diabetes on the side.  I'd really like to work in research and design for prosthetic limbs/organs, and human augmentation in general.  Is there any advice you can offer on getting into the field from those initial conditions? I'm trying to find good co-op job(s) for my junior year; can you recommend any companies to look into?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8yss?context=5)|I don't know of any large companies that does prosthetic limbs/organs, so most likely you'll be in a startup when you get out of school. Possibly relocation, if you're okay with that.  Sounds like it's in the areas of Tissue Engineering that you're interested in. If you check back, I'll have a few company names that are looking expanding and hiring. One misconception is that people think they need a biomedical degree, grad or undergrad, to do medtech, not true. Medtech has been around for 4 decades and oldest biomedical programs are about 20 years old. So if you'd like to try and apply to these companies, I wouldn't let a graduate degree stop you.
[I'm currently looking for a job, I've got a BME bachelors, and have been working for a couple years now (mostly contract work). I've heard that Southern California is like the haven for biomedical companies due to the high concentration of companies. Do you know of other places to look? Thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9jom?context=5)|Yup, I would look in San Diego, San Francisco. If you're open to other states, I would say Boston, CT, NJ, and Minneapolis.
[I am receiving an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering (with a minor in CSE). I have market analysis experience, am currently participating in BIOMOD 2012 (International DNA Origami competition) and am doing clinical cancer image analysis. I have had past experience with various other things - and am currently a webmaster for 3 separate websites.  My current emphasis is on nanotechnology but it appears as though this is a field that is very slow moving due to regulations and so on. Could you give your interpretation of nanotechnology in Biomedical Engineering? If possible, could you tell me if, from your experience, I require a MS to specifically work in Nanotech? I have the opportunity to talk with a department head of Bio-nanotech for a huge company (Think P&amp;G) and so I will probably have a closer insight into this so feel free to skip over this specific question unless you know something specific that might be of use.  Other than that, could you give some company names worth looking into for employment after graduation? I would love to get my hands deep into nanotechnology with an undergraduate degree but everything I've heard is that I need a master's or even PHD? As an undergraduate, could you tell me what my workload would be like?  As one other thing, do your jobs typically vary? Like in one instance, are you doing specifically animal testing and in the next, doing laboratory work, or even in the next doing computer work or is it strictly to your specific qualities, so like in my case, I am very, very good in computers so I will probably be doing mostly cubicle coding work?  Also, did you have any time between getting an undergraduate and getting a graduate degree where you did work, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3waqb1?context=5)|I don't really see any business development around nanotech. Probably only for surface modification or Stainless steel NiTi metal mesh. I would probably do a Biomedical Engineering Masters and focus on biomaterials and biocehm. That would probably be worth focusing.  As for company names, I wouldn't even know where to start for nanotech. Maybe some kind of medical fabric company, but most of those are dying and leaving the country.  Yeah, every day is different, I would do a little of each. It really shifts things around.
[Sounds like you're mostly R&amp;D? Is that correct? I've been leaning towards going to that area myself. Quality/Validation/Regulatory doesn't interest me. How much of a salary difference is there between R&amp;D and the rest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wdo87?context=5)|Yeah, I'm more of early stage R&amp;D, it fits well with my creativity and knowledge base. Basically get a problem to solve and prove it in a patient. Of course, many steps in between those two points.  I think R&amp;D has the advantage here in terms of salary, but companies are always looking for good QA people to hire. But in terms of path to success, I think it's in R&amp;D and marketing.
[I'm a biomedical engineer in my sophomore year of college, and I feel like all the classes I'm taking now are really hard, even though I know the concepts already.   1) What did you do when you felt like things were difficult for you? 2) Are there more of any one gender where you work than the other? 3) Did you go to med school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w97rh?context=5)|I think I just stopped taking them, haha, it's good to ask seniors what classes to avoid. Yeah, more male than females, but it's 60/40, and trend is tipping. Nope, thought about med school but wasn't what I wanted to do.
[Is there a benefit to getting an MBA following a masters degree in BME? As far as getting into a product development or project management role?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9y4h?context=5)|Yes and no. I think MBA is over-valued, isn't stopping me from considering it though. But a MBA fits in well with large medical companies, that does more marketing, operations, management.
[I'm graduating in the Spring (BS BME, Tissue Eng. &amp; Biomaterials) but am having a hard time finding somewhere to work. When you say you got a job through a recruiter, do you mean a recruiter from the company that hired you or a head hunter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9g5y?context=5)|I applied through Monster.com, where a recruiter found my resume, and gave it to a startup. Not a bad business, recruiting, haha.
[Any tips on finding a job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9g5y?context=5)|Believe it or not, Monster.com.
[I'm graduated last July with my bio engineering degree... I'm working retail now, any suggestions on how to find a job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9cyi?context=5)|Are you willing to relocate? Try looking for jobs in Boston/NJ/San Diego/SF/Minneapolis market.
[Where are most of the medical device companies located in the US? California and Minnesota?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9iy7?context=5)|And Boston, NJ, Miami, San Diego, San Francisco.
[Why are you keeping Dick Cheney alive??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9iab?context=5)|I find it creepy that he is flaunting it.
[Any advice for a senior in high school interested in this field and attending pre med in the fall? I want to do medicine but there are so many aspects of it that I'm worried I may pick the wrong field and be unable to find a job after grad school.   Also what medical teaching institutions do u highly respect or recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9ae0?context=5)|Mmm, well, if you are thinking about medical school, by aspect/field, do you mean specialty? If so, I wouldn't worry about it, because between now and college and med school, you'll have so much time to choose and find out what you want to do. But I would not pick pre-med as my major for medical school, consider engineer, down side is, it's usually tough to keep the GPA higher than 3.5.
[Follow up question... have you found your job to get harder or easier as time went on? Did your job get more or less rewarding as you went on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wchma?context=5)|I'm 33 with 8 yrs of experience, as a product manager. I still do design stuff but do more product management. My involvement with engineering is more early stage stuff, once it's going to manufacturing I try to stay out of it. It's sometimes high pressure, it's not for everyone, but I don't think it's unbearable. It's a clash of personalities and sometimes you're better off sitting back and letting it play out. I've learned tricks and trade to make my job easier, like I tell my friends, a well trained monkey can do 80% of my job.
[Are there any internships you could hook me up with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8mco?context=5)|Sorry, we're not hiring interns this summer. Small startup with limited resources. Good luck with your search!
[I'm in college and thinking about either Materials with a specialization in Biomaterials or Biomedical. What is the job market like for BME?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9pja?context=5)|I don't know much about materials, except that there is no perfect material, so the search goes on, I bet the market is pretty good in that regard.   Job market is better than others, I would say. The downside is, it's very concentrated on certain cities, so if you're a biomedical engineer in Alaska, Hawaii, NDakota, you get the point, you're screwed.
[High school senior here looking to become a biomedical engineer - I'm by far a science/math person and molecular bio is my favorite. Do you think I'll have the opportunity to not learn about prostheses and implants and just concentrate on cellular/molecular/tissue work as a biomedical engineer? Or should I go for just a degree in biochemistry and see where that gets me? Any advice is more than welcome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9oml?context=5)|Hi, I think that when you consider your courses and major, you'll have a chance to see what classes are offered. Universities differ, some will offer one but not other, all depends on the Professor. But, at the end of the day, if you're passionate about something, you can always do research of volunteer for an institution that'll give you the leg up on competition, more than any course will.
[I'm a sophomore at Miami University majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I want to work with prosthetics and improve upon the way that they interface with the human nervous system. Couple of questions: 1) What is the job market like for biomedical engineers? 2) What company do you work for? 3) Do you know of any company internships provided through your company or possibly others that maybe you interned at? 4) Any advice for an up-and-coming biomedical engineer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wcbp9?context=5)|Great school, job market is good, I currently work for a startup medical device company, sorry too small to offer internships (besides you want a big company that's around when you apply for a permanent job), talk to your Professors to network, and find out who's recruiting at your school.
[Awesome, thanks! and feel free to not answer this one if it's rude but what was your starting salary out of school and how much room is there for advancement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wd9ft?context=5)|70K out of school, lots of room for advancement. Good luck :)
[Cool, one of my friends is studying BME (Purdue). A lot of the stuff he's doing is really neat.  My question for you is, what made you decide BME over other engineering degrees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9j1n?context=5)|I was fascinated by medicine and I was an engineer, so I settle for the middle ground. Thank goodness I didn't go to medical school.
[What subjects did you need for you biomedical engineering course, and where did you go to university/ collage?  also what country did you study in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9pc2?context=5)|US, MechE for undergrad, Biomed for grad. I think biomed courses included biochemistry, hemodynamics, numerical methods for tissue, topics in prototyping. etc. Most were worthless.
[Thank you that is very useful, but i misspoke, when i said what subjects did you need, i meant to say (and should have included) what subjects did you need to have already studied before they let you take the course?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa89a?context=5)|Surprisingly, nothing, no requirement  oh, also in the US for both schools.
[How do you account for endocrine or nervous system induced signals necessary to change cardiac output in order for a human to adequately respond to its environment?   Obvious heart implant patients are not running marathons, but even some basal level of regulation seems necessary for daily activities for this to ever be considered a viable option.  Has biomedical engineering gotten to the point where we can place, lets say, beta 2 receptors on artificiality grafted cells on the devices surface which are competent for endogenous signaling and can translate that information to the artificial pump? Rather than placing sensors or something mechanical everywhere on the body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wagpb?context=5)|Answer is no. That's why artificial hearts and LVAD patients, have to be closely monitored and parameters of output adjusted. When I worked on artificial heart floor, we had to monitor the patient every hour, and if out of whack get a doctor to agree to changes, granted that was a long time ago.
[I mean no troll, but what is your stance on religion?  I ask because my ex's Mother oversees the installation of said valves, and she is a devout Catholic, giving no credit to science and all to god for the miracles he has given.  I mean, whatever you want to believe, but I find it hard to believe that people who work in a 'hard' science field, producing and installing artificial organ components can look past all of the work and ideas that go into the process.  Do you have any insight on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wjjod?context=5)|She oversees them? in what capacity? As a doctor, clinical coordinator, manufacturer? Well, as an atheist, I would say that these are imperfect implants with their faults and downside, if God wants to take credit for it, then go right ahead. But I usually find that arguing with people who doesn't listen to reason, is pretty pointless, I have a better time talking to a wall.
[Do you ever consult with top hospitals or those in private practice? If so which hospitals are you seeking to see the first to use these devices, and are you mainly consulting with cardiothoractic surgeons and cardiologists?   Secondly, what do expect insurance coverage for these devices to be for the average joe who needs a cardiovascular implant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wbe88?context=5)|I would say you should follow the doctors, see which doctors are most often on the news, they'll have experience using these devices and have support staff and systems in place. You need both Interventional Cardiologists and CT Surgeons. Afterall, when something goes wrong, CT surgeons will have to do the clean up and also can help with referral.  Can't really speak to the insurance coverage, I thought most are 80% covered.
[Are you my Uncle Tim?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9jsj?context=5)|Nope, sorry, good luck finding your real dad.
[An executive from Boston Scientific came to talk to my BME class about the business end of the medical device industry.  He remarked that most of the stents were produced in Ireland at a cost of about 90 cents per stent.  They were then sold to hospitals under exclusive contracts for around $1200 per stent.  I understand that most of that cost is needed to fund clinical trials necessary for FDA approval, but do engineers in the industry see a problem with the business end of things.  Is there any support for nationalized healthcare at the cost of slowing research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9ng1?context=5)|Well, you're talking about a stent, which is a fabricated from a piece of NiTi tubing about a inch long. Made by a government subsidized Ireland (no longer the case) company, and made in bulk. There are more high end medical devices out there. I'm no economist or business major, but I would say that $1200 is well worth the price compared to open heart surgery.
[I'm a BME Master's student at a good school, and I currently plan to pursue a PhD. Do you know anything about the industry market for cellular and molecular engineering as opposed to medical device design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9cgs?context=5)|With tissue engineering and stem cell, it's going to be the next explosion segment. I would say you're on a right path I wished my organic chemistry and cell biology was good enough to be in that path.
[How much do you make in base and bonus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w94zi?context=5)|110k + 10k annual bonus + stocks.
[I am have a Biology degree and am considering a Bioengineering MSc, would there be industry jobs for people of my background, or would employers want someone with more of an engineering background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9zby?context=5)|As someone who hires, I think people look at what you did last as the best indicators, so if you did Bioengineering masters, that'll be the degree. There are plenty of people who are science background and does Biomedical engineering, I don't think it's an issue.
[Can an implanted device run off the bodies power supply or do they always need their own power source?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3we4br?context=5)|So far nothing that I know of can run off bodies source, through either kinetic, thermo, chemical, or electrical. It's just such a small amount of energy that can be generated. There is a company though, called Cardiomems, that puts pressure transducers, usually stays dorment, but when near an induction power source, would power up and transmit RF info about pressure, pretty cool.
[This may be outside of your expertise, i don't know, but i ams  a patient facing the possibility of another heart operation. How long do you think it will be before we can non-invasively replace one of a patient's valves in the united states?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9f4t?context=5)|Sorry to hear that. It's already here, look into Medtronic Corevalve and Edwards Sapien. But these devices are for older patients and I don't know if you'll fit into that category.
[What are your thoughts on the Da Vinci and valve replacements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9xby?context=5)|Well it is not really proved to be any better than a surgeon. I think the conclusion was that the most damage was done when going on bypass. It's also risky if there's an emergency, where the doctor will have convert to open heart surgery very quickly.
[I would like to know how the inventing process goes. If you have some novel idea for disease treatment, does it belong to your lab? Say if you make a discovery, what happens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa9ub?context=5)|Well, it could be anything. Some times it's a doctor think of a way of doing something better. Or marketing report shows a unmet need in a segment. Or an entrepreneur would want to start a new company. So these would all eventually lead to a room of engineers and ask ""how would you solve this problem""

Since I've been looking for a paid internship in a different part of the country or abroad this summer, I decided to go through the interview process. The position, I learned, is basically a door to door educational textbook salesperson. It seemed super sketch, so I researched the company online. I've found testimonies ranging from hailing the program as ""one of the decisions you'll ever make"" to blasting it as a scam and a cult. I'm definitely skeptical about the internship now, but on the other hand I can see the possible benefits from joining the company. So, I decided to post on reddit to see if anyone here is familiar with the program, and hopefully advise me on one way or another.

I need a serious kick up the ass guys,  this can't go on. Its beginning to affect my relationships with other girls. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I cant stress that enough. I want her out of my mind and I think I've taken it as far as I can by myself. 

Backstory: We were seeing each other for about 5 months (I know, pathetic right?) she was an intern at a job I had just started. I started getting suspicious about 2 months in. Turns out she was sleeping with her ex boyfriends best friend the entire time we were seeing one another.

I found this out after discovering the math didn't add up on a box of condoms I had just opened 2 nights before. I called her out on it and she confessed everything. I told her it was over then and I know that was the right thing to do.

But she tried to make me feel like a dick for making a big deal out of it. Because apparently we were ""just friends who slept together 6 nights a week"". Texts/insults/random make up sex continued sporadically for the next month or so. Didnt help matters that I had to see her at work every day for that entire perioid.

She ended up dating the other guy long term. I really don't care about that at this point. I just need to get her out of my mind. I don't need this leech on my self esteem anymore. I keep thinking about what a fool I made of myself and it's affecting my confidence with other women. I dont want this shit in my life anymore. 

Like I said I fullly believed I was in love with her at the time but now I realise it was just an unhealthy obsession that I need to forget.

Sorry about the wall of text but I've had a bit to drink and I'm fed up with my scumbag brain making me think about this shit every day.

All my life I've been told that I should do something with my art and my ideas. The astonished statements, the furtive questions-- ""What are you doing working at Walmart when you can draw like that?"" ""I had no idea you could draw so good! Why don't you go to art school?!""

I've never had any idea what to do with my creativity and talent until recently, however. I didn't really see any money in comic books. I definitely didn't want to be a tattoo artist. I'm not quite good enough at math to be an architect. And outside of my own scope on the matter, I had always heard the stereotypes: people complaining that their art degrees were useless, that there were all kinds of homeless people on the streets with the paper and the creds, that there were art school graduates with loan debt and no art job to pay it off with.

Add to that the environment that I was raised in; my whole family has been up to its eyebrows in general labor. Factories, namely. Textile manufacturing, power plants, automobile assembly... you name it. ""Hard work"" belonged on my family's coat of arms, if we'd had one. If you didn't have a job putting something together in a dim and dirty roomful of shuddering, slamming, booming machines, twelve hours a day, six days a week, you were a slacker, lazy, good-for-nothing.

I ended up with a pretty heavy case of depression in high school. What good was this supposedly prodigious talent with no one to share it with and nowhere to apply it? I went to art class every day, where I made straight As of course, and every day stared down our sad sack of an art teacher, who spent nearly every class hiding behind his desk, drawing Time Magazine cover arts that would never see the light of day. I didn't want to be that man.

One day I received a certificate from the National Creative Society deeming me a ""Mentor of Poetry, Prose, Art, and Performance"". I was proud of it--still am, to a degree, but when I saw how envious that art teacher was of it--practically threw it at me when he gave it to me that afternoon in art class--I couldn't help but want to avoid seeing myself in that same chair, hiding behind that same desk.

I tried to write a fantasy novel, but I knew it would be an uphill battle trying to get it published, and the rewards would be slim, if any. So after a couple years of trying to hold down a flighty retail job, a handful of creative false starts, and a failed marriage, I decided to join the Army. What better way to get out of the doldrums of the backwoods and away from a destiny under a carpet-weaving machine than jump into a life of excitement, experience, and travel feetfirst?

Several years passed. I had met and married again, changed jobs from my original MOS as Military Policeman to 'Transportation Coordinator', and deployed to Afghanistan with a new unit in a logistical job moving and tracking enemy movements, ambush incidents, and shipment convoys all over west Afghanistan. It was a hell of a time, and I'd gladly do it again in a heartbeat--but it turned out that while I was on the other side of the planet, my new wife had grown used to my absence and developed a seven-year-itch in three months. And up until I walked in the front door of our house, I thought we could still work things out...we had been talking online, talking about the future, talking about promises and compromises, about how we'd each changed for the better, and how we were going to start over and do things right.

I walked in the front door of our house at the end of my deployment and all of her stuff was gone. But it didn't really hit me until I walked into the living room and saw the blinds I had put up while I was home on leave back in April. The big picture windows in the living room were so big and empty, and there was no shade and she couldn't put them up herself, and I felt so helpless--I had been gone so long and left so much of the stateside business to her, that I had to put up all the blinds. I needed to do something for her, to do something stateside, even if I couldn't be here to protect her at night in that creepy old house when she was there all by herself, or take care of her when she was sick, or take her out to eat for her birthday, two of which I had missed. I could put up the blinds. That, at least, I could do.

I walked into the living room and saw the blinds I had put up just for her, and she wasn't even here to use them, and I withered inside. After she fled to North Dakota with her new boyfriend, I stayed in the house a few weeks while I job-hunted, completely confused as to what to do until my mother offered to let me stay back home for a little while again.

I'll never forget how hard I cried driving back to Georgia with everything I owned crammed into the truck that my new ex-wife had abandoned. She had completely dropped every thread of the life we'd shared for the last several years, and left me up to my eyeballs in debt: the truck I was driving, she'd purchased while I was overseas. A car she tried to purchase after I told her to leave the truck with me instead of somewhere I couldn't find it. We hadn't even taken possession of the car.

When I got to Georgia, the job search didn't go any better. Literally thousands of resumes emailed, dozens of job websites trawled every day: a few interviews, but nothing promising. And I'd had such high hopes for landing a job in logistics. It had seemed such an important field when I did it in Afghanistan. Everybody needs something shipped, right? I had my nose in everybody's business over there; I could find a needle in a haystack from space, and tell you where it would be in twelve hours. My nickname was ""The Eye of Sauron"" because if something happened in my Area of Responsibility, I knew about it.

Three weeks after I returned to Georgia, I was at work, third shift, running a industrial carpet-weaving machine for minimum wage, twelve hours a night, seven days a week, when I had an epiphany.

Talent doesn't just ""go away"" just because you have been convinced that it is worthless. You are born with it. You are born TO it. You can run from it, but you can't hide from it. Stories still came to me, even though I hardly ever wrote anymore. I still got the mental movies you get when you daydream about the stories that come to you. I still got the faces, the clothes, the things they did, the things they said, my ideas. Everybody said I was better off now that she was gone; up until it hit me, I hadn't thought so. I had lost the most important person in the world to me. My whole purpose was gone, leaving yet another gaping hole. But maybe now it was time to let go and commit to what had been inside me the entire time, and use the unfortunate freedom I'd been pushed into to return to creative pursuits.

Games. I have always loved video games, and the best ones are the ones that you can lose yourself in. Slough off the stress of the day with a journey into the woodland heart of ""The Elder Scrolls""' land of Cyrodiil, or burn off some frustration fighting the mob in some crime caper game or some nameless aliens on a cloud-dappled plain. I decided that was where I wanted to tell my stories.

I need this. Funded or not, school or not, all I have left are my talents and my hard work. If I can't go to school and get the degree I need, I'll pour all my ideas into my portfolio and start looking for an internship or something. My pictures and my words, they tell stories, and the best place I can see to accomplish that is with a game developer. I want people to meet the quirky characters that appear to me as I'm standing there gazing into the shivering eighty-three needles of a deafening carpet machine. I want people to get lost in the exotic environments that appear to me as I'm trying to fall asleep at nine in the morning after work. I want people to see the worlds that I've been seeing for the last twenty years, and I need help to make that happen right. I need help being the creator I should have always been.

And outside of my own scope on the matter, I had always heard the stereotypes: people complaining that their art degrees were useless, that there were all kinds of homeless people on the streets with the paper and the creds, that there were art school graduates with loan debt and no art job to pay it off with.

Add to that the environment that I was raised in; my whole family has been up to its eyebrows in general labor. Factories, namely. Textile manufacturing, power plants, automobile assembly... you name it. ""Hard work"" belonged on my family's coat of arms, if we'd had one. If you didn't have a job putting something together in a dim and dirty roomful of shuddering, slamming, booming machines, twelve hours a day, six days a week, you were a slacker, lazy, good-for-nothing.

I ended up with a pretty heavy case of depression in high school. What good was this supposedly prodigious talent with no one to share it with and nowhere to apply it? I went to art class every day, where I made straight As of course, and every day stared down our sad sack of an art teacher, who spent nearly every class hiding behind his desk, drawing Time Magazine cover arts that would never see the light of day. I didn't want to be that man.

One day I received a certificate from the National Creative Society deeming me a ""Mentor of Poetry, Prose, Art, and Performance"". I was proud of it--still am, to a degree, but when I saw how envious that art teacher was of it--practically threw it at me when he gave it to me that afternoon in art class--I couldn't help but want to avoid seeing myself in that same chair, hiding behind that same desk.

I tried to write a fantasy novel, but I knew it would be an uphill battle trying to get it published, and the rewards would be slim, if any. So after a couple years of trying to hold down a flighty retail job, a handful of creative false starts, and a failed marriage, I decided to join the Army. What better way to get out of the doldrums of the backwoods and away from a destiny under a carpet-weaving machine than jump into a life of excitement, experience, and travel feetfirst?

Several years passed. I had met and married again, changed jobs from my original MOS as Military Policeman to 'Transportation Coordinator', and deployed to Afghanistan with a new unit in a logistical job moving and tracking enemy movements, ambush incidents, and shipment convoys all over west Afghanistan. It was a hell of a time, and I'd gladly do it again in a heartbeat--but it turned out that while I was on the other side of the planet, my new wife had grown used to my absence and developed a seven-year-itch in three months. And up until I walked in the front door of our house, I thought we could still work things out...we had been talking online, talking about the future, talking about promises and compromises, about how we'd each changed for the better, and how we were going to start over and do things right.

I walked in the front door of our house at the end of my deployment and all of her stuff was gone. But it didn't really hit me until I walked into the living room and saw the blinds I had put up while I was home on leave back in April. The big picture windows in the living room were so big and empty, and there was no shade and she couldn't put them up herself, and I felt so helpless--I had been gone so long and left so much of the stateside business to her, that I had to put up all the blinds. I needed to do something for her, to do something stateside, even if I couldn't be here to protect her at night in that creepy old house when she was there all by herself, or take care of her when she was sick, or take her out to eat for her birthday, two of which I had missed. I could put up the blinds. That, at least, I could do.

I walked into the living room and saw the blinds I had put up just for her, and she wasn't even here to use them, and I withered inside. After she fled to North Dakota with her new boyfriend, I stayed in the house a few weeks while I job-hunted, completely confused as to what to do until my mother offered to let me stay back home for a little while again.

I'll never forget how hard I cried driving back to Georgia with everything I owned crammed into the truck that my new ex-wife had abandoned. She had completely dropped every thread of the life we'd shared for the last several years, and left me up to my eyeballs in debt: the truck I was driving, she'd purchased while I was overseas. A car she tried to purchase after I told her to leave the truck with me instead of somewhere I couldn't find it. We hadn't even taken possession of the car.

When I got to Georgia, the job search didn't go any better. Literally thousands of resumes emailed, dozens of job websites trawled every day: a few interviews, but nothing promising. And I'd had such high hopes for landing a job in logistics. It had seemed such an important field when I did it in Afghanistan. Everybody needs something shipped, right? I had my nose in everybody's business over there; I could find a needle in a haystack from space, and tell you where it would be in twelve hours. My nickname was ""The Eye of Sauron"" because if something happened in my Area of Responsibility, I knew about it.

Three weeks after I returned to Georgia, I was at work, third shift, running a industrial carpet-weaving machine for minimum wage, twelve hours a night, seven days a week, when I had an epiphany.

Talent doesn't just ""go away"" just because you have been convinced that it is worthless. You are born with it. You are born TO it. You can run from it, but you can't hide from it. Stories still came to me, even though I hardly ever wrote anymore. I still got the mental movies you get when you daydream about the stories that come to you. I still got the faces, the clothes, the things they did, the things they said, my ideas. Everybody said I was better off now that she was gone; up until it hit me, I hadn't thought so. I had lost the most important person in the world to me. My whole purpose was gone, leaving yet another gaping hole. But maybe now it was time to let go and commit to what had been inside me the entire time, and use the unfortunate freedom I'd been pushed into to return to creative pursuits.

Games. I have always loved video games, and the best ones are the ones that you can lose yourself in. Slough off the stress of the day with a journey into the woodland heart of ""The Elder Scrolls""' land of Cyrodiil, or burn off some frustration fighting the mob in some crime caper game or some nameless aliens on a cloud-dappled plain. I decided that was where I wanted to tell my stories.

I need this. Funded or not, school or not, all I have left are my talents and my hard work. If I can't go to school and get the degree I need, I'll pour all my ideas into my portfolio and start looking for an internship or something. My pictures and my words, they tell stories, and the best place I can see to accomplish that is with a game developer. I want people to meet the quirky characters that appear to me as I'm standing there gazing into the shivering eighty-three needles of a deafening carpet machine. I want people to get lost in the exotic environments that appear to me as I'm trying to fall asleep at nine in the morning after work. I want people to see the worlds that I've been seeing for the last twenty years, and I need help to make that happen right. I need help being the creator I should have always been.

qf3al,6,2012-03-02,Could someone guide me a bit and answer some questions I have? (not technical questions),takk___,ASPNET,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASPNET/comments/qf3al/could_someone_guide_me_a_bit_and_answer_some/,"Okay so forgive me if this isn't the specific place I should be posting this.  I have seen other subreddits like /r/cscareerquestions but I thought this would be better.

I have a few questions regarding what I should learn and in what order, also if this is the right path for me.  Before that I will give you a bit of a background on me...

I am 24 and recently became laid off from my first Web Developer position out of college.  I graduated in 2010 with a bachelors degree in Information Sciences and Technology from Penn State.  In a nutshell the major exposed us to everything imaginable in IT, programming, project management, networking, UI Design, etc.  That was the good part.  The bad part is that none of these classes were much about ""the basics.""

I took an internship with a web development company and was eventually hired by them full-time after college.  I mostly took care of HTML/CSS emails, but I delved into the world of ASP.NET/C# and also Javascript for the first time here.

Long story short... one of the major clients we worked with got sold and all my work was gone.

Here I am unemployed, seriously attempting to learn skills to better myself in finding a job that I actually LIKE.  I have been interested in web development since I was in middle school and I will always be.  I just have some questions regarding if this is the right path for me etc.

1) I recently started reading a C# book to better understand it, but I hit a wall.  I get all the basics for the most part... mathematical statements, loops, if/else, and things specific to the world of ASP.NET in setting labels text, and on occasion I used table adapters with stored procedures to retrieve data.  However, I am to the point in this book (which is based around Windows Form Applications, not the world of web) where it is beginning to run away with the concept of objects.  I seem to understand the theories behind objects (inheritance etc), but I have trouble actually picturing a potential project in terms of objects.  How far into the C# world does one have to go in order to be proficient enough in the ASP.NET world?  I would like to think I don't need to know EVERYTHING, but I am probably wrong...

2) Because I generally hit these walls, the idea comes to mind that maybe this isn't for me and maybe I am not intelligent enough to be a Web Developer.  I had plenty of classes with CS majors that just seemed so far beyond my comprehension level, yet at the same time, none of them seemed interested in projects they were given.  Is this normal or do most people quickly move through C# books?  This sounds like a dumb question...

3) Now that I have been looking for a job, I am torn between front-end development and back-end.  Most jobs listed are one or the other and working for a small company, I had to do both.  I keep coming to the conclusion that maybe back-end isn't for me, but then I really find it rewarding when I figure something out.  On the same side, front-end development seems easier, but it is a major headache having to deal with different browsers etc...

4) Now that I have all the time in the world until I find something (hopefully soon), what do you suggest I do?  I have taken to the ""Head First"" books by O'Reilly that I really enjoy.  So far I just finished SQL since it was a really easy read.  I am about 1/3 the way through Head first C# and I hit a wall.  I am also about 1/5 through Javascript and have purchased ""Design Patterns"" and ""Object Oriented Analysis and Design"".

I primarily used Web Forms at my previous job but would like to head into the world of MVC3 and Razor although I have very little knowledge of either...

Any help would be appreciated, sorry for the long post!

I graduated with a chemical engineering degree last spring I was told all through school about how much the US needed chemical engineers and that jobs were a dime a dozen. 

I have had a few interviews for technician (non engineering) positions one that I know I flubbed and the others they wanted people with more experience. 

I graduated with a 2.8 in my major due to being kicked out of school after my sophomore fall but talked my way back in for spring, that semester I was diagnosed with a learning disability and an IQ of 132. After the diagnosis, medication and accommodations my GPA increased from 1.9 to 2.7 cumulative avg with about 160 credits at graduation. During that struggle I was unable to take an internship over the summer due to taking classes each summer. I took the Chemical Engineering EIT Exam with about an hour of studying.

At graduations I have ~120k in loans to pay back and no job. I have no idea how in the world I can get a job, most places I have talked to either don't have positions open or they want people with masters and/or work experience. Today I was just told that a job which I would have been a perfect fit for was a no go and not given a reason. 

I am just wondering if anyone knows some resources other than places like CareerBuilder that I can look for jobs, know of jobs(through friends and/or family), have information about perhaps getting into a grad school, or even an internship that they are willing to share with me. I am feeling rather more depressed today.



tl;dr I need a ChE job/cheering up know of any?"

qevqm,2,2012-03-02,Help with liquid assets please,TheDoktorIsIn,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qevqm/help_with_liquid_assets_please/,"I have some money sitting in my checking account that I know I don't need access to right away, and I'm looking to get into investing.  I have a few questions that hopefully someone can help with.

I have about $22,000 in my bank account, and my plan is as follows:

I am currently unemployed (although technically a per-diem employee, I'm just not getting any hours) and living with my parents rent-free (I'm a lucky bastard, I know).  I have finished my master's degree, and am looking to 1.) gain an internship in the nearby city, 2.) get a job in research for a year, and 3.) go back to school for my PhD, which will take approximately 3 years (since I already have a master's, I'd be able to skip basically the first year of school).

I have three scenarios in mind:

* Get an apartment by myself (roommates aren't an option) for a few months for the internship, then move back home for the job in research
* Not have an apartment by myself for either the internship or job in research, live at home paying low rent
* Get an apartment for each

I feel that I'm in a good place to do any of these 3 options.  That being said, I'm considering either putting the maximum amount in a Roth IRA fund (which I'm not sure if I can do since I get a paycheck once in a blue moon), investing in the stock market (blue chips, or other ""safe"" investments), or just holding on to it.  I have no debt and my expenses are extremely minimal, maybe $100/month if that much.

If the stock market, what's the best way to go about doing that?  I've seen sites like e-trade, are those reputable?

TL;DR: Financial help, $22k in savings, very low monthly expenses and no debt, Roth IRA/stock market blue chips?"
qevml,1,2012-03-02,I am a history teacher and foreign aid worker looking for a teaching position.,[deleted],japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/qevml/i_am_a_history_teacher_and_foreign_aid_worker/,"Okay, so I am a Development Studies student (foreign aid worker) in the Netherlands about half way through my 20s.

For my study I am required to do a placement or internship that is both working in a agricultural setting and facilitating/managing a group.

I have desided, along with my counselor, to split this up into two distinct internships because my agricultural experience needs more work with me originally being more of a city guy. However finding agricultural work isnt a problem, I already have many potential employers lined up.

For the facilitating/managing a group part I though about going back to being a teacher. Before doing Development Studies I finished a study on teaching highschool history. I though it would be pretty cool to pick up my old job in a new setting. So this is where my question comes in, where am I going to find a potential position as a history teacher from september 2012 onward?

I thought it would be pretty easy to find with all the completely inexperienced people becoming English teachers overnight but that's just it. If you search for available positions that all you find, English teachers. And doing a Google search for anything like ""teaching history in Japan"" or ""history teacher japan"" just ends up with a bunch of unrelated pages.

Bonus info: I have been on holiday to Japan for a total of about two months over the last 2 years. However I do not speak the language beyond the most basic words.

Ohh, and one more thing: If anyone reads this and happens to know the awnser to my question but with the country name changed from Japan to say China, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam etc etc I am not picky about the location though I would like to go back to Japan."

how the fuck do you guys deal with this.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qeuk2/im_feeling_unqualified_for_the_field_i_want_to_go/,"This is not to the point. This is me venting. I like saying things. Read it or don't.

It's a terribly ineffcient way to conduct my job search, I know. But I find myself scouring the internet for openings. Sometimes a company or group will pop into my head, that I know deals in my areas of interest and perceived expertise. Inevitably I end up on their website, looking not only at opens but also at the profiles of people that currently work there. This is where it gets bad. 

For the entry level jobs and their measly 38k/year salary, I see people holding this position with a list of credentials longer than Ron Jeremy's cock. These people, they cannot be more than a few years older than me. I envy them, that they figured out so early what it is they want to do, that they immersed themselves in it, and that it has paid off, although perhaps not literally as I alluded to. 

Here is me. I spent 4.5 years in college earning a double major. Is it because I knew what I wanted to do? No. But its where my interests lied. It's what I excelled in. It's what I read about in my free time, went to see speakers on, went to class everyday and debated, and wrote hundreds of pages on. 

The summer between my freshman and sophomore year I went home and a friend of mine got me a summer job working in the production arm of 2 midsized concert venues. I did not major in music, nor concert production, nor anything related this position whatsoever. But it was my job because I like music and I liked the people I work with. Kill me. It was my job for five summers, and I am welcome back any time. I did not have the luxury of working for free for 3 months every year. How I wish I could have a parent bank roll me as I went off to do some prestigous internship in DC or New York or Boston. That wasn't my reality.

So I graduated. Oh shit. Lacking connections and any idea of where to start, and with a modest mountain of student loan debt looming, I took one of the first jobs that was offered to me. Its a sales gig. Its fucking terrible. I actually did quite well at it for a number of months. But as I soon realized that my passions lied neither in selling nor the products I started to see the futility of what I was doing, that it would not get me where I want to end up. So I shut down. Its a problem I've always had. I dive head first into things I like but not only do worse at things I don't like, I tend to brush them off completely. 

I can't compete with these people. I thought I could. I saw that only 30% of Americans over the age of 25 have at least a bachelors degree. I know that only a fraction of those are in my desired field. And I know that a percentage of those, despite having a college degree, cannot properly formulate a sentence. I've seen it. So what does that leave us with? 8... 9 people? Apparently not. 

I feel like I'm to young to give in, to work just for a paycheck as opposed to some semblence of desire. As the job market is being strangled I understand I am being pitted against people who have more experience but will accept almost any salary. I know that fairness isn't the name of the game, and yet I feel that I will be punished for my ignorance of reality as a 20 year old. 

I don't even know what my question is anymore. If it helps provide context I graduated with political science and economics degrees. One of them should have been math. I can do math. I want to get into public policy and research. Its nothing glamorous, but its what I like. Its also the chosen profession of people holding graduate degrees who ran state senate campaigns in their free time.

I landed a killer internship, and while I'm waiting on that starting I still need some money. 


My school contacted me with anther opportunity (again the killer internship is taking forever due to vacations and a few other things). 

For a bit of background:

Now, I am/was a freelance programmer for a while and am pretty familiar with it. It's just not for me, and while I do love it- it's not something I want to do forever. But, it's a job. The school is well aware it's what I do at present for work at the moment and got in touch over a few companies looking for somebody with coding knowledge looking for work.


My interview for one of them is coming up, and going by what both the school itself and the guy had said- he's only looking for 'female programmers' and employees. He claims (and again the school had also said) that 'women have a better eye for detail'.


I have some MASSIVE issues with this. Sure, it's work BUT I'm not about to encourage this kind of sexism. It would be an issue if it were stated that he was only looking for men, and the same holds true in this case.

Hell, at the very least- it's a chance to make a stand on something I believe in. 

So, there's that. 

So, tell me TwoX:

I have and always will be addicted to substances because they induce mania, which is what I'm really addicted to.  Starting with this spring semester at college, I decided to go cold turkey on all substances and become a straightedge.  This is the best thing I've done with my life probably in the past few years and I'm still astonished with the positive repercussions.  Last semester and pretty much all through college I struggled socially, academically, and with managing my illness.  Now, I am a double Psychology and Business administration major taking 19 credits as well as involved in 5 clubs/organizations on campus.  I have gotten an 85 or above on every test or assignment thus far and developed strong relationships with a few of my professors.  I have met at least a hundred new people through different social networks and have some girls interested in me again.  In addition, I rekindled relationships with close friends of whom I pulled away from.  I also no longer have a place to call home for complicated reasons, but that pushed me to find a paying job and I ended up (very likely) landing a paid internship in Industrial Organizational Psychology; Most of all, I feel like I have control back in my life.  I am no longer letting manic depression define my life so much as I am defining my life as a person who suffers from it.

I am doing an internship for my last semester at college. I am starting to talk to recruiters and HR departments from other companies in order to get a job. There is a very very low chance I could get hired where I am interning right now, since there might be an open position on things I do not know about, but could learn. 

I did not use a template, but I have relatives in HR that said it look fine before. I edited it heavily since then though. It was 2 pages before, included all of the labs I took as well as relevant class skills I learned. Also got rid of references and 1 of the jobs I had before (farm hand on a dairy farm is not really relevant..)

Let me know what you guys think!

qecth,13,2012-03-02,How the american dream is a just a dream for me and nothing else.,Gangstapb,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qecth/how_the_american_dream_is_a_just_a_dream_for_me/,"Hello Everybody,

This might come off as a huge rant from another unemployed college student. But I have to vent and only place I know is here on reddit. I am being embarrassingly honest and real. Please do read and comment. I desperately need help.
 A little background; I am an international student. I grew up in a third world country in a lower class family in a house some might say is unlivable, a hermits shack. My father literally earned and is still working at about $ 214 - $ 258 per month with which he supported 7 family members including my great grandmother who died 5 years ago; right at the time when I came to US to pursue my American dream. Only asset we had was some land which my dad sold to send me to here. I had exactly 4500 US dollars when I came here. Out of that $ 4500 after tuition, books and other miscellaneous college expense, I had $ 200 left for rent, food and everything else. I was eighteen when I came here. I was not the Einstein of the class but I studied diligently. I worked 18 hours a day in summer to make up my years tuition. I am proud to say that I have not a penny that I owe as student loan, as a matter of fact; I don’t qualify for student loan for being international. 

College was not easy. I had hard time choosing what to study. I always liked computers and science in general. I enrolled in CS as a freshman and found out that I didn’t like programming much then I heard about chemical engineering and how much money I could make. I have been economically deprived for all of my life so naturally I was attracted to the money. At first I did not know what I was getting into. Chemical engineering is not a walk in the park. The subject matter is complicated and hard to understand. It felt like a big mistake but I was still making good grades in class. In my sophomore year I started applying for internships along with my class mates. Some of them got the internships and some didn’t. I didn’t get one either; reason I didn’t have permanent residency. Then came junior year and time to apply to internships once again. Now this time people who got internship were 98% of the class excluding me and 2 fellow internationals. Still I did not lose hope. Then came senior year and by the semester we were to graduate; all of the American students had jobs lined up except for me and 2 fellow internationals. It was obvious.

Now it has been a year since I graduated and I still have not found a job. I have even applied for permanent residency. I thought this would solve the problem but in vain. I have revised my resume hundreds of time. Tailored hundreds of cover letters. Basically followed every guideline by the book. No response at all. While I have had a very few people inquire about me, they brush off as soon as they hear I do not have any experience not even internships. I come out as a person who does not really fit their criteria. But the truth is far from what they think. Through the years that I have worked so hard. I have learned to love Chemical engineering. Everywhere I go I am constantly thinking about solving different problems using engineering. A passion for engineering itself has grown inside me. Now I cannot think of doing anything else except for engineering. Nowadays I dream of having a job. And it is really sad that in the dreams too I do home works and write lab reports and stuff because I have never been really exposed to a working environment and my subconscious think that work is same as homework from class.

Truthfully, I am very depressed. I am generally unhappy all the time which is totally opposite of what I am. I am always angry at my wife for stupid reasons. Life feels miserable and I feel like a disappointment to my father, my history and me. The only way I can feel complete again is to work as an engineer. I have lost my self-belief and confidence. If I don’t find a way out of this then it might be too late to get my parent out from the hermit shack. I want to get then a nice house and a comfortable life before their time. They are already in their old age and still living in struggle. I owe everything to their sacrifice and life that I have would not be possible without them. But alas, here I am 26 years old chemical engineering graduate without a job, ashamed of myself and desperate for help.

qebw4,0,2012-03-02,Just a timid guy who knows multiple programming languages...,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qebw4/just_a_timid_guy_who_knows_multiple_programming/,"So, I've been programming for about 5 years. I know Visual Basic, PHP (mySQL included), and JavaScript very well. I am experienced with HTML and CSS. I have dabbled in Java and C++. An internship would probably teach me more than I can learn on my own. I don't know what I need to know.

I have no work experience. I am self taught, although I am attending college just for the degree. I know I'll be a great programmer when I get experience. I've always been to go-to guy for my hobbyist game development group when things get complicated. I've developed a web site ([Site](http://www.triblox.org)). I've written systems for our game to track statistics (log in, kills, achievements). I know I have potential... I just don't know what to do with it.

I'm afraid my self-taught nature will not transfer well into a job. I want an internship but I need to make enough money to live on my own (probably would be taking care of someone else too, who won't be able to contribute money). I am a recluse and will be very nervous.

I feel that it is time to get out there but I have no idea where to start. I want a company willing to train me. With my loyal nature... I wouldn't leave the company as long as I am treated right. I don't know how to prove I am a good investment.

All in all, life is closing in. I need to move out of my parents house, get my foot in the door of a company. Start a career. I'm ready for it.

I just feel so small. "

Recently I have had a course TA for one of my courses, who I think is the most amazing girl I have ever seen! She is an international graduate student from China!
The moment I saw her, I felt that I have to be with her, so contrary to my introvert image, I approached her and asked her name and booked a meeting with her for some course doubts. Although I ace the course, I still wanted to meet her so I made up random doubts and asked her. This happened for couple of times and I added her on facebook. After a few chats I got to know that she loves action movies (made me fall for her even more :D), so I asked her out for a movie for Valentine's day evening, she refused by saying that she has to go for a party at a friends house and this term she is writing her thesis so she is a bit busy, but she thanked me for asking her :S

I felt immense anxiety through my veins, and thought I would give up on her as clearly she is not interested! But I could not  focus on other things, so i tried to talk to her again, found out that she is looking for a job and since she doesn't have North American Work experience she is facing problems. Now because of my internships I had some contacts so I said I could help her out and she said sure, now I have got her an interview from a big company. We met a couple of times after that (mainly attending company info sessions) and chatted for a good 5-6 days everyday before going to bed, talking about each other.
She asked about my school project and was impressed and asked if she could join it for some experience, as expected I agreed :P
I have my exams these days so I can't really get to meet her, but I plan to meet her to prepare for her interview and explain my project in more details to her.
I have tried a lot in hinting her that I REALLY REALLY LIKE HER, but I am not sure how much did she understand! I even did not sleep for 30+ hours so that I could do my midterm studying and help her out for getting an interview (ofcourse she doesn't know :P), hence I know I am very much in love with her :D I even started learning mandarin and watching mandarin shows!
Now there is this other guy who I think is after her and since he is a grad chinese guy (grew up locally), I feel he might have a better chance !
I am not sure when and how should I tell her that I really LOVE HER! PLEASE REDDIT PLEASE HELP :S

EDIT: Forgot to mention that when we meet, she is usually cheerful and laughing at my jokes, so I guess she doesn't feel awkward around me :s"
qe9xv,11,2012-03-02,I just realized that happiness is the exception not the rule for my life.,thewrongwire,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe9xv/i_just_realized_that_happiness_is_the_exception/,"First off, I'm not suicidal I don't think, so if it's wrong for me to post here I'm sorry, but I'm confused. I don't want to die...but death doesn't scare me. If I found out I had 24 hours to live, I think I would feel relieved. Like the burden of pressure to do something amazing with my life is lifted. I feel like Kirstin Dunst's character in Melancholia if anyone has seen it. I sometimes wish it would kind of just happen in a way out of my control. Like riding down the highway, I imagine a large truck smashing into my car...or if I'm flying I kind of hope for the plane crashing into the ground. 

I'm 27 and probably the most depressed I've been in my life. It seems silly though. I've read some of the other posts here...people have had challenging lives. Nothing bad has ever happened to me. The worst things are I've always been fat and I went bald. Shitty but nothing like what other people went through. For the past few months I've wondered: why am I so depressed all of a sudden? I had a few theories, but the more I thought about it the more I realized I've never been truly happy. I don't mean I'm sad 100% of the time. I have friends. I have fun. I lead a pretty normal life, I guess.

I can honestly list of the few periods of my life I was really happy (isn't that weird?):

* The moment I got my acceptance letter from a top 20 school to midway through 1st semester of college. I just felt like...the entire world was open to me. But now I realized I'm too stupid/lazy to accomplish anything.
* A summer internship where I roomed with my friend best and we lived without a care and the future seemed so bright. It was the best summer of my life.
* My last semester of college the moment I got a great job offer and had 4 more to choose from until about 6 months in and I realized I picked the wrong one :(
* Getting [and accepting] a really high paying job at a prestigious company last year despite thinking I bombed the interview. I was pretty happy for about 4 months, but I think it just because I was so busy moving, meeting new people, working that depression seemed to take a back seat.
* The night and week after where I got my first kiss and lost my virginity at 26. I finally felt like a man.
* Reading a message last month from the girl of my dreams on okcupid who [for reasons I didn't and will never understand] wanted to meet me. I think she's the only girl I've ever connected with. But she lives kind of far and just wanted to be friends after the first date (was more of a casual meet really). I guess maybe she thought it could go somewhere despite her never being attracted to me. So I never saw her again. The other date I went on, I couldn't care less about the rejection, but I still think about her sometimes. I get mad at myself a lot. I had a shot and I blew it. If I had spent the years leading up to meeting her taking care of myself and not being fat and lazy maybe she would have liked me back.

I feel like my brain just isn't wired for happiness. It's faulty. Does anyone else feel this way? Did you get over it? Is there something I can do...something to hope for? I want to be happy. I really do. I just don't know how. :(

Every week, I tell myself THIS IS THE WEEK. I'm going to finally get my act together and stick to my much needed diet. And inevitably every week I go a few days and then fail.

Tomorrow I have an interview at the top company in my field. I've known about this for two fucking weeks. I should have prepared like crazy. This is literally an opportunity of a life time, but instead I did nothing. I spent my free time redditing, being depressed, porn, and crying. Why am I so fucking stupid?

Last year someone I knew pretty closely committed suicide. We were very close friends my first year at college, but drifted apart after that. We still kept in touch though. At the time, I was in one of my happy periods and I was so confused. I couldn't understand it. But now...yeah, I get it. He was a good friend. I miss him. I don't want anyone to miss me."

Reddit, is this foolish?",wannabe_animator,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qdute/considering_quitting_my_comfortable_engineering/,"I'm very sorry for the length, but here’s a rundown of my situation:

I’m in my early 20s, just out of college and almost done with my first year as an engineer for a big aerospace company. I make a nice salary, have great benefits, relatively few college debts thanks to academic scholarships, and generally live a very comfortable life.

Although I majored in engineering, I’ve always struggled in choosing between art and science as a career. I would describe my passion in life as art and animation, as ever since a child I would draw constantly and watch tons of animated films and shows. However, I am pretty good at science and math, and graduated with &gt; 3.9 GPA from one of the top engineering colleges in the country. Throughout my life, I focused on school, leaving my pursuits in art as a secondary priority.

Thing is, while I am good at engineering and do have a genuine interest in it, I began to realize midway through college that I might have made a mistake in my career choice. As cheesy as it is, after watching Toy Story 3 during my first internship, I realized that nothing could bring me joy like the thought of working on a such a beloved animated piece. Since then, I’ve taken a few introductory 3D animation classes, and while by no means a prodigy, I was told that I held some promise. Still, I held to engineering, determined to at least finish the degree and get a ‘real’ job before I make up my mind.

So here I am now, asking for your help. I know that given the economy and many other factors, many people would really like to be where I am right now. Yet, I feel empty inside, like my current lifestyle merely leaves me content, but that if I go down this road I will wake up one day and regret never reaching out for my dream. At the same time, I also feel guilty abandoning a job in engineering, as I feel I would be wasting my abilities in science and math for something that I’ve heard my coworkers dismiss as a ‘hobby, not a job.’ 

I’ve heard of online animation programs like Animation Mentor that I could pursue while maintaining a full-time job, but before I take the plunge I want to ask you, Reddit: Should I be happy where I am now, or should I take a chance and give up all that I have for a shot in the much riskier field of animation? And if I do take the plunge, what’s the best way about doing it?

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!

My work experience is lacking (only real job was as a student helper for University events) however my experience in leadership and teamwork is substantial.
Any advice regarding how I should approach structuring my CV or just any advice in general regarding summer internships would be much appreciated!

Thank you."

qgdnq,2,2012-03-03,[Intern] Masters HCI grad looking for internship (or intern-to-hire) in usability or UX,morkhabur,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/qgdnq/intern_masters_hci_grad_looking_for_internship_or/,"**Who am I?** 

- Masters grad in HCI (University of Michigan; April 2011); 
- Time since graduation: networking, learning, living/breathing, and breaking into the field of user experience (UX). 
- Currently: independent contractor introducing a small company to better UX practices - though they just want a stronger social media presence at the moment. It's not the best use of my skills, and I want MORE.
- Desired job title/responsibilities: **User Experience Researcher** or **Usability Analyst** (among others). 

**What am I looking for?** 

- a transitional program or an internship in UX or usability analysis;
- a company that actually understands UX and what its role is in design and product iteration;
- a place where I can use my experience in a team setting
- role to beef up my programming/coding proficiency &amp; confidence without losing my analysis/research ability (I know Java/JS, and have worked with C#, learning Ruby at the moment).

**What are my skills (among others)?**

- I'm strong on traditional research, but I also have plenty of design experience (including mobile, physical, systems analysis). 
- Design-wise, HTML/CSS, PHP/MySQL and the Adobe suite, particularly Illustrator - used mostly for wireframing and prototyping. 
- I've worked with engineers, developers, architects, and web designers, so I can speak the lingo and understand more of their fields. 

I stay active in the digital design and UX communities, constantly learning and integrating new ideas into current work.  I am a unique person with a set of varied experiences that help me understand design research and recommendations from various disciplines. 

Really, I just want to dive in and get to work creating powerful experiences to motivate behavior. If you'd like to work with me, send a PM and I can give you more details. 

Look forward to hearing from you!"

I am an American student that requires internships for college credit to graduate. I'm studying graphic design, animation and motiongraphics and there are some companies in Buenos Aires that I would be honored to have the opportunity to work for. I would need to have a paid internship to afford living there, and assuming I was able to land a paid position at a company, what sort of visas would I be looking for to work in the country? How much would I expect to pay in rent, groceries and other things?


Also, my Australian girlfriend would be joining me in Buenos Aires if I landed the position. What sort of jobs could she work? Would she be looking for similar visas as I would to work in Argentina?


Both of us have beginner Spanish speaking skills, but we're studying every day just in case! What's it like for non-native speakers in Argentina? Would she be able to get a job with minimal spanish? 


Really, what is it like to live in Argentina? How easy would it be to rent an apartment for a couple of months?"

qg768,1,2012-03-03,My 21st birthday.,[deleted],LastNight,https://www.reddit.com/r/LastNight/comments/qg768/my_21st_birthday/,"This was the night of my 21st birthday, during my summer internship in Chicago. I had been out with some friends from work, and at the end of the night around 2 the bars started closing and most of them decided to go home. The only two people left with me were Dave (who I actually knew from high school, a heavyset black guy with dreads, and yes he loves the herb) and his friend from class, Rob (who looks a bit like Jack Black, could maybe pass as his brother). Dave and Rob didn’t show up until around midnight, so they wanted to keep going and hit up a late night bar. We didn’t know of any places, so Dave calls up some random guy that he met last weekend who supposedly knows his way around.

The guy rolls up a little bit later, and he introduces himself as Micky. As soon as I saw this guy, I instantly got a weird vibe about him. He was this short stocky Mexican guy who had a slicked back haircut that made him look like a pedophile. We get into his car anyway, and end up going about just 3 blocks down from where we already were (felt stupid). There was hardly anyone in there, but we didn’t want to leave cause there was no other place open nearby, so we just went straight to the bar and started doing shots between us 4. We stayed for about a half hour, doing shot after shot, when Micky suddenly tells us that we should “go on an adventure”. I had no idea what this meant, but of course being drunk out my mind we were just like “YEA LET’S DO IT!!”

So we get back in Micky’s car, and this where things started getting fucked up. I passed out like 2 minutes after I got into his car, and when I wake back up I ask Micky where we’re going. He calmly tells us we’re going to get ourselves some COCAINE. At this time I was too fucked up to have that statement completely register in my mind, but I looked out the window and realize that we’re literally driving through skid row. It was seriously the shadiest, jankiest urban area I’d ever seen in my life. I look up at Rob in the front seat and I see him just slouched down at an awkward angle, basically as if he expected a drive-by shooting to happen at any second. I started slouching in my seat too.

The next thing I know, I wake up and we’re parked in front of Micky’s apartment. Now at this point I wasn’t sure what was going on. I was still fucked up and I didn’t remember actually seeing the dealer and going through with the transaction, so I thought maybe Micky was just joking about it the entire time. We go inside his apartment, which turned out to be much nicer than I expected. It was actually a really fancy, really huge place, and he told us how he lives there with his wife and kids who were out of town for the week. At that point I concluded he must’ve been just fucking with us; there’s no way he can carry on a coke habit with a family and still live in such a nice place. 

We all sit down on his couch, and Dave pulls out his bowl and his weed and he starts packing it. Right as he’s about to light it, Micky suddenly stands up, reaches into his jacket, and pulls out a bigass bag of coke, grabs Rob, and they just start doing line after line on the kitchen counter. Dave and I just kinda sit there staring at them, we look at each other, and we’re just like “No, we’re not about to do that.” We smoke the bowl ourselves, and go off to a corner to crash for the night, while Micky and Rob are still going at it. As I was trying to sleep I heard Micky yelling that he’ll make us breakfast. I’m worried that he’ll add extra ingredients.

The next morning we wake up, and I see Micky cooking breakfast with a huge smile on his face. Rob is just sitting there on the couch, and I notice he looks really nervous. We ask him what’s wrong, and he whispers to us “We really need to get out of here”. So we make up some excuse for Micky, telling him we gotta go and can’t stay for breakfast. Micky looks disappointed. 

Back outside, Rob starts explaining what happened. Apparently after Dave and I were passed out, Rob was coming down from his buzz so he sat down on the couch watching TV. Micky comes up and starts giving him a shoulder massage. Rob was fine with this at first, but then Micky started to breathe heavily into his ear.. All of the sudden he tells Rob to WHIP IT OUT. 

“…Wait, what?”

“He told me to whip out my dick.”

….. 

Dave and I comprehend this for a second, then we burst out laughing. Dave goes, “What the FUCK??? Why didn’t you knock his ass out on the spot, grab us, and then get us the fuck out of there immediately???” 

Rob stutters and says, “well I felt kinda bad for him cause his wife and kid don’t know that he’s gay, plus I only whipped it out for like 3 seconds and I didn’t let him touch it, that doesn’t make me gay does it?” 

“WWWHHHHAAATTT???” 

Rob: ""Please don’t tell anyone this happened.. I actually feel kinda sick to my stomach right now.""

And of course Dave and I made fun of him the entire way back home, and soon after told his cousin, who laughed his ass off.

The moral of the story: Don’t do coke, it’ll make you gay.

qg33y,4,2012-03-03,About to graduate with CS degree and I'm not sure what I want to do. I think want to do something that involves science. Any advice or ideas?,SnailHunter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qg33y/about_to_graduate_with_cs_degree_and_im_not_sure/,"My biggest fear is that I will end up in a job working on menial projects that I don't care about at all. That's how I felt at my internship this summer, where I worked on iPhone apps. It really wasn't fulfilling to me to work projects that I just didn't really care about. I liked the experience of learning, and getting better at programming, and there were moments where I really enjoyed the hunt of coming up with a solution to a problem, but I didn't care about the products I was working on at all. It became very draining to me after just a few months. I couldn't imagine being stuck in that kind of job for a few years. Or a lifetime.

My dream would be to do something in the sciences, working on advancing our understanding of the world in some way. My *real* dream job would be to somehow be involved with writing software used by NASA, or something similar. I would just love to be involved in any way with something like that. I also think I would enjoy working on any type of big project that would affect a lot of people's lives (like writing software that would control an underground subway or something like that). Those types of jobs sound really fulfilling to me, but I'm not sure what exactly my options are when it comes to these things with just a bachelors degree in computer science.



I've got a few questions:

How important is it to future employers that I get a job right out of college? Does it matter? Is it better to just get any old job to start out with than to wait and try to find my 'dream' job (or at least something in the same vein as it)? Also, does it look bad to jump around a lot in jobs, or is it seen as a plus for having that much more or a diversity of experience? 

My basic 'plan' right now is to just find a job (knowing my lack of experience will greatly hinder me from achieving my dream jobs right out of college), and if I end up hating it, just move on to the next one, all-the-while looking into finding a way to reach one of my ideal jobs. On the side, I want to be making my own projects, apps as well, and hopefully make a small amount of profit from those.



What kind of opportunities are realistic for me, as it comes to the types of dream jobs I listed above? What path would you recommend? Should I consider grad school? Does it sound like I maybe should've chosen engineering or a physical science to major in instead of computer science, given my aspirations? Please be brutally honest.

Would it be appropriate for me to ask one of my cs professors to meet up to discuss these types of questions? I feel like my advisor doesn't really help that much, and I have a professor in mind that I really look up to.

One more aside: I love math and I really like the theory side of computer science.  I love studying algorithms, and I'm taking a model-checking class right now that I find really cool. Are there any jobs I could realistically get that involve something like model-checking?

Any advice at all would be so very appreciated. I need some honest direction from people more knowledgeable than myself."

qg2kx,0,2012-03-03,In the Mind of Rush Limbaugh When Reading Sandra Fluke's Congressional Testimony,dichloroethane,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/qg2kx/in_the_mind_of_rush_limbaugh_when_reading_sandra/,"Alright Rush, you've got 15 million real American Americans working hard to build a better America listening to your every word with baited ears. Truly a great responsibility, no burden, rests on your shoulders to make this country great again. Let's see what we have here, ah, a congressional testimony from a one Sandra Fluke. That's kind of a silly name-- Damnit Rush, focus! For the future of America for our Lord and Savior's sake!

 

Well let's see, she's a Georgetown law student. Hmmm, if I remember correctly, students are exempt from the provisions in the Obama policy on employer-provided health plans and Georgetown currently includes contraception in its health plan[1]. She did her bachelors in feminism studies and is now looking to practice law in domestic violence. So Rush, you're dealing with a heavily biased feminist fighting legislation for which she is not technically a stakeholder. Awww, Limbaugh you're going to come out looking great on this one. 

 

http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/statement-Congress-letterhead-2nd%20hearing.pdf

 

Alright, so she makes a claim that contraception will cost a woman over $3000 dollars throughout all of law school, which is almost as much as one makes in a summer internship if they are doing a community service based law program. Well, Rush, it would seem your initial impulses that lawyers at top tier institutions make way more than $3000 in a summer is negated by the fact that she is on a public interest scholarship. Think, Rush, think, why is this statistic so unsettling? Come on Limbaugh, you didn't do that thorough literature review on the economics of birth control just to see how easily you can feel emasculated now did you? 

 

Ah, ha. She is using a cost time scale of 3 years and comparing it to a wage timescale of 3 months. Dear my lord and savior Jesus Christ, such statistical manipulation to fit your worldview is essentially a blatant lie. Now, if we assume that an insurance plan would cover birth control pills, which have a median cost of $35 a month but with insurance would be reduced to a $10 copay, it is safe to assume that uninsured birth control would cost about $1260 over three years[2]. She is crying doom and gloom over $25 dollars a month. Well either that number is wrong or her idea of birth control is popping copious amounts of morning after pills at $50 a pop. In that case, she would literally be having so much sex that she can't afford the contraception. Yeah Limbaugh, that line drives your point home. Make sure to include that one when this gets to your mouth. 

 

Alright, reading on, it seems she's going to try and bring up specific sad stories about women who need birth control. The first one is about a girl with ovarian cysts but she states that this is already covered because the treatment has nothing to do with preventing pregnancy. Then she uses a fear tactic to say what if this wasn't covered if the new legislation passes. Wow, that is literally not a point so I'm not going to address it. Okay, so her friend was sick but was denied coverage because the insurance company did not think she had proper symptoms. Again, this is a straw man argument. It does nothing to address the right of a religous institution to deny subsidizing a product that perpetuates a lifestyle under medical pretext that is against its beliefs while not fighting or preventing disease. Rush, your nation is too intelligent for you to be wasting your time addressing every straw man that your opponents throw at you. Skip this one too.

 

Alright, her last point is about a girl who got raped and thought that since the University didn't cover birth control, they wouldn't cover her going to a doctor to check for STD's. Well it turns out the University does do that and this feels like a fairly large stretch in order to invoke the emotional response from hearing of a rape victim in order to further this girl's political agenda. 

 

So basically, she just wasted two pages of paper trying to stir up emotion without ever really addressing the issue. Though she is not like any of the people in the examples she cited, she is looking to have government subsidized birth control to prevent her own pregnancy. This is a clear case of conflict of interest to use a group that genuinely suffers from a disease, ovarian cysts, for the purpose of controlling legislation that will offer you a direct personal gain at the expense of the taxpayer. Dear, son of Jehovah, the taxpayer is literally funding this girl's lifestyle. Bingo Limbaugh, you have yourself an air tight argument. Let's count those culture war chickens and send this argument straight to your mouth. It'll literally be a no brainer to articulate.

I'm back. I posted a few weeks ago looking for mid-level developers. Alas, my search has been fruitless. I've been given the go-ahead to look for 4 more students for part-time hourly internships. Here's what I'm looking for:

1) A serious love of coding. The more you enjoy writing software, the more I want to hire you.

2) You need to be graduating this year (May, Aug, Dec).. the reason for this is...

3) This is basically a trial run to a full-time hired position with salary/benefits. Basically, we'll try you out for a while, and if we like you and you do good work and show promise, when you graduate, we'll convert you. 

4) For part-time, we're looking for a minimum of 20 hours a week, but you can work up to 40 if you can manage it. This is great for spring break and/or all summer. 

5) We have huge office-wide bonuses and incentives for meeting office-wide goals on code drops. For example, in 6 weeks, we have our first big goal, for which the prize if we hit our code drop with the requirements needed is a $3000 bonus for everyone (of which part timer get a minimum of $1500, plus any more at my discretion if you've been kicking ass)

6) I'm the hiring manager. You'd be reporting to me. I have 13 developers working for me (Junior and Mid), of which 6 already are students. From the feedback I've gotten, they all love it. You might know some of them.

Here's the snippet about our company that I put in my last posting:

*A bit of background about us.. We're a company of about 500 people, and we do government contract work, but this particular office (about 55 people currently, ramping up to about 65) is all fixed-bid, so little government oversight (no security clearance or anything) and we're really well funded, so we have autonomy to solve the problems the way we want to solve them, which means top of the line hardware and software. This translates into a really hardcore dev shop (we have a lot of talent up here).*

If you're interested, shoot me a message on here, and I'll give you my work email address to send your resume to, and we'll go from there.

(Location-wise, we're roughly at Prospect and Sharp Point, about 5-7 mins east of campus)

We're on our unit of the Middle Ages and one of the main concepts of Middle England was chivalry. We discussed what chivalry meant and what it meant in Middle England, and how it's evolved into something different today. Then I wanted them to write a short narrative about a time that they conducted an act of chivalry upon someone, or when someone conducted an act of chivalry upon them. 

After some time had passed I asked if anyone wanted to share. A few people did, and it was all just the expected boyfriends ""Holding the door open, paying for dinner, taking the coats"" for their girlfriends, or girlfriends reflecting on moments when their boyfriends did that for them. Stuff like that. Then this one girl raised her hand and shared that she and her girlfriend went to a park one day, and it was muddy, and because her girlfriend didn't like mud, she carried her across the mud so that her girlfriend wouldn't get dirty.

I work for a Big corporation, a telecom giant (fortune 50) as an Electrical Engineer as a contractor. I was once an intern to this corporation for 1 yr when I was still doing Grad school (my MS), and I later quit my job to finish school. I am now back as a contract engineer to one of the 10000+ engineering teams. I program for this team. I do mostly scripting. I write mostly in C, Perl and Python. I have close to 3 yrs experience now. I am the only programmer in this team. I program for test automation mostly in Perl and Python.

Recently my manager has indicated that he would like to hire me as a staff engineer to the team from the contracting company. I am pretty sure that I will get a call from the HR any time, and I would like to be prepared.

When I graduated from grad school 2 yrs ago during a tough economy it took a while to find a job and when I got this contractor offer, I took it as a foot in the door. Naturally, my compensation is very less compared to the other engineers in this company whom I work with. I am offered 68k a yr. No more, no less. No matter how long or hard I work (I put 65+hrs/wk). I have been a contractor for ~5 months now.

This corporation went to extra-ordinary lengths to first source me, interview me, and then put me on another third party company's payroll and then hire me as a contractor. The other company from whom I receive my paychecks from, hardly have ever seen me, or even met me. I don't get half the benefits what the employees of the company I work for get, but I am required to work twice as hard, and I am always expected to exceed the expectations in hopes that I get hired as a staff.

How should I proceed? They do offer healthcare, complete medical insurance, a sign-on bonus, stock options etc. But I would like to know specifically when in comes to paycheck, how much should I ask for my remuneration per hour? when they offer me. (I already know they undervalue everyone). By now, you'd think this is a shitty company to work for, though it is, the science and research I am presently doing, is not done anywhere else, and as far as compared to what I learn, get to do, this is the best place I can be.

Sorry for the long explanation, though I felt I should explain completely. Thanks!"

qhikz,0,2012-03-04,"Kerry Egan talks about God, from CNN.",BWSmith,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/qhikz/kerry_egan_talks_about_god_from_cnn/,"By Kerry Egan, Special to CNN

As a divinity school student, I had just started working as a student chaplain at a cancer hospital when my professor asked me about my work.  I was 26 years old and still learning what a chaplain did.

""I talk to the patients,"" I told him.

""You talk to patients?  And tell me, what do people who are sick and dying talk to the student chaplain about?"" he asked.

I had never considered the question before.  “Well,” I responded slowly, “Mostly we talk about their families.”

“Do you talk about God?

“Umm, not usually.”

“Or their religion?”

“Not so much.”

“The meaning of their lives?”

“Sometimes.”

“And prayer?  Do you lead them in prayer?  Or ritual?”

“Well,” I hesitated.  “Sometimes.  But not usually, not really.”

I felt derision creeping into the professor's voice.  “So you just visit people and talk about their families?”

“Well, they talk.  I mostly listen.”

“Huh.”  He leaned back in his chair.

A week later, in the middle of a lecture in this professor's packed class, he started to tell a story about a student he once met who was a chaplain intern at a hospital.

“And I asked her, 'What exactly do you do as a chaplain?'  And she replied, 'Well, I talk to people about their families.'” He paused for effect. “And that was this student's understanding of  faith!  That was as deep as this person's spiritual life went!  Talking about other people's families!”

The students laughed at the shallowness of the silly student.  The professor was on a roll.

“And I thought to myself,” he continued, “that if I was ever sick in the hospital, if I was ever dying, that the last person I would ever want to see is some Harvard Divinity School student chaplain wanting to talk to me about my family.”

My body went numb with shame.  At the time I thought that maybe, if I was a better chaplain, I would know how to talk to people about big spiritual questions.  Maybe if dying people met with a good, experienced chaplain they would talk about God, I thought.

Today, 13 years later, I am a hospice chaplain.  I visit people who are dying – in their homes, in hospitals, in nursing homes.   And if you were to ask me the same question - What do people who are sick and dying talk about with the chaplain?  – I, without hesitation or uncertainty, would give you the same answer. Mostly, they talk about their families: about their mothers and fathers, their sons and daughters.

They talk about the love they felt, and the love they gave.  Often they talk about love they did not receive, or the love they did not know how to offer, the love they withheld, or maybe never felt for the ones they should have loved unconditionally.

They talk about how they learned what love is, and what it is not.    And sometimes, when they are actively dying, fluid gurgling in their throats, they reach their hands out to things I cannot see and they call out to their parents:  Mama, Daddy, Mother.

What I did not understand when I was a student then, and what I would explain to that professor now, is that people talk to the chaplain about their families because that is how we talk about God.  That is how we talk about the meaning of our lives.  That is how we talk about the big spiritual questions of human existence.

We don't live our lives in our heads, in theology and theories.  We live our lives in our families:  the families we are born into, the families we create, the families we make through the people we choose as friends.

This is where we create our lives, this is where we find meaning, this is where our purpose becomes clear.

Family is where we first experience love and where we first give it.  It's probably the first place we've been hurt by someone we love, and hopefully the place we learn that love can overcome even the most painful rejection.

This crucible of love is where we start to ask those big spiritual questions, and ultimately where they end.

I have seen such expressions of love:  A husband gently washing his wife's face with a cool washcloth, cupping the back of her bald head in his hand to get to the nape of her neck, because she is too weak to lift it from the pillow. A daughter spooning pudding into the mouth of her mother, a woman who has not recognized her for years.

A wife arranging the pillow under the head of her husband's no-longer-breathing body as she helps the undertaker lift him onto the waiting stretcher.

We don't learn the meaning of our lives by discussing it.  It's not to be found in books or lecture halls or even churches or synagogues or mosques.  It's discovered through these actions of love.

If God is love, and we believe that to be true, then we learn about God when we learn about love. The first, and usually the last, classroom of love is the family.

Sometimes that love is not only imperfect, it seems to be missing entirely.  Monstrous things can happen in families.  Too often, more often than I want to believe possible, patients tell me what it feels like when the person you love beats you or rapes you.  They tell me what it feels like to know that you are utterly unwanted by your parents.  They tell me what it feels like to be the target of someone's rage.   They tell me what it feels like to know that you abandoned your children, or that your drinking destroyed your family, or that you failed to care for those who needed you.

Even in these cases, I am amazed at the strength of the human soul.  People who did not know love in their families know that they should have been loved.  They somehow know what was missing, and what they deserved as children and adults.

When the love is imperfect, or a family is destructive, something else can be learned:  forgiveness.  The spiritual work of being human is learning how to love and how to forgive.

We don’t have to use words of theology to talk about God; people who are close to death almost never do. We should learn from those who are dying that the best way to teach our children about God is by loving each other wholly and forgiving each other fully - just as each of us longs to be loved and forgiven by our mothers and fathers, sons and daughters.

I can do the work that is necessary and when I find sufficient motivation to try I do very well but frankly, I hate it. I'd rather get a root canal than study for another midterm (which I have three of in the next two weeks). 

It isn't (realistically) possible to get a related job for a while and see how I like it, there aren't enough jobs in my stupid country to go around. I've applied to dozens of internship positions which I should hear back from soon but, I am far from hopeful as they receive hundreds of applicants. 

The government doesn't care that youth unemployment is the highest its been in decades so I can't imagine any kind of influx in the area in the near future. The Co-op program at my university found jobs for ~5% of its members.

Thanks for all your support and servers all over the years. How could I forget?
[I am a machinima maker and have started a new comedy troupe that is planning to use NS2 as the main engine in one of our new series. I remember reading that the NS2 edit tools include a lot of things geared specifically towards movie-making. Is this still true and if so what can you tell me about it? Will you be able to import custom models and textures?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgquo?context=5)|Please do this! But don't do it yet. We still have a bit of work to do with our tools. Our original Onos teaser was all done with our tools but we need to do more with them to make them fun and easy to use. That said, all the tools are in the main game's directory, you can play around now. You can import your own custom art now. Here's a tutorial: http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns2/2011/7/ns2_custom_model_importing_guide.
[What exactly was the BUS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhxl3?context=5)|Oh, you bitch. ;)  I'm sorry, I am forbidden for ever talking about this. One day you will see something like it from us, but I doubt we'll ever tell you ""THAT was the BUS"".  Sorry I can't give you more.
[Did you ever feel worried that having an OPEN(ish) beta so early in the development process for NS2 would negatively impact how the game is received? Has the feedback you've received been helpful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgmyj?context=5)|Nope. We want to make sure we're making a sequel that is faithful to the original. We've made some bad decisions that we've reversed since even before the beta (we started getting feedback in 2009) and I'm SO glad.
[You distribute NS2 via Steam but don't sell the game on Steam. Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgl5o?context=5)|We will - come summer. The game isn't ready for the mega audience of Steam. But we want our community to play the game now and give us feedback while we still have time to make (sometimes big) changes.
[In the same vein, considering CS, TFC and DOD are all fully-owned and controlled Valve IP that leaves NS1 as one of the biggest non-valve HL1 mods. Has Valve ever gone to you with a buyout/employment offer? Can you give a quick history of your personal/professional relationship with Valve?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgl5o?context=5)|Valve has always been very supportive of us, and continues to be, but has never given us an offer like that.
[As a follow up would you take it now that you've built your own engine?  Would you have taken it before you started to build your own engine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkfd0?context=5)|Hmmm. I actually don't think we'd take it either way, unless a) it was an amazing deal and b) we could continue to operate totally independently.  But it was a pretty big sacrifice to do things our own way (in terms of salary, stress and time taken). For most people/projects I would recommend getting support like this if you can. If I ever start a new company, I would be less concerned with independence and control and more interested in moving quickly.
[How do you feel about how far back the release date has been pushed since the original trailer for NS2 was released? What is the current projected release date for NS2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgk81?context=5)|There are many embarrassing factors involved with not making our original date, but we're going to make this one. - We don't have an exact release date but it will be this summer for sure.
[Piggybacking on that last question/answer, what programming language or ecosystem is the easiest to get into as a new developer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xigsz?context=5)|Not a simple question to answer. I'd probably recommend Javascript right now: it's very similar to Lua and here in the Bay Area, you can get a very high-paying great job doing web programming if you aren't able to make the transition into games right away.
[What are the current plans for supporting Natural Selection 2 after its release? Should we expect paid DLC? Or smaller free updates like Team Fortress 2 (and building off of this question, when can I expect hats for my gorge)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgzmq?context=5)|We want to ""unite the world through play"". If people have to pay for updates, then suddenly our community splits and people aren't all playing the same game.  So I expect we'll be releasing tons of patches, maps, new weapons, etc. for years, and all for free. We may add a fireman's hat for the Gorge, but you shouldn't have to pay for it. :)
[How did you come up with the names for the Alien 'classes'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgqg7?context=5)|I wanted short names that reflected how the marines might refer to the aliens when they saw them. That also meant that the words were easy to remember. ""Skulk"", ""Gorge"", ""Lerk"", ""Fade"" and yes, even ""Onos"" were all words that roughnecks might use to crudely refer to these slimy creatures.
[What do you mean by not calling yourselves indie? How do you classify UnknownWorlds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj6zb?context=5)|Hard to say. The whole ""indie"" title is so ridiculous. Devs want to call themselves indie because it seems cool and artsy, but no one seems to know what it really means.  We aren't making a niche game with 8-bit aesthetics that is a personal tale of suffering about the designer's life. But we ARE making a game on our own terms, the way we want to make it.   I don't know if that's ""indie"" or not, but I don't really care. We're making the game we want to make. We hope you love every second of it.
[Have you had much adoption of your in-house engine for mods and other independent projects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgkeb?context=5)|Lots of people have been working on mods for NS2. We get regular performance improvements, bug fixes, new alien roles, movement tweaks and so much more from the community. They literally send us the code. We've hired through our community heavily.
[I would like to know how you see the NS2 community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xh1q4?context=5)|Yes there are days we hate everyone.
[I just have to imagine some days after a patch with a rough spot you might just hate everyone. But overall do you and the other developers like to see the heavily opinionated community watching over the whole process, does it pressure you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xh1q4?context=5)|I'm more used to the negativity then some of the other members of the team so I have pretty thick skin. You just have to remember that people usually complain because they care. They care about your game and they don't want to see you mess it up so they react. Harshly.
[What other Sci-Fi games and/or films have inspired Natural Selection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgltf?context=5)|The usual suspects: Aliens. Gloom. Starcraft. Planetside. Blade Runner. Minority Report. Counter-strike. eXistenZ.
[Any thoughts on some spacious, partially-outdoor maps with vegetation?  How would this sort of thing work visually (with the art assets you currently have) and how do you feel it would affect the game mechanics to try this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhw1j?context=5)|Sounds awesome. We would love this, but right now we are focusing on nailing the indoor environments. That's hard enough, especially for a team of our size and resources. If we can pull off indoor environments, there's a really good chance we'll expand them beyond that.
[What do you look for specifically when hiring programmers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgmbh?context=5)|Great communication skills. Great programming skills. Not over engineering things. Passionate about our game. Fun to work with. Knows who we are already and what we do (great cover letter).  We are hiring programmers by the way! http://www.unknownworlds.com/jobs.
[Charlie, I notice that the great emphasis on the cover letter is not just mentioned here on Reddit but on the jobs site itself as well as even the programming test document where it is said to be ""very important!"" I am a college freshman in CS with experience writing a minimal amount cover letters for internships and advice given to me over the months has been varied in regards to what is actually expected of it. Would you be able to give some insight into some potential content a great cover letter would cover from your unique perspective as a programmer (i.e. how do we demonstrate knowledge of the company, should we reiterate parts of the resume or not, talk about side projects/plug our Github, etc.)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xi7n4?context=5)|It's kind of like giving a wedding toast: it's hard to give advice on how to do it, but it's completely clear to everyone on the receiving end when you're got a good one or not. The only criteria is that it comes from the heart. If you actually care about our company and game, let it through. If it, it doesn't matter what you say or how you say it.
[As an employer, what are 3 things that you specifically look for when a veteran 3D artist, yet inexperienced in the gaming industry, sends in a resume and art portfolio?  Do they have any chance at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgkyd?context=5)|Cover letter is extremely important: we want to see that they candidate knows who we are and is passionate about what we're doing.  A hot portfolio is very helpful (keep it simple and loading fast, we have ADD). Being versatile in your skills also helps a lot, as we sometimes have to move people around.
[Hey, how big was the spike in sales after NS2 was frontpaged not too long ago?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhtsl?context=5)|We had the biggest day of pre-sales today in at least the past 6 months. It's been really nice!
[When is heavy armor coming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhtsl?context=5)|Exosuit is being worked on as we speak. It's coming.
[NS1 had a decently popular professional gaming scene. What do you think about e-Sports today? Are you willing to support and encourage the development of it in regards to NS2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhbei?context=5)|We are quite committed to it. I watch scrims whenever I can (thanks NS2HD!) and I love it. It's amazing to see what very skilled, very focused teams can do. It's always a rush. I actually can't think of much I'd RATHER do than watch two amazing teams struggle for dominance.  It's hard to get a handle on e-sports today, but I do watch a lot of competitive Starcraft 2 and that's a great model. I'm hoping the scene is ready for something new.
[I loved NS1 specifically because of the asymmetry between the two sides not just in weapons/abilities but in how the teams were managed.  The marines were highly organized but relied on their commander, while the aliens had a more individual approach but everybody could do their thing without being managed by a commander.  So I am wondering why you guys decided to add an alien commander in NS2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xi95n?context=5)|I get this question a lot. It's to unify the resource model.  Not having an alien commander in NS1 made the resource model asymmetric which was a big problem for balance. The game could be balanced for small teams or large teams, but didn't ""scale"" for all player sizes. I ended up balancing it for 6 vs. 6 but for NS2 I wanted to fix this problem. That mean unifying the resource model and adding an alien commander.  However, keep in mind that the two roles are going to be totally different, so we're still committed to ""Two Unique Sides"". Just like Starcraft where Zerg plays very different than Terran, but I would say our differences could be even bigger. The alien commander is by far the least finished part of the game right now.
[Do you guys ever get overwhelmed by the feedback on the forums? I know sometimes it can be overly negative or critical. How much actual game balancing takes place from online feedback vs. playtesting/simulations? (and how many playtesters do you guys use?)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xiacv?context=5)|Yes we do get overwhelmed, to the point where sometimes we can't look or have to take a break for awhile. I'm pretty good with not letting negative people get to me though.  Balancing is done using a combination of feedback from our internal play testers (I think we have about 30 who play the game almost every day), our development team (we all play the game almost every day) and our wider beta community (31k players). We also have extensive game stats that we've been collecting and we're adding to that almost every patch.
[How many official maps / Environmental texture sets do you currently plan on releasing post-launch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xi3sd?context=5)|We are starting on a new map/environment art set now. I imagine we'll add a few new sets, at minimum. We would love to see some new looks!
[Is NS2 going to be localized, or will it only be available in English?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj06r?context=5)|I really really want to give our community free reign over localizations. The plan is to allow people to translate the game through a web form (add a new language, start translating) and then people could vote up or down the translations (to get rid of jokes and briefing).
[Just thought I'd say 'kudos' for Mod Support, custom maps and gamemodes were what kept me playing the original NS for as long as I did. I was wondering: Have you thought about adding a 'survival' mode? Single-life marines lasting for as long as they can against a single alien infestor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkcga?context=5)|I think ""survival"" mode would be awesome. You know what? One could make this as an NS2 mod with about 300 lines of Lua script. The most work would be creating a new alien model, but you could use a scaled/tweaked Fade or Onos for now.
[Could you maybe help me understand why NS2 is awesome in ~two sentences?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xih4e?context=5)|An immersive video game like NS2 is the best way to experience these things - more powerful than books, more fantastic than paintball, more personal than film.
[Charlie, how long are you going to use that picture?  Its been around forever!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhm69?context=5)|Busted. Sorry I need some new pics.
[If you were to hypothetically make a sandwich in the next hour, in a kitchen full of everything you need to do it, what would you put on your sandwich?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj06n?context=5)|Oooh, so hungry.  Crusty toasted focaccia. Avocado. Mozzarella. Roasted red peppers. Arugula. Just a sprinkle of the finest olive oil and the best salt you've ever had.
[I actually thought it was really fun. It was very team oriented, and there was more communication than in games like CoD or Battlefield. I haven't tried out Natural Selection yet (I have a massive backlog of games on Steam), but it looks great.   What kind of games do you play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkt3y?context=5)|I play a lot of Euro board games, as well as more artsy/unique video games. My favorite video games of recent memory: Braid, Limbo (perfection), Portal and...Mortal Kombat 9.
[Charlie, you do some amazing work with the community, you keep us all well informed of whats going on, my question is how do you cope?  what energy drink fuels Charlie Clevelend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhhms?context=5)|Black tea and lattes. Sightglass or Vega preferred. Our office is in the land of amazing, snobby coffee.
[I've been a huge fan of ns since way back. I've always wanted to play it single player. Now when beta is starting to look and feel real good to play I'm even more interested in the idea. Perhaps something to dabble in after the game is released? I mean... Just look at it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhdk0?context=5)|I've had an idea for a story for awhile, but I don't see us doing SP any time soon. Budgets have gotten completely out of control in this area (Uncharted 3 anyone?) and I don't want to figure out how to spend 30 million dollars creating cut-scenes.  I think our company will always be about multiplayer. It just makes so much more sense to make a game that people play forever instead of once, and I'm much more interested in people-oriented games than story-oriented games.
[You've been committed to NS for a long time now. How did you decide to start, and did you ever imagine you'd still be at it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhtw9?context=5)|Heh. No, if I realized how much time I would on this game I'm not sure I would've gone down this path. It's become a lifestyle.  I started because I got fired from my last job and I had saved up some money. I had this idea of a game burning in my brain and was amazed to see how big the mod scene had gotten. Making it a HL mod seemed like the right approach to bring this game to the world so I just started.   http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014394/1-Hour-Video-Game.
[I bought your game twice via various deals (one was humble bundle, the other something else). I'm on Ubuntu though, and while there certainly won't be a native version, will any effort be put into any potential incompatibilities with Wine/Crossover Games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgs1y?context=5)|Probably not. We're a tiny team and we barely have enough resources to get the game done. I don't think it makes sense for us to work on the a linux client or Wine support.  However, I bet our community can and will do this.
[That woul require some access to the source code. The renderer has to be rewritten to opengl, and probably some file access/threading changes. Totaly doable, but not only with the lua code. In an older newspost that possibility was mentioned and seemed like the way forward for a potential linux port. Is this still the case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkjcc?context=5)|Hey Asraniel, good to see you outside of our forums.  Sorry, I was talking about the Wine support. I don't know much about it, but I know our players got NS1 working in Wine, I bet they could do for NS2 also.
[What will you do after the game is released and you can take some time off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgw7n?context=5)|I plan on bicycling across Italy. It's something I've wanted to do for a very long time.  Then it's back to work.

I think that was just luck and timing. Or maybe it's just that most people don't ask?
[Do you have any other projects in mind for the Spark engine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgvy8?context=5)|Yes, quite a few. Some very different genres too. Some pretty experimental ideas too.
[Hey Charlie! I started playing NS in early 2003. I've had my times off but I always come back to it. Just wanted you to know that you and your mod (and now game) have given me many many hours of enjoyable videogame moments. So here's the question, how comfortable do you guys feel with the release date for Ns2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xguoa?context=5)|We're committed to it. If the game has serious flaws that we think we need more time to address, we'll fix them instead of releasing something bad, but I'm think we're going to hit it.
[I'd love to hear more about your involvement with MindRover. Sadly it's no longer available for purchase, but it succeeded in getting really good reviews at places like IGN upon release. Do you think it would be more successful if released now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xl5it?context=5)|Wow, you played MindRover?! That was the first commercial game I worked on. It was just a couple a people - I worked my butt off on that game. It was a complete blast too.
[Any ideas on what happened to the rights? Could we see a re-release on GOG or even an open sourcing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xl5it?context=5)|Kent still owns the rights to MindRover as far as I know. You can contact him if you Google Kent Quirk.
[Are you planning to make anything after NS2? :)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xlsdi?context=5)|Oh yeah.  We're just getting started. Lots of ideas, some very different. It's my hope that as we grow we'll be able to do more projects and do them a bit faster too. It would be amazing to release a game every 6 months or year.
[Why is your Spark engine so sexy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xka8v?context=5)|That's a question for Max: http://www.unknownworlds.com/about.

[Still, fucking awesome game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xlbz7?context=5)|Just think about all the work you DIDN'T have to do to play this game...
[Of course =(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj1bx?context=5)|I don't see us adding a third race any time soon. What I really love about the game is the Marines vs. Aliens feel. We all know what that's like from various sci-fi books and movies, and as soon as you add a third race it totally changes that.

I'm fairly sure I have depression, though too stubborn/proud to ever seek any kind of therapy for it. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 12 but my parents basically said fuck you to the doctor we don't believe in magic pills. 

So I've been with this girl for almost 6 months now and she's a really sweet girls, albeit a bit innocent, with a bangin body and beautiful eyes. My life is kind of in disarray right now. She seems like the only good thing I have going for me right now. There's this weird feeling that I cant describe when I think of us breaking up. I wouldn't mourn or suffer from any heartbreak whatsoever if we broke up, but I would definitely become more depressed because I wouldn't have that one good part about my day. Some of you might say, ""that's your hearbreak"" but no I swear this is different. On the surface I'm the most convincing lovey-dovey boyfriend and I know 100% she has no idea that I feel pretty hollow. 

I'm having a lot of trouble coping with the workload of studying engineering. I also extremely procrastinate, to the point where I finish work maybe an hour before its due, sometimes even minutes. I ""dislike"" my life in college because it seems the only thing I do is go to class, do homework, see my gf, and sleep. I want to do other stuff, but think I don't have the time. I do, just extreme procrastination leaves me with none. I'm not even doing anything fun when I procrastinate, I just waste time. On top of that I'm constantly drained and exhausted to the point where I can sleep the entire day. My appetite is pretty low too.

I'm getting fairly crap grades, I have a 2.9 right now, which gives me a ton of anxiety because I need a 3.0 to go study abroad and for internships over the summer. 

Last year I was single and went out to party every Friday/Saturday and would hook up with tons of chicks. This year I've barely gone to parties at all, because honestly I don't know what to do besides picking-up girls.  While seeing my girlfriend is the highlight of my day, and we have a lot of fun in the sack, we don't really do much besides cuddle and fuck because I'm so TIRED. I just don't feel like I have any energy to do anything anymore. Freshman year I at least went to the gym and got pretty toned which made me feel good about myself and increased my appetite somewhat, I haven't gone at all this year due to time constraints. 

Looking at me from the outside in, I don't have any real problems. My parents are fairly wealthy, and I can spend as much money as I need and don't need to work. I own a nicer car than any 20 year old should be allowed to own. My family is very supportive and close, and I look set to live a fairly comfortable lifestyle. I'm fairly attractive and naturally thin and don't have many issues attracting girls. I don't have any REAL problems, yet I feel like I'm in a marathon and I'm the last man in the pack desperately trying to keep up. 

IDK what the fuck is wrong with me, but I can't keep living like this. How can I fix this? 

I'm scared of being prescribed meds and becoming dependent on them to be happy, or have them completely change my personality. I'm scared of people who are close to me finding out that I have these issues despite my outward ""perfect life."" I'm scared of my parent's reactions. I'm scared of whatever ""this"" is turning me into a fuckup.

Hamer I am a recently laid off designer (*unlicensed architect*), looking to pick up some side work.  

I can provide: 

* Residential designs &amp; floor plans (new construction, additions &amp; renovations)
* Custom millwork &amp; furniture design
* Real estate &amp; architectural marketing &amp; graphic designs
* Renderings; Hand, digital &amp; 3D modeling  
* Documentation &amp; historic research of buildings
* Photo manipulation


I have been employed locally at state award winning architecture and interiors firm for the previous four years, where I performed traditional roles; such as intern architect, designer and project manager. My experiences have allowed me to work on over thirty successful residential projects within the city of Austin (*additions, renovations &amp; new construction*). Also a commercial portfolio that includes a downtown Austin yoga studio, contemporary office space, and served as project lead on a multi-million dollar venture to design an Austin church's youth and office facilities.

I am looking to continue to build my portfolio with thoughtful, beautiful, honest and timeless design. With an understanding of the residential design process from start to finish, I will seek solutions that respond to both the regional and environmental contexts of the site. I have an eye for detail, with a sophisticated understanding of materials from the outside to the inside. Comments and questions are welcome, PM if you have a project you wish to discuss.

qgvby,3,2012-03-04,Looking for an internship in the Atlanta area. (x-post from r/filmmakers),gsufilmstudent,AtlFilmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlFilmmakers/comments/qgvby/looking_for_an_internship_in_the_atlanta_area/,"So, I'm a film student at GSU in Atlanta who's in the process of looking  for a summer internship. This probably sounds cliche, but, my ultimate goal is to become a DP. However, I'd be happy doing anything in the camera department.

I know it's a tough department to get into, so I was wondering if anybody had some advice for finding an internship that is related to my career goal. What I mean by that is, I really don't want to intern in an office where I'm getting people coffee and answering phone calls (however, I'm not above getting people coffee, taking lunch orders, etc. - as long as it's on set and near a camera).

For those of you in camera, how did you get to where you are? What steps did you take starting out in order to get into the camera department?
I realize not everybody goes the film school route, but I'd like to hear people's experiences from both sides.

Also, if anybody in the Atlanta area is looking for a good intern, I'm your guy. I'm a hard-worker - I'll do whatever it takes to get the job done - and I'm highly-motivated. I'm a quick learner and a good listener (in other words, I know how to keep quiet and do what I'm told). Also, I've got PA experience working on music videos and commercials, as well as experience working as a camera intern on a  couple of music video that were shot on an ARRI Alexa, so I've got a basic understanding of how the camera department works.

Any thoughts, suggestions, or experiences would be appreciated."

So I've been in dallas for...well about 7 weeks now and my roommates and I are having quite a bit of trouble meeting people.  Two of us are 21 and one of us is 27 and we're having a difficult time making friends.  We live in the Irving area, but head have been heading to downtown Dallas on the weekends in search of nightlife.  We've visited The Lizard Lounge, though that was rather expensive and resulted in meeting no one.  Same goes for many of the bars on McKinney ave.

To be fair, we're generally rather shy (we're all engineers here on an internship from Georgia, North Carolina and I'm from Florida).

Please feel free to provide any input/ideas you can think of!  Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated :)

I am saddened to report that late Saturday/early Sunday morning around 2:40 a.m., Ernest Andrew Martinez fell to his death in a tragic accident in the Pangea Parking Structure.  This was unquestionably an accidental death.  Ernest was not enrolled this quarter, but was registered for the Spring.  He posted on his Facebook page how excited he was to be returning to UCSD.  He lived with close friends in an apartment off campus but spent most of his time working as an Intern at Duocomm in Victorville, CA and then returning to San Diego to be with his friends and housemates on the weekends.  Ernest was a member of Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity and of Frequency, a student-run UCSD a cappella group.

I feel as if it is a fairly reasonable goal. It would mean losing about 40 pounds. Do you think this is practical? I have been trying a number of things. I started out on a calorie restricted diet and that wasn't really working (even paired with daily exercise) and then I tried keto for a while. The keto went great for a little while but I have my suspicions that it was mostly because I was starving myself because all the food I had at the time had too many carbs. I can't keep up with keto however because it just wasn't practical for my current lifestyle. So now I'm going to try a strict calorie with lower carb type diet. What do you think about this? I could really use some more advice. 

Also are there any little pointers any of you may have? I have a really hard time losing weight. I'm a pretty active person. I was working out every day of the week last semester and only lost about five pounds. I'm going to get my thyroid retested when I get home from my current internship. Is there perhaps another reason I'm not losing weight? Is there anything else that I should ask my doctor about? Thanks guys. I know this is something we hear all the time but I'm really serious about this. it just gets so frustrating to see other people I know losing weight doing the same things that I am and I'm just staying the same.

 I've (19F) have been with my boyfriend (21M) for about 3 1/2 years now. He recently had an internship offer about 6 hours away from where we both go to school. Since he left in January we have been doing great, not much fighting and communication is pretty strong between us. We have been visiting each other about every 2-3 weekends also. 

We have discussed how I feel about porn many times and he knows that I don't like him watching it. He has assured me multiple times throughout this transition that he has not been looking at porn in any way. 

I'm here to visit and am using his computer. Today I found 60+ links to porn videos, amateur albums etc. I am very upset and am not sure what to do. We have never had problems like this and I don't understand what lying to me was supposed to help.

Should I just forgive him and let him watch/look at these things or should I stand my ground and tell him I don't want him too...

TLDR; Found amateur porn on BF's computer while visiting from out of town. Had mutual agreement to not watch/look at porn while temporarily long distance. "

What type of visa will I need?  I've been to Japan in the past for summer language programs and the tourist visa worked.  However, since I'll be getting paid, I'm guessing that the 90-day tourist visa won't be sufficient, correct? 

I'm sure my employer will give me the details soon (I just accepted the offer today), but I was kind of hoping I could use a tourist visa since I may want to get a JR pass and do some traveling.  Any ideas? I was thinking I could always just leave for Taiwan or Korea for a weekend and come back using a tourist visa and use the JR pass.  Any thoughts?

**Edit:** Sorry, part of the reason I asked is because if I do leave to Taiwan and re-enter Japan, are people in customs going to be weird about me trying to enter with a tourist visa?"

i have to take one of the two physics sequences (0110/0111 or 0174/175), and i was curious as to how difficult the 0174 sequence is. i did fine in calc 1 a couple semesters ago but haven't taken a mathematics-based course since then.

while i'm not the best at math, i really enjoy it and would love to excel, but since i have other major responsibilities this summer, i don't want to get involved in something i can't dedicate the required amount of time to.

i am planning on taking either of these sequences totally in the upcoming summer (6w1/6w2) along with a couple other courses and an internship.

advice, comments, concerns?

thanks!"

I graduated from a SUNY (State University of New York) school and it is not considered a ""top tier business"" school.  I fucked my GPA up one semester and ended with an overall 3.1 (3.3 in both business and economics).  I also was a pitcher on the varsity (not club) baseball team.  We are a division 1 school and the schedule was very demanding, practices, games, traveling, study sessions, training, summer leagues, etc.  

I did not have the time to intern in the summer during college while playing baseball and working side jobs.  After college I got an internship at an emerging market hedge fund.  They were a relatively small shop (currently $150 AUM) and concentrated mostly on emerging market equities.  While there I got exposure to just about every aspect involved, trading, operations, and analysis/data mining/modeling.  

I'm trying to get an entry level job and get my foot in the door somewhere.  What job titles should I be looking for/ how the hell can I stand out or get an interview over other candidates from top-tier schools.  Any other suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

I'm extremely pissed and filled with regret because I had offers to multiple Ivy league schools, but I had a full scholarship to the school I chose and didn't want the burden of being $150,000+ in debt leaving college."

People who grew up not afraid to give Batman the additional powers of Spider-Man or any of the X-Men in their coloring books. People who don't ask for permission, but just do what they think is best.

Over the last year though I've failed at finding such people for my functionally complete, currently live site. 

I've done my best to recruit a team who could be passionate about what they were doing and make it their own. Nonetheless, those that have been recruited and stayed on for some time always seem to do only what is asked, not really getting excited about what they are doing. Personally I always had the opposite problem when working as an intern and professionally in startups and fully mature organizations.

I feel like [Pewlpit](http://pewlpit.com) has become a solid, pretty remarkable product, but am wondering if I can make it into what it needs to be on my own… At times I wish I had sought out a partner earlier in the process, so then maybe they could feel more involved and a part of experience.

Do you think I've been wrong in seeking out people who don't have the technical skills (I know I wasn't in my first positions) believing that them growing with the product would inspire feelings of ownership and passion?

I know this isn't a very focused, and somewhat of a rant, but any feedback would be much appreciated."

I've looked everywhere for a programming internship or an infrastructure internship, but I can't find anything nearby. If I get the offer for helpdesk, should I take it? Or should I stick with my ""internship""? They want me to work full time this summer. I think I'd kill myself.

For a number of years I was very close friends to a guy and a girl who are a couple together and had a son (The female is sick it's not terminal but it is pretty serious and they have no idea what is going on). I regarded them as my family and did everything in my power to help then whenever they had problems. On one occassion she called me up crying cause they had a huge fight in which I was going to get sucked up in at 04:00 AM and I instantly got in my car and drove over) however there was about a 150km distance between us. So I visisted them alot and then stayed for a few days during that period. Keep in mind at that moment I had no job no school and no source of obligations.

That lasted for about 6 months during the time my depression got less and started doing some freelance work for an old internship for some small payment just to keep busy since the owners of that company were worried about me.

About a month later (this was about July) I met my current girlfriend and felt my life was going in an upward stream. All was well untill I landed in October with an chance to get a contract. It was a freelance job for 3 months (till January) so I made clear to everyone that this was very important for me and that I wanted this job so that was my number one priority at the moment.

During the course of those 3 months we spoke less and less resulting in her questioning our friendship. I tried to make clear that with this contract and my new girlfriend (We just got serious during that period) that I didn't have alot of sparetime however that I still cared about them deeply and that I would surely visit them later when things had calmed down. So we had like 4-5 of these conversations during the course of November. Then we had another one in which I lost my temper a little bit and said that I felt she was claiming me. At that moment she got mad at me and said she never wanted to see me again and logged off and distanced herself from me. I didn't like her reaction and was very sad and upset about it. However in my view it was her choice and I had to respect it if I liked it or not. So about a month went by and I had kept her in my phone on MSN and on FB so she could contact me if she wanted to. But she didn't.

So after 4-5 weeks I give up and remove her from MSN and FB assuming our friendship was over. So about 2-3 weeks later her boyfriend hits me up asking me if I removed her from MSN and FB so I reply in all honesty that I did she he questions me why I did it. I told him it was because she said she never wanted to speak to me or see me again. He then replies why I didn't try to contact her. At this moment I was baffled cause I could not believe he just said that or that that was my responsibility because she was that one that distanced herself from me and all I cared about was just get an apology from her for saying she never wanted to see me again. We argued for a few hours untill we realised we couldn't solve this so he removed me and we lost all contact.

During February my girlfriend and I moved in together. We hadn't planned on it but it was the right move cause we would both be alot closer to our jobs since my contract got extended. I celebrated my birthday went on a snowboarding holiday without ever hearing from them.
One saturday afternoon my phone starts ringing and it is her calling me. So I pick up and she instantly starts crying that her father got diagnosed with terminal cancer. I have no idea how to react to it so I just talk back that I am sorry for her but that I can't do anything for her and I make sure I don't react to attached so after a few minutes she hangs up and again I hear nothing on them. Then last weekend I get another message from her boyfriend on FB that still although what happened they still see me as a close friend and it hurts them that I haven't called them after her call yet still during all this they never even asked how I was doing so I just ignored it.

I am sorry for the bad grammar and since this is quite lengthy I wasn't able to include all details. I appreciate any response :).

qi9xp,2,2012-03-05,"TwoX, I need some advice on how to stick out this living situation for the next 2 months",Momprobs,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/qi9xp/twox_i_need_some_advice_on_how_to_stick_out_this/,"Hi all--apologies if this doesn't go here. I would really like some advice or just outside perspectives on my situation. Right now I'm partway through my last semester of college, doing an internship and working part time, and my living situation has basically detonated. I'm living with my parents, mom's an alcoholic with borderline personality disorder and my dad is an enabler. So I get home one day like a week and a half ago and my mom has been screaming at, threatening, and harassing and assaulting my dad all night, to the point where he gets a restraining order against her. This is only temporary of course, and she convinces him to drop the charges and comes back home. She feels like I wasn't sympathetic enough to her because I actually pointed out that assault is illegal and so it wasn't my dad's fault. We'd also been having arguments before then. So now she is doing everything in her power to make sure I can't get to school, can't get to work (I get rides from them usually), she turns the internet off when I'm here so I can't go on, though she knows I have papers to write and online classes to attend. Whenever she feels like, oftentimes several times a night, she comes into my room and screams at me, insults me, threatens me, etc. 

I don't make enough money from my job to move out right now. I have some money saved but it would be 2 months' rent at most, and I do not have a car, so I wouldn't be able to keep the job I have now or continue attending school. Also we're quite poor and I lent her a significant amount of my money for rent, and I don't think I'll get it back if I cut ties now. I really want to just finish up and graduate but it is so hard to keep up with my schoolwork under these circumstances. I only have a few months left, and it doesn't make sense to quit right now, but I'm barely managing. Does anyone have any thoughts? I already go to counseling (when I can make it down to the school)."
qi9fw,5,2012-03-05,"I feel like I've given up, but I know I shouldn't feel this way and keep going; life.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qi9fw/i_feel_like_ive_given_up_but_i_know_i_shouldnt/,"Finishing up my Junior year in college, 20 years old, currently no job but looking for a college credit internship for the summer. My ideas bounce around because I have no idea where this feeling is rooted and I'll just write as my brain thinks.

I've submitted like 10 resumes to different companies over the month of February and still haven't gotten a reply. I'm afraid I won't get any internships for the summer to get my college credit.

I think because of this, I feel like I'm pretty much hopeless for the future. I want a career as a community manager/ PR for a video game company, but since most of my classes are finances/econ theory related, I don't stand a chance in getting anything PR related (thats also where I sent my resume so I can get some kind of experience in PR/CM).

I come home, do some homework, do other things around the house, play some video games. But it's gotten repetitive, I want change, but have no idea where to start. I want to already be out there in the world-- all this homework rinse-wash repeat is getting boring. However I'm kind of stuck since I only have 1 year to go and my parents want me to finish.

..and since I don't have a job I have no money to go out or get the things I want on my own. Ok,  know your saying ""go get a job,"" but I don't want just the register ""you want fries with that?"" kind of job. No I already swore to myself I won't get stuck in those. I give props to those who work at the register and can deal with customers like that. I also don't spoil myself or rely on my parents for money to get me things. I do have some cash saved up-- but even then I don't spend it carelessly knowing I have nothing else.

I pretty much just have no direction and have no idea what I can or want to do anymore. I don't have the steps or means to get something going for myself...

Did I make sense at all? I thought since reddit is awesome in helping people, thought I might give it a shot..."
qi7ip,7,2012-03-05,I feel like my life is becoming lies,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/qi7ip/i_feel_like_my_life_is_becoming_lies/,"Backstory (it's relevant)
--
When I was growing up I was raised a very very conservative Christian.  I always did what was biblically correct even if it had dire consequences.  This lasted up until I was about 19, when I realized how much of fundamentalist Christianity hated homosexuality.  Immediately I looked for a biological reasoning for homosexuality, couldn't figure out why God would create a being only to sentence it to a life of committing sin, and started turning on my faith.  


When I was living abroad in Thailand I came to the sudden conclusion that I couldn't do Christianity anymore.  I couldn't believe it.  I had this intense washing over of my faith, I trembled for many days, threw up for a couple days on end, couldn't eat, cried incessantly, but eventually got over it.

Recently
--
Just before I graduated from college from a west coast public ivy with a liberal arts degree, I had a huge breakdown.  I didn't want to go to Grad school to spend more money, but I realized that my school prepared me very well to go to grad school but not at all well enough to get a job.  One of my friends that graduated and got a swanky job in New York gave me some advice on employment that I've regretted ever since.  ""Just lie on your resume."" He told me.  ""There are a lot of things they can't prove, and you should make up as convincing lies as you can."" He pointed me out to a place that was hiring for a career I honestly wasn't interested in at all, advised me to bullshit most of my resume. Although feeling overwhelmingly disgusted with myself... I did it. Got hired, and got a job.  I've been there a year now.

Now
--
I work for a bank outside of San Diego in social media.  It's both horrifying and amazing that I've transferred three times within the company requiring me to (3x, once an intern) resubmit my resume with work history that i've completely botched and they've caught nothing.  

I hate myself, but did it because I didn't know how else to put food on the table.  Recruiters have asked me a couple months in about the places that I've ""worked internationally"", but I just lie again. Say they went out of business.  It's been about 6 months since any questions have come up, and I'm pretty sure I'm golden. 

I feel horrible because someone else with relevant experience could've had that job.  Someone else who studied the field. Someone else who actually *wants to work in that industry.* I don't deserve anything that I've built for myself.  I studied Psychology because I wanted to help people... now I work in an industry that I get no satisfaction out of.  Whenever something comes up about my work, I lie about it.  I started lying to my friends about cancelling appointments.  I've lied to my friends and coworkers about petty things.  I've gotten no negative reinforcement, and come clean to one of my friends about my habits and they told me that I'm a fantastic liar. 

I don't know how to stop.  My life with stringent moral values was (Christian or otherwise) incredibly painful.  My life without them is filled with lies, I'm making progress, but I hate myself, and I hate my work.  It shows through the work that produce.

Part of me also believes that this is life - and this is just what it takes to be employed or get anywhere today.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How do you respond to people that think GMOs are like radioactive Nazis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlpos?context=5)|That unlike radioactive Nazis, there is no solid reproducible harm of GMO technology.  Scientists almost universally agree.  Plus, if any of us public scientists found harm in GMOs, we'd report it, and be set for life with grants, Nobel prizes and awesome papers that changed farming!
[Can you tell us about the light side of GMO science?  I feel that companies like Monsanto really give the field a bad name.  What are some things that will be of *benefit* to our species on the horizon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlp24?context=5)|This is a tricky question. First the science.  From model plants we have learned about the pathways that help provide tolerance to extreme weather, drought, etc.  We know how plants make metabolites and resist disease.  All of these could be parts of the new generation of transgenic plants.  More flavor, nutrition, etc too.  However, it is almost impossible to commercialize these materials.  The approval process selects for big companies, and that's why the only transgenic crops are big ag crops!   In the long run, safe transgenic technology will be the norm.  Thanks.
[Most of the questions so far seem to be based on the health vs risk factors of eating GM plants. I'm aware that transgenic plants can be used for other highly useful tasks such as landline/radiation detection.  Are you working on anything related to non-nutritional issues? If so, what? And are there any major areas that you think GM plants may be incredibly valuable?  Cheers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm4j5?context=5)|Funny you should ask.  We are partnering with a Spanish lab to make a plant that gives a strong visible response at the first onset of pathogen attack.  It is not fertile with other fruits, so it can't cross out to non GMOs.  It will give a visible warning to the farmer that a pathogen is present, allowing precise application of controls. Farmers will use less pesticide/fungicide, less in the environment, huge savings, less fuel, more precise applications, less for consumers to worry about.  It is a fresh project just at the start, but could have wonderful environmental impacts. 
[I guess, a question would be how do you feel about ownership of genes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlwvv?context=5)|Ownership of genes?  In my lab we have a few novel genes we've discovered that can increase fruit size and yield.  If I can patent them, hire more people, train more students, and generate improved products for the industries I care about, I think that's a good thing.  Right now, all on the remote-remote drawing board.  Even if I had a great solution there is no way I could afford to commercialize it.  That's a game only for the Monsantos/Bayers/Dows because of the high barriers set by regualtors.
[Do you believe, based on studies, that GMOs will harm humans in the long run?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlokd?context=5)|Based on the current literature there is no reproducible, independent evidence of harm.  It all comes from the same labs and is not in the best of journals.  I can't say what will happen in the long run- no real scientist can.  However, based on our understanding of the science there is no plausible means that the technology can be harmful any more than traditional breeding.  Thanks.
[Is saving seed illegal and why?  Do you find a living organism that is produced to feed humans, engineered to kill itself frightening and maybe a tad risky?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm8y5?context=5)|This has been the case for 100 years with the introduction of hybrids to protect a company's hard earned intellectual property.  Seeds from hybrids do not produce true-to-type offspring, ensuring re-purchase.  Not new!  Farmers that grow GMO crops agree to not save the seeds- they are the intellectual property of the company.  It is not just GMOs.  Farmers are not allowed to propagate NON-gmo ornamentals, fruits and vegetables protected by plant patents.  These are superior lines that took a long time to create, so their propagation for production is forbidden except for the patent holder.  This provides a means for a scientist or company to continue crop improment efforts.
[1) How are most transgenes inserted?  Viral infection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|Most transgenes are inserted using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a natural, soil bacterium that performs genetic exchange as part of its life cycle. Scientists exploit its innate properties to introduce genes. 
[2) Can you predict what the biggest obstacle that needs to be overcome is before next-gen GMO crops become the norm?  Is it identifying the correct genes/specific alleles necessary to confer drought resistance or whatever, or is it going to be incorporating these genes into the target genome without making unwanted alterations to the resulting plant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|The biggest obstacle will be correcting perception.  Transgenics have been tarnished by fear and disinformation.   I think that cis-genics, or using a plant's own genes to do the work will be the intermediate step, but it is scientifically unnecessary.
[3)In your estimation, how long until a farmer can custom-order a variant of most crops that is optimized for the climate he or she works in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|Coming soon.  I think that GM technolgies will greatly expand ranges and will be used to accelerate traditional breeding in concert with molecular markers.  
[4)If you aren't part of big ag, you may not know this one.  How much of Monsanto's business model relies on the sale of Round-Up?   In other words, would it be economically viable for them to sell seeds for climate resistance, which do not require further purchases, or would this model require seed prices to be too high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|Big Ag built itself on proprietary hybrids that did not need downstream products.  While roundup-ready has a product to use it, Bt corn, cotton etc do not.  These are superior products that farmers choose, and will continue to do so based on performance.
[I find it difficult to accept that GMO and selective breeding equate to the same thing. Can you help me understand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm3ke?context=5)|They are not the same thing.  Selective breeding moves tens of thousands of genes at one time, GMO 1-3.  Much more precise with predictable, traceable outcomes.  Selective breeding takes much longer due to linkage drag and the need to grow generations to fertility... e.g. transgenic apples resistant to scab made in a few years where selective breeding took over fifty.  They absolutely are not the same-- you are right on.
[What kind of research do you do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlqle?context=5)|I work in genomics, mostly in linking genes to the traits they control.  We use GMO technology only as a tool to learn about biology.  All in the lab.  We use this information to guide traditional breeding efforts in strawberries and small, high value fruits.  Unfortunately, even if we have a proven technology that could help farmers, we can't commercialize it.  Too expensive, too much resistance. For now... 
[How hard would it be to make tomatoes produce cannabinoids?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xma85?context=5)|I get emails on this one a few times a year.  I have to be careful and only say that it would be possible to make a BLT that would make you want another one.
[How would you describe your career field to a high school student? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm01z?context=5)|Also- find an internship in a real lab.  Learn how it works.  Find a good role model that can guide your early career decisions.  I train lots of high school students and undergrads- my favorite part of the job!
[Do the chemicals that break down vegetables in my stomach know the difference between GM tomatoes and heritage tomatoes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xly5j?context=5)|Your stomach cannot tell the difference.  The GM/ non-gm are functionally equivalent in that there is no plausible way that the transgenes can affect guy physiology in humans.  That's well established. 
[Do you think companies should be required to label things as GMO?  What are your thoughts on patenting organisms, genes, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm4ay?context=5)|More information is always good, so in theory I'm all for labeling.  However, do we also then have to label intra-specific crosses that move tens of thousands of genes randomly from conventional breeding?  That would be intellectually consistent.  The problem is that the anti-scientists in the anti-GMO movement have scared people to death, and labeling will just provide a target to instill these fears.  I'm a scientist, environmentalist, and have concern for workers and consumers.  I don't fear GMO technology, maybe because I'm so connected to it and understand it.  That's why I'm here.  
[Did you hear Amit got tenured up at Washington State?  Also, do you think that securing funding for your lab effects the quality and direction of your research positively or negatively? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xly67?context=5)|Yikes, an inside question!  Good for Amit- he called me right away.  I'm really happy.   Funding affects the direction of research only in that we need to test hypotheses relevant to the funding agency's wishes.  HOWEVER, funding NEVER influences experimental outcomes.  The results are, what the results are.   The former is a problem.  I find myself moving into areas I'm not comfortable with and spending a lot of time learning new areas just to be able to hire students and postdocs.  However, I'm learning a lot.  Thanks for the questions.
[I find it interesting that you make the specification that funding doesn't influence experimental outcomes, but mention nothing about how funding *can absolutely* influence what is done with that data, whether promoting it or burying it, as well as how the data is presented, which is frequently skewed to be beneficial for the group paying for the research. Thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xncw2?context=5)|Skewed to be beneficial to the group paying for it?  What they are paying for is the Truth.  There is no merit in ""skewing"" data.  Facts always come out and one must never sacrifice a reputation.  Bogus data does no good for a company.  Facts rise to the top sooner or later- they need it sooner especially in litigious times.
[Why do you say that anti-GMO sentiment is anti-science? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xnkda?context=5)|It is anti-science in that the concerns are not substantiated by the peer-reviewed literature.  With your credentials you should be able to see that. Plus, all of your scenarios about protein disruption etc. could just as well apply to naturally occurring transposons and other genetic rearrangements. What about straight-up crosses?  Induced polyploidy?  Spontaneous polyploidy?  All much more intrusive than adding a gene or two (and most labs don't use gene guns these days). Moreover, the allergen argument is not substantiated by the science and chemical concerns are no different than conventional farming.  Intellectual property is not GMO specific either- plants have been patented for well over a century. So the arguments specifically levied against GMO technology are inconsistent with the state of the literature and are intellectually inconsistent with what is done by other breeding efforts.  That is anti-scientific, denial of sound processes. And there is FDA mandated testing. I know people that have been through the long and expensive process.  I'm happy to discuss this further, but being anti-GMO is like being anti-vaccination or anti-climate change.  It is a sentiment inconsistent with the science.
[Do you think that GMOs will significantly alter evolution on a short-term scale, like in the case of Monsanto's Round-Up resistant ""superweeds""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlqn3?context=5)|We have been farming crops (plants) that never were here, don't belong here, and require huge amounts of chemicals/labor/fuel to be here.  It is all unnatural.  The 14 species of Roundup resistant superweeds are just like the hundreds of other superweeds created by more harmful, hazardous chemicals in previous decades. Roundup is safer for workers, the environment and consumer.  Yes, we will need another solution as roundup looses effectiveness, but that's the battle to grow food for our growing planet.  Thanks for a good question.
[Proof that you are ""a public, academic scientist with no ties to Big Ag"", esp the latter part?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm22q?context=5)|Google my username. I'm real!  Plus all of my funding comes through the university, regardless of source, so that's all public record. You can investigate.  
[I have heard that GMO is often used to increase tolerance to pesticides (instead of increasing tolerance to the pests, in order to sell more pesticide), is that true, and any comments? Could it be that it is much easier to provide pesticide tolerance than pest tolerance? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm4zi?context=5)|I think you are confusing herbicide with pesticide.  Some GM plants are made to be herbicide resistant.  That uses more of some herbicides, less of other more toxic ones.   Pesticide resistance? It is true, but it is true of any mechanism to control pests.  What GM /transgenic technology provides is a much more durable mechanism (Bt protein is good example).  It is hard to develop resistance because of its mechanism.  
[Is Monsanto evil?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm8bb?context=5)|I'm a scientist.  I don't like any company dominating market share so much and would love to see new products and new competition. However, lawmakers are owned by Big Ag and activists want regulations and restrictions high.  This is a perfect storm that will ensure Big Ag's long-term survival!
[What do you think of Monsanto and of the constant negative attention it attracts, particularly on Reddit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm7nj?context=5)|I have mixed feelings because I'm a scientist that supports GMO technology, not what companies necessarily do with it.  As stated earlier, those that oppose Monsanto et al should seek to loosen restrictions on deployment and commercialization of GMO technology- let in new competition!  Seems strange, but that's the best way to oppose them.
[If there is ""no reproducible, independent evidence of harm"", why do you think that a lot of Europe has banned gmos?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm9ki?context=5)|Perception and protectionism for resident farmers.  There is no evidence of harm-- only one lab seems to find problems and they are never verified outside of that lab.  If there was hard evidence of harm it would be the biggest story in a long time. If I found it, I would get a Nobel Prize!  Just no evidence at the moment to support a position of danger.
[Thanks for doing this AMA. I feel a lot of people are concerned GM food being 'dangerous' or 'unnatural', and I am glad you are here to correct some of these pre-conceived notions.  Are there any crops that are more difficult to manipulate than others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm9ta?context=5)|You're welcome- important topic with lots of bad information out there.  Some plants, like tobacco, are really easy to work with. Petunia too.
[To expand on the question that was previously asked though... wouldn't you say that GMOs would only have short term gains as general evidence has shown that evolutionary adaptation in harmful organisms such as bacteria, and viruses would neutralize the benefits of genetically forced resistance over the long term? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm1g5?context=5)|But this is not an argument restricted to GMO/ transgenic technology.  All gains are short term in any crop or cultivation system.  Problems find a way back in.  GM technology gives you fast response and ability to mount a counter-response faster than traditional breeding or alteration of cultivation techniques.  Plus, it is much easier to pyramid transgenic traits without associated linkage drag (ask me if you don't know that one).  Thanks.
[1. Are any seeds sold in stores GMOs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xre9c?context=5)|None for sale.  Highly regulated.  I can't even send transgenic research seeds without paperwork. 
[2. why do you go straight for a lab solution rather than rely on tricks that have been used for hundreds of years to increase yield and repel pests? I use companion planting, and certain plants that attract parasitic and predatory insects, lizards, and pollinators, as well as make my own compost, and provide bee hotels. I never have problems, and they're cheap and easy. Why rely on something expensive? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xre9c?context=5)|Your second solution is nice, but can't be adapted for a production scale without increasing food costs through the roof.  It is hard to manage one crop, let alone intercroppings, at least on an industrial scale.  Plus, when the technology is safe, why bother?
[How would [you] feel if all/some/future GMO research, development and eventual products were 'NON-PROFIT' and publicly owned? Sort of like NASA, so that all of the benefits of all things GMO would remain to benefit the peoples that supported this science and research and not individual corporations and stockholders?   [Edits]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xn04r?context=5)|Would be nice, but you know as well as I do that NASA is out of business and that privatization of space is the sustainable model.

However, I have found some really good info on this subreddit and enjoy the peeps here. So here are the details..

Wedding Date: 09/08/2012
      We would like to leave for the honeymoon on the following Monday (09/10) and go for about a week.

Budget: $2000-3000
     This includes flights and hotel.  Spending we can figure later.

Personal Preferences:
       I would like to use this opportunity of travel to get my passport and put it to use by getting out of the country.  I have camped and traveled all over this beautiful State of ours and the boarding States.  My beautiful fiancee has been able to travel to many different locations listed below.

Mexico- study abroad trip through college, mostly central and western MX.
Costa Rica- Teenage church youth group thing
Seattle- Vacation
Florida (Ft. Myers)- Internship
NY, NY- Vacation

So preferably we would be able to travel somewhere where neither of us have been to make it more special.  

If any of you have any suggestions they are more than welcome.  Even if you have some suggestions where to x-post this it would be helpful too.  Thanks so much.


TL;DR: Looking for honeymoon ideas outta the country for about $2000-3000 in September 2012."

To me, the carsnoble seems more formal, as it's most of my first name and my last name, but the Mango.Tux is the one I check more often, and the Tux is a reference to Linux, which I think \*might* be worth a bit more credit for a programming job.

This girl is my best friend and I will probably always love her no matter how things end up. She graduates from school in a few months and has this really great chance for a 1yr + internship in Boston, NY, or NJ (we currently live on the western part of the country) and may end up staying out of state beyond the 1yr if she finds a grad school she likes out there. Now the hard thing is that she wants me to move with her to where ever she ends up going and I flat out told her I wasn't comfortable with that **at all!** I don't even feel comfortable with moving in with her right now let alone leaving everything else behind to move across the country. I told her to go if she gets the opportunity because I'll be damned if I'm the thing to hold her back. The hard part about this is that we already tried the long distance thing at the beginning of her schooling 4 years ago and ended up breaking up for the first year that she was gone. She wants to go and would be willing to try the long distance thing again and keeps asking about my thoughts on doing LDR again. She also wants to try even though she seem hopeful it would work based on past experience and quite frankly I don't even want to try a LDR again (horrible shit). Every time she brings it up she basically leaves the decision on me about what we are going to do and I don't know what to do Reddit. Every time I think about it, something in me can't help but start counting down to the (final) end of our relationship even though I don't want it to end. Any advice? (sorry for the giant wall of text) and I will be happy to clarify anything if need be. Thanks in advance.

Thank you for your time but I find it interesting that I was overlooked for this position when I was the Media Intern last summer. I helped the IT Department promote their Internship program by creating videos and helped put together a fantastic video for a meeting that was a seasonal update about Connect. I also helped create promotional material for the Mentor program and an instructional video on how to set up their conference phones. So it surely can't be credentials.

I would probably use her as a reference still (I am guessing she would say something non-specific to potential employers) since I don't have too many other contacts in the field.  I am always tempted to send her a message to sort of apologize though, so she knows that I realize how lame I was and that I'm at least somewhat better now.

This morning I received an email titled, ""Awful Trip....Please help!""

Here's the email:

Hello
How's everything on your end? This has had to come in a hurry and it has left me in a devastating state. I traveled to Spain for a voluntary Training Program (VTP). The program was successful, but my journey turned sour. I misplaced my wallet on my way back to my hotel after I went for sight seeing. The wallet contained all my valuables. Now, my passport is in custody of the hotel management pending the time I settle my bills.
I've been to the Embassy, but I was only cleared of my traveling documents since i came in on unofficial purposes.
My return flight back home is scheduled to leave tomorrow but I have to settle hotel bills before I am allowed to leave.
Now am freaked out....Please I need your help.
I will be indeed very grateful if I can get a loan of $1,250 from you. This will enable me sort my hotel bills and get my sorry self back home.
I will really appreciate whatever you can afford in assisting me with. I promise to refund it in full as soon as I return.
You can get it across to me via Western Union to my name and this address
Name: Jane
Location: Calle de Serrano, 12

Let me know if you can be of any assistance.
Thanks so much.

So between the poor grammar, the email address jane@ymail.com, and the physical impossibility of Jane being in Spain, I know this is a scam. Having read about counter-scammers first on Reddit, I'm inclined to get this guy good. 

So Reddit, what do?

tl;dr Obvious scam is obvious. Time to set him up the base. What do?

qjukd,13,2012-03-06,I am a QA engineer and I hate my job :( Help,mad_max_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qjukd/i_am_a_qa_engineer_and_i_hate_my_job_help/,"Dear Reddit,

Just to give some history, I have a Bachelors in CS which I followed up immediately with a Masters in Computer Engineering. School was a great learning experience and some of my favorite classes were Concurrent Programming, Algorithms, Operating Systems and Computer Networks. 

When I graduated, I started looking for a job with some of the biggest software companies around. However,  the times were rotten and the economy was FUBAR. After months of unemployment and failing to get a job offer from the dozens of interviews that I attended, I was finally offered a role with one of the biggest software companies out there. The catch was that it was a QA and not a dev job but I was desperate for anything and I had student loans to pay off. In retrospect, that might have been the worst decision I've made in my life. 

It was exciting initially - I had my first real job and the pay (to me) seemed fantastic. Flexible hours, stock options and a great boss, I had it all. However, then the excitement wore off and I started hating my job. The only times that I felt good about my work was when I was developing test automation but that was a really small part of my job. For the most part, I was running tests manually and filing bugs. I also realized that QA people are looked down upon by most developers in the industry. I started feeling that I wasn't utilizing anything that I learned in school and that I had wasted all those years of education. I also found out that I was woefully underpaid in comparison to the industry average. So I started looking for a new job.

So after one and a half years of working for my first employer, I started working for a second employer with a significant pay increase ALSO in a QA role. I told myself that the increased pay would make me like QA and make up for the downsides. Boy, was I wrong! I've been with this company for three years and I hate this job as much as the last. I've realized that the only way I'm going to be happy is if I find a full-time development role. I'm interested in system programming, writing device drivers and operating system kernels. However, with the kind of experience that I have on my resume, the only kind of job offers that I get are QA related.

What advice does reddit have for me? Here is what I've thought of:

1) Writing open source code: I've actually been trying to contribute for a long time but its so freaking hard to get started. How do I find a project I like? How do I contribute to that project?
2) Working on side projects outside of work: Again, with my relative lack of experience and because of my full time job, its hard for me to just write a project on my own
3) Apply for programming internships. Is this even an option given that I'm not a fresh college graduate any more?

TL;DR I am a QA engineer who hates this line of work after working two years in this industry. I'm desperately looking to move on to full time development roles but I'm getting typecasted into QA positions because of my prior work experience.

Please forgive any grammatical and spelling errors; English isn't my first language :) I'd sincerely appreciate any advice that Reddit has to give."
qjt7q,19,2012-03-06,Ethical and Legal Questions Regarding an Accounting Intern Becoming Aware of a Possible Fraud and Investigation. What Should I Do?,FutureCPAneedshelp,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/qjt7q/ethical_and_legal_questions_regarding_an/,"**Forward:**

I would like to thank each of you for your interest in the post, firstly.  I understand that all the postings in response to this are merely the opinions of the poster, regardless of that individual’s accreditation, and I will not consider it legal advice or counsel; instead, solely as friendly opinions and points of discussion. I would prefer that opinions be supported with accredited sources when applicable. Again, thank you all for your incite and perspectives, trust that all information you can provide will be taken to heart. 

**Background:**

I am a senior undergraduate accounting major at a small, private, not-for-profit university. Because of the nature of the underlying questions involved in this posting and the confidentiality involved I will not disclose the name of the university. I am currently employed as the Intern to the Finance Department of that university, in which I work directly under the CFO/Treasurer/EVP of Finance, the Director of Risk Management/Assistant VP of Finance, and the Director of Compliance and Tax Issues. Additionally, I am currently wrapping up my 150 with plans to sit for all four sections of the CPA during the summer, after I graduate in May. Following my graduation, I have an offer to begin in the fall with a CPA firm as an auditor; I previously worked as a tax/audit intern with the firm. That firm currently audits the financial statement of the university of which I am employed and attend, however, though a different office than that which I would be employed and with a different partner than that I would work under.

**Situation:** 

Within the past week I became aware that a number of professors at my university, including one in the accounting department who informed me, believe that there may be a number of material misrepresentations in the university’s Form 990 (the not-for-profit tax return, issued to the IRS and disclosed to the public) and the possibility of a number of illegal accounting activities, as a result of management fraud. Specifically, to the best of my knowledge, the group of professors believes that three identifiable frauds may be occurring: misstatements in the 990 compensation disclosures, misrepresentations in the 990 treatment of our art collection, and the unlawful and fraudulent use of proceeds from the sale of assets included in that art collection. 

Firstly, this group of professors believes that the 990 form misrepresents the university it its disclosures related to the compensation; however, not the specific dollar values, but rather the related yes or no questions. I have no knowledge to suggest this accusation has any merit and have very limited knowledge as to the evidence or knowledge being used by the group of professors unofficially investigating the issue. 

However, I am more aware of the circumstances of possible fraud relating to the art collection and the use of its proceeds and its treatment on the 990. Our university has long held an art collection valued at roughly 1.5 million dollars which was reflected on both the audited financial statements and the 990 form until 3 years ago. At that time our university came under new management, including a new President and a new CFO/Treasurer/EVP of Finance. Apparently, under that new management the university decided that the art collection should be liquidated and assigned the accounting professor mentioned previously, along with others, to investigate how to go about the liquidation process. He informed me that he recommended that the university’s only options were to either reinvest the proceeds back into the art collection or donate the collection to a not-for-profit which could be better suited for the collection. He also informed me that the following year the art collection was no longer shown on the 990.

Since the conversation, I have started looking into the issue myself. I came to a similar conclusion regarding the proper treatment of art collections and the required reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of art collections, as is outlined in SFAS 116 and FASB ASC 958. Also, I have compared the audited financial statements against the 990 to confirm that the art collection still exists, and is shown as “Art Collection” on the audited financials, but shown as “Other” under the Part VI disclosure of the Schedule D attached the 990. Additionally, the 990 has a series of questions and additional disclosures related to art collections, these are either unanswered or answered in contrary to the existence of an art collection on the 990. My understanding of the instructions regarding the 990 would require alternative answers to those provided by management in the case of our art collections, and the purpose with which they were donated and had been capitalized and recognized. 

Today I was informed by one of my direct supervisors that I would be involved in the liquidation of some of the university’s art. I asked him what purpose the university was planning on using the proceeds of the sale of the pieces for and he informed me that the funds would be uses as general revenue and would go into our general fund without restrictions. Also, I asked what percentage of the collection we were planning on liquidating and he informed me that the pieces we were planning on liquidating where not included in our collection according to the financial statements, the collection is stored at a local art museum. These pieces were assorted items with which we had been unable to valuate and properly keep track of. He said there are inadequate records regarding these pieces and that updating and compiling those records would be the majority of my duties related to the liquidation. 

**Request for Advice:**

I would appreciate any additional understanding you could pass onto me regarding the proper treatment of these items and please correct any misunderstanding I may have regarding the regulations and laws related. 

I am looking for advice regarding how best to handle the situation in general. It is important to me that I uphold the code of conduct of the AICPA and avoid any unlawful and unethical actions during the remainder of my employment at the university. 

My university does have a whistleblower policy which I will be forced to utilize if I find any substantive evidence of fraud; I would appreciate any incite as to when/if you think I should use this. 

What disclosures am I required, permitted, discouraged, or prohibited from making to my department, the professors, and my CPA firm which audits the university?

What would you do in my situation?

Any other advise you think would be useful. 

**Current Opinion:**

I am currently leaning toward a course of action which will try and avoid involvement in the situation. I believe that I should make my supervisors aware of the restrictions and regulations related to art collections and inform them of my opinions regarding 990 disclosures related to art collections. Also, I believe I should inform them that “I have become aware of concerns related to the answers provided in the 990 form” and leave it at that. I may also have to request not to be involved in the art liquidation process. Additionally, I thought I would inform the professor I spoke to (and am currently taking an accounting ethics course with) that I was going to make this disclosure to my supervisors. Also, I do not believe I can inform the CPA firm of any of this because it is confidential information I acquired outside of my employment with them. 

**Conclusion:**

Thank you again for your input and concern. I truly appreciate any insight you all can offer and will consider it thoroughly. As I am sure you all can see, I really feel as though I have no other good source to seek counsel from, with my future firm, supervisors, and professors all intimately involved. As stated above I would prefer any references to creditable sources when available just because of the nature of reddit and the fact that I may have to support my positions in the future if an investigation ensues.

[So my question is: Do you approve this behavior from your lawyers, do they work without much oversight? And did you make the call to have ""Math Keyboard"" removed from the android market?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxexq?context=5)|I'm afraid I know absolutely nothing about your Math Keyboard.  Quick web search gives https://market.android.com/details?id=net.schwiz.wolfram.full&amp;hl=en  No idea what the ""wolfram"" URL or the Wolfram Alpha picture on the page are doing.  Seems like something to work out with lawyers; can't imagine it should be difficult...
[What is the most interesting use of Mathematica and/or Wolfram Alpha you've ever seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xx994?context=5)|There are so many; very hard to pick just one.  An old one for Mathematica: Mike Foale was using it on the Mir space station; there was an accident; the computer it was on got sucked into space; Mike had a backup disk, but needed a password for a different computer; all-time favorite call to customer service ... and finally an in-action solving of equations of motion for a spinning space station.  Of course, for me personally, my favorite Mathematica ""uses"" are the research for A New Kind of Science, Wolfram Alpha ... and the building of Mathematica itself.
[Thanks for doing this AMA. I had a question in regards to intelligence in children as it relates to their education and socialization. Your wikipedia page states that your intelligence made it difficult to teach you as a child. You were no doubt bored. Was there anything you wish your parents had done differently to make that go smoother as a child? What about social skills? Kids who are much smarter than their peers tend to find it hard to relate or just lack interest in social skills. This makes it hard for them to make and find friends and can lead to self esteem issues in some cases. Was that the case for you? Any advice there?  As an unrelated question, what do you think is the single most important thing for the US to do in order to regain prominence as a first class educator of children?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxc6y?context=5)|I went to some very good schools in England, and typically did rather well.  However, starting from probably age 8 or so, I ended up learning the things I was really interested in outside of school, from books, etc. (I wish the web had existed; it would have saved an awful lot of bicycle trips to a library).   I guess I never had much trouble with ""self esteem"" as such.  I had a self image of being a ""science type"".  And that made it a little more difficult to realize that I could and should do things like starting companies.  I think it's often challenging in the educational system for people to understand with clarity (a) what they're really good at, and interested in, and (b) what kinds of niches there are in the world.  Too often, people get tracked according to what they happen to do well at early on, and never think outside.  In that model, I would have done much less interesting things...
[Would you consider open sourcing obsolete versions of Mathematica?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxgx3?context=5)|We've thought about things like this from time to time, but it's never seemed to make much sense.  It seems like the wrong thing for people to be using obsolete software, and it destroys uniform compatibility of programs written in the Mathematica language (""is it for the obsolete Mathematica, or the real one?"", etc.)  A slightly different issue making aspects of Mathematica freely available.  We've done that recently with our CDF initiative for computable documents (http://www.wolfram.com/cdf ), and it seems to be working well.  For nearly 20 years we've thought about making the ""pure language"" aspects of Mathematica more freely available (in fact, for example, that was what Sergey Brin worked on when he was an intern at our company long ago...)  And I think we may finally soon figure out the right way to do this.  It'll probably be related to my goal in the next year or two of making Mathematica definitively the world's easiest to learn language...
[Are there any uses for WA that are not typically exploited by users?  Any underused functions that we should know about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxdcy?context=5)|It's a big challenge letting people know everything that's in Wolfram Alpha.  We try to talk about highlights on blog.wolframalpha.com  Probably the best place to look for an overview is www.wolframalpha.com/examples.
[What do you think Wolfram Alpha will be able to do in 10 years that is impossible today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxgwa?context=5)|There'll be quantitative changes in the amount of knowledge in the system that I suspect will have a qualitative effect on how it's used.  And there'll be all sorts of computations that become possible because (one assumes) there'll be faster computers that we can use.  In Wolfram Alpha Pro we just started handling input not just of small textual queries, but of data and things like images.  As more processing power is available, there'll be some exciting new things to do with those.  Another direction is the ability for Wolfram Alpha to ""invent"".  Right now it mostly uses existing methods, models, algorithms to compute things.  What I'm expecting in the future is that Wolfram Alpha will be to discover new methods, models and algorithms on the fly.  We already do quite a bit of this in our own algorithm development, using ideas I developed in A New Kind of Science.  The general idea is to define a task or objective, then search the computational universe for a way to achieve it.  The results are often surprising and ""clever"".  An example of this kind of thing is tones.wolfram.com  Another thing that will change a lot in 10 years is the way of accessing Wolfram Alpha.  With Siri, for example, we're seeing voice.   There'll be all sorts of interesting directions with augmented reality, etc. etc.
[How did WA end up as the go-to for Siri?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xx7qj?context=5)|Our company and I had a long relationship with Apple and Steve Jobs (see e.g. http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2011/10/steve-jobs-a-few-memories/ )  We'd also started working the Siri team before their company was bought by Apple. 
[What are your opinions on Matlab?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxhvt?context=5)|Needless to say, I'm not a Matlab user, so I'm not a big expert.  Matlab has certainly at times tried to position itself as a competitor to Mathematica (I'm pretty sure they got the term ""technical computing"" from a talk I gave---even though I never liked the term in first place).  I haven't run into the authors of Matlab for a very long time ... but my impression is that their goals are rather more modest (at least at a conceptual level) than ours.  My goal with Mathematica has been to cover all areas where systematic computation can be done.  And to achieve that, we've built a very general system, based on symbolic programming and symbolic expressions.  Matlab is very centered specifically on numerical matrices (hence the name).  Over the years, I've actually been surprised at how much can be turned into a numerical matrix---but ultimately it's a narrow slice of the world, and I think that's now becoming clearer and clearer.  In the complete web of algorithms in Mathematica, things that can reasonably be represented as numerical matrices are perhaps 5 or 10% of the total.  By the way, even in terms of numerical matrices, Mathematica is no slouch at this point.  20 years ago Mathematica would have been slower than Matlab at crunching some big numerical matrix.  But that's no longer the case ... and in a great many areas, we're able to implement much more advanced algorithms, because in Mathematica we can call on other other capabilities (algebraic, geometric, combinatorial, etc.) to get things done.  Another very important issue is one of philosophy.  In Mathematica, my goal has been to make a single coherent system in which one can work, and in which everything fits nicely together.  It takes a lot of effort to do this (I've personally spent a large swath of my life doing all the necessary design work).  But it's tremendously powerful in actually using (and learning) a system.   My impression is that Matlab has taken a different approach, having specific packages that are quite separate (and even bought separately) for different areas, and not really worrying about how they fit together.  Another issue of philosophy is automation.  My big idea for Mathematica has been to be able to ""delegate"" to it as much as possible: I want to just tell the system what I want to do, and I want it to be able to figure out how it should be done.  So if there are hundreds of different possible algorithms, I want the system to automatically be able to figure out the best one (unless I happen to feel like tweaking it).  In our algorithm development, figuring out how to do this kind of automation is a big part ... but in my experience it's crucial in being able to use a system efficiently.   When I look (which I don't often) at Matlab code, I have to admit to being reminded a little of Fortran (which was one of my first programming languages a very long time ago).  Mathematica obviously looks very different (not least because it's a symbolic functional programming language), and even after 25 years, still looks completely modern.  (Of course, in Mathematica there's now the quite different possibility of typing pure natural language, which gets interpreted through Wolfram Alpha.)  There's probably lots more to say here.  One thing I might mention is that closely connected to Matlab is Simulink.  We have a major initiative in large-scale systems modeling that I talked a little bit about in:  http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2011/03/launching-a-new-era-in-large-scale-systems-modeling/  There are some pretty exciting things in the works here, linking Modelica modeling with Mathematica and with Wolfram Alpha.  I think the landscape for these kinds of things is going to change a lot in the next few years.  One more thing: as a practical matter, we're seeing more and more of Matlab's traditional engineering users not just being interested in Mathematica, but routinely using Wolfram Alpha.  Again ... I think there are interesting things ahead here.
[What is your opinion on Khan Academy? How do you see education in math and science evolving in the next 10 years as computers become even more central?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxoke?context=5)|It's been a little frustrating to watch over the years how slowly things in math and science education have been evolving.  Back when Mathematica first came out nearly 24 years ago, people started doing things with it in education.  And a lot of very nice work has been done.  But I can't help but think there's a lot more that can be done.  Given the current curriculum (e.g. in math) we can do much better at letting individual students move forward at their own pace, e.g. using Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha as computational engines.  But one thing to realize is that most of the current math curriculum was set up a century ago, when the world was very different.  And I strongly believe that it's worth rethinking it, given our current tools, and the current uses that math has in the world.  We have an initiative called ""Computer-Based Math"" (http://www.computerbasedmath.org ) that's exploring this.  One thing that's really nice given Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha is that people can much more immediately do ""real-world"" math and science, exploring genuine questions, not toy ones.  Another educational ""experiment"" of ours is the Wolfram Science Summer School ( http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2012/ ) which we've been running for 9 years.  The idea there is that people come and do an original research project.  (One of my roles there is a piece of ""extreme professoring"" ... trying to figure out an appropriate project for each person, given their interests and experience.)  I always start the summer school by doing a ""live experiment"" with Mathematica, and trying to discover something new in a couple of hours.  (So far, it's never failed.)  I think it's great for people to see that it's possible to discover new things---and that's then reinforced in the projects they do themselves.  I don't think every teacher is going to be able to pull off making discoveries with live experiments, but I think there are ways to get closer to that.  I've developed quite a few opinions about what the future of at least ""high achieving education"" should be ... mostly centered on the idea of people being helped in doing ""their own projects"", rather than being fed standardized courses and curricula.  Gosh ... there's a lot more to say about this.  E.g. about treating NKS as a ""pre computer science"" subject; about teaching Mathematica as a language to young kids (small inputs -&gt; exciting outputs); etc. etc.  
[Can you comment on Khan Academy? Awesome answer by the way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3y04bd?context=5)|I really like the concept of Khan Academy, and the whole idea of ""self service education"".  This is clearly the future.  I don't think we've yet hired anyone whose complete education came from places like this ... but I'm sure it will happen.  I've enjoyed meeting Sal Khan, and it's wonderful to see his enthusiasm for the subjects he covers.  It's also nice to see Wolfram Alpha making cameo appearances in recent videos, alongside ""pen and paper"".  (Hmmm ... now I'm thinking about how this might relate to the handwriting-based Wolfram Alpha that was demoed last week by Samsung on their new tablets at Mobile World...) 
[What was the most difficult technical or design problem that you had to solve during the development of Wolfram Alpha? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xx9ea?context=5)|I'd been used to building Mathematica, which is a very systematic and coherently designed language, with no visible ""heuristics"".  In Wolfram Alpha, heuristics are central; our goal is to make it just ""do what anyone means"".   It took me a while to really get into designing a tight system that's so much based on heuristics.  There were many technical issues for Wolfram Alpha that I thought might just make it all impossible: too much data in the world; too slow to compute useful things; impossible to understand natural language; etc.   Fortunately we got through all of these.  One thing to mention is that when one's dealing with natural language, ordinary notions of system modularity tend to go away; a small change in something to do with chemistry might affect some interpretation in finance.  It's been interesting to build development and QA systems around all that.   
[(1-2^1-s ) f(s) = 1^-s - 2^-s + 3^-s - ...  For complex s with positive real part. How can I find all zeros of this function with Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxmie?context=5)|Type ""1^-s + 2^-s + 3^-s + ..."" into Wolfram Alpha ... wow!  I'm impressed that it can figure out that this is the Riemann zeta function...
[Do you believe that the 'Technological Singularity' is coming, and if so, when? How soon do you think we will see AI pass the Turing test?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxjto?context=5)|I think the Turing test will creep up on us.  There will be more and more ""outsourcing"" of human activities (remembering things, figuring things out, recognizing things, etc.) to automated systems.  And the line between what's human and what's machine will blur.  For example, I wouldn't be surprised if a future Wolfram Alpha wouldn't be inserted in the loop for peoples' email or texts: if you want to ask someone a simple question, their ""AI"" might respond for them.  A thing to understand about AI (that took me a long time to realize): there's really no such thing as ""raw general intelligence"".  It's all just computation---that's one of the big things I figured out in A New Kind of Science (e.g. http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-12.10 ).  (Actually, it was this observation that made me realize Wolfram Alpha might be possible now, without us first having constructed a general AI.)  The issue is not to get something ""intelligent""; it's to get something with human-like intelligence.  And that's all about details of human knowledge and the human condition.   Long story ....   Here are a few more thoughts: http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2011/10/imagining-the-future-with-a-new-kind-of-science/
[What got you into mathematics in the first place? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxh5c?context=5)|Actually, I was first interested in physics ... and I learned mathematics as support for that. 
[If it isn't too bold a question, how do you feel about the often circulated letter to you from Feynman? In particular, how do you feel his comments have stood the test of time? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxx4z?context=5)|I wrote a bit about my interactions with Feynman in: http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/recent/feynman/  About the letter of Feynman's that you link to:  I think it's an interesting letter, though I would claim it's more about Feynman than about me.  Feynman himself didn't like doing management kinds of things; he believed he was bad at them, though actually I think he was much better at them than he thought.
[Your projects have been great success and are used worldwide and you've successfully run a large organisation for many years. Have you avoided the managing side of things that Feynman warned you about, or have you enjoyed it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxx4z?context=5)|Richard Feynman and I worked on quite a few projects together.  One example was ""quantum computers"" back around 1980, way before almost anyone thought about quantum computers.  I guess I have always liked people, and interacting with people ... and for me managing projects and organizations is interesting and satisfying.
[How is ""A New Kind of Science"" faring in the scientific community as of lately?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxcs8?context=5)|There's a lot to say here.  There's both interesting science to talk about, and there's interesting history, philosophy and sociology of science.  Later this year, it'll be the 10th anniversary of the publication of A New Kind of Science, and I'm hoping to be able to write some serious assessments at that time.  Personally, pretty much what's happened is what I expected would happen (and even said in the Preface to the book).  Some good things have happened quickly, others inevitably take a long time.  It's all rather classically ""paradigm shifty"".  I'm pretty happy with what's in the NKS book, and I continue to be pleased at the number of people who are ""discovering"" the book, and reading it in remarkable detail.  As with any project this ""paradigm shifty"", there will be people who think (or at least say) that it's all nonsense.  I know that some of the people who made a lot of noise when the book came out have subsequently decided it's a lot more sensible than they at first thought.  But I certainly can't say about all of them.  I didn't make a big effort to read all the comments and reviews when the book first came out; in fact I made the conscious decision not to engage in ""answering critics"" right then.  I'm thinking for the 10th anniversary of reading all the stuff that got written, and then contacting some of the more vigorous critics and setting up some appropriate forum (Reddit ??) to interact with them...  
[I wonder what does Stephen think. Do you think P=NP or P≠NP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xy53q?context=5)|I suspect that it may be undecidable ... i.e. independent of typical axiom systems.  An interesting approach to it is an empirical one based on enumerating simple programs.  See e.g. http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-12.8 for the beginning of that.  Some more work on this has been done by several people at our NKS Summer School. 
[How are your mental math skills?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxaku?context=5)|I always used to think they were terrible ... and that was part of the reason I started a very long time ago using computers to do calculations for me.  However, I have a pretty good memory, and by now I finally know almost every element in the 12x12 multiplication table :-)   Also, I think the general level of mental math skills in the population is degrading ... so mine are looking better and better relative to the average.  You might have noticed that Wolfram Alpha now gives some mental math time estimates for simple computations (e.g. ""6+7"").  I'm embarrassed to say that I don't always get them in the time it claims for adults... :-)

",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qjsa9/what_is_it_like_to_work_as_a_pharmacist/,"Hi! I'm in college as a physics major right now, and over the past several semesters I've grown to utterly despise my major; I don't even *want* to work in a math- or engineering-based field anymore, or, god forbid, academia, so lately I've been looking into other majors, and the possible career paths they could provide.

During this research, I also looked into going pre-pharm, and it seems like a really good idea. For one thing, I'm actually somewhat interested in chemistry and pharmacology, and from what I've researched online it seems like a very high-paying job ($100K+), with a lot of job openings in the future. Also, *hopefully* it will be less stressful to me than what I am doing now.

My first question is: assuming I'm a physics major in my junior year, what steps could/should I take *right now* if I wanted to switch paths and instead study to become a pharmacist? Do people in pre-pharm programs benefit from internships, or is there something else I should also be doing to prepare for pharmacy school / getting a job? *Can I even go into pre-pharm if I'm a physics major?*

Also, if anyone who sees my thread is a pharmacist, or is studying to be one, what is your job like? Like, what kinds of things do you have to do on a day-to-day basis, and do you like it? How do you feel about the hours, the pay, and the people you interact with on a day-to-day basis? Any advice or help would be enormously appreciated."

Up until now I've been avoiding job searching due to some problems with my family and my life in general. I'm now ready to start making up for my lost time.

My resume is currently fairly bare. I have no accomplishments or internships that I did during my years at college, though I had an online store manager job fro 2006~2010. I know how bad this looks, and I'm currently in the process of learning HTML/PHP as well as introducing myself to CMS stuff to pad out my resume. On top of that though, I need to practice my programming. **What kind of stuff, that is around my level, can I do that will look decent as part of a portfolio?** The only thing I've done lately is perl and AHK scripts, which I doubt would look great anywhere.

Second: Because I'm looking to learn more programming/web development on my own time, I've decided to pick up IT jobs instead of programming-related jobs so I can actually have money to start paying back my loans - and eventually be more attractive for programming-related jobs.

It is my motivation for everything in my life.",Cat_Fish,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/qjo1v/hi_getmotivated_im_new_here_but_i_have_a_story_i/,"Hello everyone. I'm Cat_Fish, I'm a 19-year old college student and I have a story I want to share with you. It will be pretty lengthy, but its something that I really think will help anyone who wants to get motivated for the gym, and possibly life in general.

When I was 18 in my senior year of high school, I was 5'4"" and 175 lbs. of out-of-shape-ness. That January, I came to the conclusion that it was time to make a difference in my physique and life mind-set. I decided to get the jump start on my fitness goals through our school's ski trip, which ran from January 21st to January 24th. The plan was to take a bus to Vermont from New Jersey and snowboard all weekend on various mountains. It was my last time on the trip and I was excited to beat the hell out of myself on a mountain.

Now I ask: Do you remember where you were January 21st, 2010? I do. 

I was coming up to a bend, where out of nowhere another skier cut me off. I had no choice but to avoid collision. However, my stop wasn't clean and shot me down the slope *horizontally*. I went off the trail, and hit my right leg on a fallen, dead tree. Instead of hitting my boot, it hit *right above* it, shattering my right leg. After an hour of screaming for help, a respiratory therapist found a scared, raspy-voiced boy. After being rushed to the hospital, and getting these [gnarly X-rays](http://imgur.com/a/8hadQ), and going straight into surgery, I woke up about 17 hours later to find that my leg had 4 screws and a metal rod in it. Now conscious, my surgeon came in to check on me and asked me to wiggle my toes. I wiggled them down successfully, but coming up didn't happen. My surgeon got nervous and, after checking over and over again, I had developed [Compartment Syndrome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002204/). Basically, there is a compartment in our right shin just off to the right that filled with so much fluid, it choked my nerve and killing off a chunk of muscle in my leg (NOTE: I tried taking a picture of this, but couldn't get a clear one at the moment.). To counter the compartment syndrome, they made a six-inch incision on the compartment, releasing the pressure that was destroying my leg. This was my 2nd surgery in 3 days. I do not remember anything of day 4 unfortunately, but on day 5, I figured out why my leg was in so much pain still.

On day 5, my surgeon came in and notified me they had to ""clean my wound"". I was completely baffled,""What the hell do you mean you have to *clean* it?"" And then, I saw it: underneath my splint was a completely open wound that had been sitting there. I saw the muscle and everything. I was in so much pain because the swelling had not settled yet and the incision that was made was unable to be closed in the surgery. 

Fuck my life.

2 more surgeries occured in the following 4 days, but nothing was like the hell I wasn't prepared for on my last night. You see: The doctors were basically feeding me Percoset. I was dependent on them to sleep somewhat soundly, but I hadn't eaten in 4 days and it was making me sick to my stomach. I quit all my narcotic pain meds cold turkey my last night. Welcome to hell night. I endured cold sweats, 4 vomiting fits, 2 panic attacks and 0 hours of sleep. Oh, did I mention I was going into surgery the next day? So no food or water. After vomitting up nothing, being dehydrated, anxiety attacks, cold sweats, and exhaustion for an entire night, I was wheeled into my 5th and final surgery to close that open wound on my leg. 

Thankfully, it was successful.

I woke up from the surgery happy, clean, free of pain and pain meds and eating my first meal in 6 days: spaghetti and meatballs. Absolutely delicious. Afterwards, my mom and I drove back straight from Vermont to New Jersey in one shot, where I had the most delicious burrito of my entire life.

But wait, the story continues. 3 Months later...

I'm finally back in New Jersey, on crutches, with a cast.

After being in a massive, bulky, heavy cast for so long, it was opened to reveal that my right leg was at a 45 degree angle. My surgeons had not rotated my leg back when they put in the metal rod, causing a HUGE problem. If I did not fix it, I would never be able to run again, and a 95% chance of getting arthritis in my knee and hip, as soon as the age of 30. What could I do to fix something like this? 

I had to give consent to another surgeon to re-break my leg, twist it back, and insert a new metal rod into it.

Great. Another surgery. This one, however, was successful after one surgery. It was a clean, one night stay at the hospital and I was on my way.

Fast forward 8 months of physical therapy 4 times a week, and I was able to finally support my own weight successfully without limping, just in time for college!

On my first day of college in september of 2010, I met a kid named Dan. Dan was a well-built kid with beaming confidence and a unique ability to rally everyone to have fun. Perfect best-friend material. He pushed me to start going to the gym with him as soon as I had felt ready. I took the last 3 months of 2010 to get my legs back to where I felt comfortable to lift. 

On January 3rd, 2011, I performed my first squat. It was 60 lbs. I was sore for 3 straight days. Dan, however, performed a 175 lbs. squat. I told him that, one day, he will see me rep that much weight as well.

He held me to it.

I went to the gym with Dan 3 days a week and hung out with him 7 days a week. We went from total strangers to best friends in a matter of months. He was there for a lot of firsts in my life: such as my first time lifting seriously at the gym and including my first time smoking marijuana. We went to tons of concerts and generally just chilled all the time.

After 4 months of lifting, it became a lifestyle change for me. I had lost weight, gained substantial muscle, and gained more confidence than I ever had. The only person I had to thank was Dan.

My squat weight was up to 135 lbs.

At the end of the year, I was excited to be able to hang out with my friend over the summer, but it was postponed. Dan had suffered a seizure back at his home in Pennsylvania which side-lined any driving for him for a while. So in the mean time, I went to the gym rather casually (due to distance and work) and enjoyed some time at home with my friends and family.

No problem though. He recovered over the summer and we hung out again once school started up.

Back at college in September of 2011, me and Dan went right back to our usual way of hanging out all the time. We continued going to the gym and hanging out with all of our old floor mates and friends. 

Everything was completely normal, although my squat had totally plateaued at 150 lbs.

Fast forward. On November 18th, 2011, Do you remember where you were? Because I do.

I had started my internship and I was leaving work at 2:30 P.M. on a rather chilly November afternoon. I had made plans to go to another concert with Dan and mosh all night. But it was interrupted. I received a call from an old floor mate of mine asking if I had heard what happened to Dan. Confused and concerned I asked what happened to him. 

I was informed that he had attended a concert and suffered another seizure afterwards. Complications from the seizure took my friend's life that pervious night.

I honestly cannot put into words how I felt at that moment, nor the weeks and months that followed. It destroyed me from the inside out.

I had entered a serious state of depression. I felt convinced that there was nothing in this life worthwhile. I felt almost suicidal. I sat in my apartment, lethargic, feeling like I'm just waiting for death. I was completely miserable. Days felt like blurs and I was a void of motivation and happiness.

But I couldn't live like this. I knew that this was an insult to Dan's memory and lifestyle. He lived life to the fullest and made sure that he, and everyone around him, was happy. I realized I couldn't just sit here on my couch and feel like I'm just waiting to die.

I got up and started hitting the gym again, harder than I ever did before.

What this comes down to is that on December 18th, 2011, I squated 175 lbs. I had fulfilled the promise I had made to Dan. I was nearly in tears at the gym, by myself, at the squat rack. 

It is the memory and life of my lost friend that I do anything anymore. I knew I had to get up and start living because, at any moment, you could have your life taken from you. He embraced life and ran with it. I cannot tell you how much I miss the kid. It still bothers me months later, but I am stronger because of it. 

I can honestly say I am happy and healthy again. I changed my routine and I go 5 days a week now. My legs are actually MUCH stronger now than they were before my snowboarding accident. I made a promise to myself to live the absolute fullest life I could, because I know that was what Dan would have done.

R.I.P. Dan, you were the best of us.

**TL;DR- I broke my leg snowboarding after wanting to get in shape, took about a year to rebuild the strength back, met my new best friend, and started lifting and getting into the best shape of my life. In November, my friend passed away. His death taught me I could not sit around and just wait for death. I needed to start living. I promised him I would rep 175 lbs. on my squat, and about a month after he passed, I did it.**

Sorry for such a massive text wall, I tried to make it as easy to follow as possible.

qjlx9,5,2012-03-05,A friend's letter to a College Professor..,Vulgotha,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/qjlx9/a_friends_letter_to_a_college_professor/,"I'm new here, but this struck me as the sort of thing Reddit would appreciate. I've been lurking here for a bit, however. 

This is from a very close friend of mine (who I would aptly describe as being a superior specimen of humanity)  to an English Professor at a particular large college in Nebraska. 

I simply had to post this:

""You've made good points and I appreciate your honesty. I try not to be a selfish, egoistic or a merciless person, if I have erred then I have erred. The fact that your willing to tell me how, more or less resolves the issue. Had you not been as definite with me, I would have pushed this further.

The reason for absence to your class specifically was the I worked from 10pm to 6am then would try to sleep as short as possible in order to see a girl between waking and going to your class. I could only see her at that time, because her Parents are fanatic evangelicals and since she contracted a heart illness about 9 months back, they put a prohibition on her seeing me because they are afraid she is going to die and go to hell or something for being with a 'non-believer'. So I had to sneak in during the two days when her Mom wasn't home. Unfortunately I would sometimes fall asleep there, or often she would beg me to stay as we hardly got to see each other. At the end of the day, I had far more passion for being with her, than being in your class. That put the strain on my attendance in your class, so I hope you don't take it personally that I wasn't there, nor that I told you I was 'sick', as I don't really think telling you I was sneaking into an evangelical home to see a fatefully ill ex-girlfriend with religious extremist parents would have been appropriate or believable at the time. So I'm glad you cut me slack on the attendance policy because it was a bit complicated. Even without that aspect however, my attendance would have been lacking. 

The problem is I hate University but I love learning. I hate University exactly for some of the reasons you have stated why my grade was a confusing choice. University favors bureaucracy not industry, it seems more often than not that Professors desire obedience rather than merit, or rather that obedience is confused for merit.  In many classes there are those who work very hard but lack talent, and often they are favored in grading because they have put in so much effort over someone whose raw ability is better, even though their outcome is lesser. The objective always seems muddled to me, is the purpose of a class to improve your basic skill set or to execute the highest degree of dominance over a skill-set regardless of improvement? Is the purpose to 'try hardest' or to 'execute most successfully'?

I have faced this conundrum several times, and luckily I have gotten better at playing the game, but I've never respected it. Perhaps the worst example, was a 3000 level Spanish class I leap-frogged into at my last University, mind you I am a native speaker of Spanish. I recall reading the papers of my 'editing partner' and being unable to understand this caveman imitation of Iberia's most important language. At the end of it however, she got an A and I got a C, despite the vast disparity in the quality of our work. Upon asking the Teacher why, the reasons stated were attendance and that I would just 'turn in assignments' without submitting prior 'outlines' and 'vocabulary search' along with them. At that time I was more detached and cared less, I simply stated to her 'why do I need such things if the point of the class writing papers not doing vocabulary crosswords.' This obviously didn't go well.

I've seen some justice though, I had a Biology professor that refused to accept a research paper from me because the binder was 'unaesthetic' and according to him ""It was clearly stated that an aesthetic cover was part of the assignment.""  I told him plainly that I'm not a 13 year old girl with glue stick and glitter, the point of this class is Biology not getting an art badge in Brownie Scouts. The Teacher disliked me from long before, he confused my dispassion for arrogance and my detachment as an insult. I took it to the Dean, and he found that the Teacher's actions bordered on harassment. In the end, my grade was reversed from a D to an A, mostly because I got the highest grade in the class on the Final.  Ironically, at UNO they didn't accept this Biology credit transfer.

Some might say these 'details' are well founded in industry and that doing an outline has an equivalent in industry. Perhaps, just as when you write a program you need to have supporting documentation. It's not entirely the same thing though, an outline is a supplement to aid in a result but it is a supplement no less, not the core of a project, while documentation is necessary for successful management of a program. If the capricious frivolities in academia do mimic any type of industry, they mimic corporations in over-regulated vertically-oppressed quixotic nations such as the one I am in right now. Here you have to get the social security number of every person you make a sale to,  taxes start a 37% and there is a permit for anything you want to do. Otherwise the police come and throw you in jail for the societal equivalent of academic insubordination. However, these laws only apply to those who are successful enough to launch an enterprise by the book, for the rest of the 80% of the population who try 'really hard', the Government turns a blind eye to their black-market and gives them hand-outs taken from the taxes of the more successful. The reflects quite aptly the situation of intention over result present in academia at large, most commonly found in the Humanities, where the 'details' are largely capriciously invented by Teachers, while in the Sciences they are axioms determined by nature herself.

It's exactly for these reasons, I'm about a hair strand from just quitting college and focusing 150% on getting a job in my field and launching an enterprise. Why should I pay money for a bureaucratic beating? Why should I be chastised for not wanting to participate in class discussions with people who I otherwise wouldn't even speak to otherwise? Do I really gain anything of value from listening to a person so bereft of critical thinking that they give a presentation on why it is 'Christian' to support the 'death penalty' or when I'm forced to write papers supporting social agendas which I thoroughly oppose?  I get nothing from it, just debt, frustration and lost time.

You state that my grade fell to a B due not to attendance but to mere lack of achievement in the 'details' of assignments in which I got A's in. I see reason in that, and I have no reason to believe you docked me points on those assignments simply for absences. I respect that I did not get the points on those assignments and had I not been at Carnaval and then my internship here in Bolivia, I would have conferenced with you before the end of class to have dealt with it. That was my responsibility.

The question however, is do those missed assignments reflect didactism, or are they simply the defects of the sub-conscious impulse to control?  Does the fact that an annotated bibliography lacks 'similarity' clauses change the fact that the paper it was meant to support was well-researched enough to get an A? Does the fact that there was no idea outline drawing, change the fact that a well-organized nebula of ideas did exist in the paper? Was the purpose was to use the crutches that aid in writing in a good paper, or actually write a solid paper? Was the purpose consequence or intention? As far as I can see, you gave me points for 'doing' but docked me points for 'not trying'...to me that is the definition of cognitive dissonance. 

Ultimately, only you know the answer to these questions. At large, it is this sort of introspection that will have to take place before the academic system can cease to decay in the way it has been. In the way that has made me so estranged to it."""

qjl9r,4,2012-03-05,My Homebrewing Setup,trthomps,Homebrewing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/qjl9r/my_homebrewing_setup/,"https://picasaweb.google.com/halofreak909/HomebrewSetup?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCN_ni9jIv5HbCA&amp;feat=directlink

I'll explain each of the pictures and the general brewing process in case people are curious.  First off, the metal sculpture plugged into our gas line is a three tier brew sculpture.  It holds both of the kegs as well as the cooler, allowing us to use gravity, rather than pumps or plain old human strength to transfer liquids in between brewing steps.  The first step is to set the hot water tank (this is the keg with the thermometer and clear tube running up the side) on the top most shelf of the brew sculpture and fill it with water.  Once this water is at an appropriate temperature (around 175 degrees Farenheit), it is added to the grain sitting in the mash tun (the cooler).  Once the colder  grains are mixed with the hot water, the temperature of the mixture drops to between 150-160 degrees.  The reason we run the mash in a cooler is to hold grain and water at a constant temperature so that enzymes in the mash (the grain water mixture) can convert long chained starches to short chained sugars.  This process lasts about an hour, after which the sweet, sugary water from the mash gets drained into the boil kettle. After boiling for 60 minutes with hops, the sugary liquid is cooled down and yeast is pitched.  The copper tube inside the keg allows the liquid from the kegs to be drained all the way to the bottom instead of stopping where the spigots are.

As you can see, the whole set-up was pretty damn cheap.  The welding was done by my college housemate using scrap metal and cost less than $30.  The burners on the brew sculpture were bought online for less than $25 each.  Gas line and tubing was another $40 or so.  The kegs were the most expensive part, each were bought on craigslist for $70 a piece.  I can't remember how much the cooler cost, but since most people can find one sitting around for free anyways, it's not too significant.  The spigots were bought on bargainfittings.com, and cost around $65 including the thermometer and sight tube.

My favorite part about this setup is that it runs on natural gas; cheaper than propane, never needs to be replaced/refilled, and can't run out in the middle of a brew session.  As far as critiques, the brew stand could have been built with pegs to hold the kegs up, rather than welding those bulky and complex hexagon stands.  Also, our burners let out about 5 times as much BTUs as we need.  This is really nice for heating just water up, but it's tough to get a good heat level on the boil.

We do 10 gallon batches with this set-up and with bulk grain and hops, I can make a 7% IPA for about $35 before utilities.  That's about 100 beers.  We don't sell much of our beer unless a friend wants to take a six pack home or something like that.  We keg about half of our stuff and bottle the other half.  We're constantly bottling beer in fermenters and filling those fermenters up so that they never stay empty for more than a week.  Right now, I have 20 gallons of beer in fermenters, 5 gallons kegged and about 150 12oz bottles.  Living with semi-alcoholic college students (oxymoron?) does wonders in making all this beer go away.

I got a short internship at a microbrewery in San Diego and now I can hardly stand to brew on my ghetto set-up, but I'm still very proud of it."

Now, my recovery has been a slow process—the broken bones healed, but there are still episodes of confusion I have, that are associated with the brain injury. And the migraines don’t get me started on them. 

When I began thinking about the accident, and the trauma that had induced it, I began to believe I had presented myself with a valid, tangible way of explaining the things that had been happening to me. I even went as far as, on that Monday morning, sitting down at my desk with a pad and paper over lunch break and making a list of all of the strange experiences I’d had in the past three years since the accident.  What I came up with centered mainly around the first year after the accident. Several things I’d been experiencing bore a striking resemblance to what I was now experiencing.

It wasn’t as if I didn’t know about the side effects of brain trauma, and I don’t find myself particularly given to fancy, however… the things I saw that first year, mostly in dreams, disturbed me. My sleep patterns were highly irregular for months after the accident—sometimes I would not be able to sleep for days on end; I just had no desire to. I’d estimate that it was about six months after the accident that my sleep had evened out, and, coincidentally, when my dreams had gotten a bit more concerning. With more sleep came more dreams, and with more dreams came some interesting, albeit frightening, occurrences. At this time, Jen and I were experiencing a rough patch; she had been offered an internship upstate, and was planning her move, while I was grounded where we’d been living for two years together. 

We never imagine the ease with which some people can sever others from their lives; but they can and they do. Long story relatively short, Jen took the internship. In all honesty, the choppiness of my sleep schedule and my irritability following the injury probably had had a great deal to do with all of it, as well. She and I had tried the long-distance thing for a while, but the time and the money eluded us, and soon the contact had trickled to a halt. I’ve been a lone wolf, so to speak, since then.

Getting back to business… due to the lack of sleep, I believe, anyhow, there were these… hallucinations. They started small, things in my peripheral vision, dark spots, shadows on the wall, the cliché stuff of any ghost story. They seemed sleep-related to begin with, they correlated to the amount of sleep—if any—I was getting, and it seemed that the closer I got to a regular sleep schedule, the less frequent they’d become.  First, though, I should explain the dreams.

I’d see a person, in my dreams. It was always a tall, large figure, and he or she was always faceless. I got the impression that it was a masculine presence, however. Explaining “how” I knew that never makes sense, even to me, so I will not even attempt it here. Essentially, this figure would be in nearly all of my dreams, and he looked and felt like the presence of those faceless people I’d imagined after being hit. It wouldn’t matter what the dream was, necessarily, either—it could be a silly thing like a family reunion or bungee jumping—he’d still usually make an appearance. He never interacted with me, just merely stood and watched. It got to the point, for a while, that when he didn’t show up in my dreams, I was unnerved. Thankfully, those dreams lessened quite a bit, to the point that, presently, I rarely ever dream of him.

Like I mentioned before, it was about this time that the hallucinations began, full swing. They began in dreams—much like what I’d experienced with Eric. I’d see an image in my dream, and it would carry over into waking life. Sometimes I’d see it right as I woke, but other times it would appear at random during the day. One of the most memorable of these hallucinations occurred while I was at work. I had just begun the job I have now, in the university’s counseling office. It began with me, at work, just sitting at my desk, between appointments. I usually had fifteen or twenty minutes between them to check over the next kid’s paperwork or organize things. Well, I was sitting there, just having awoken from dozing off at my desk for a few minutes, and I felt as if I was being watched. I don’t have to elaborate on that feeling—we all have been there. Now, my office is small; it’s only about ten feet by eight, and there’s not much hiding room. It also has no window. I was feeling a presence, and paranoia set in—feeling as if you are being watched in a space as small as that is one of the most unnerving feelings in the world, I believe. 

Feeling like a goofy, superstitious idiot, I checked everywhere in the small office. I looked under my desk, behind my small filing cabinet. Of course, there was nothing there. Had I expected there to be? I took a seat back in my armchair, waiting for the next patient and checking the clock on the wall every thirty seconds or so. I contemplated opening my door and going into the waiting room, but I had just begun working there, and did not want to appear unprofessional and nervous. I decided to stick it out. 

I heard a noise. It was a scuffle, sounded like a footstep against the carpet in my office. Needless to say, I was frozen, eyes glued to my office door. I began reciting to myself, as I’d done since the accident, “This is not reality. You are not hearing or seeing anything; your mind is playing tricks on you. Remember your mind is playing tricks on you.” Generally, this mantra, paired with a calm demeanor, would eventually allow the feeling of dread to pass. This time, though, I felt something touch me. It was like a hand on my shoulder for a split second, and then it was gone. Just as I mustered the courage to reach up to feel for something behind me, my office door opened, nearly causing me to soil myself. The look on my face must’ve been priceless. The receptionist was letting me know my client was ready to see me. I told her to show him in, but that I wasn’t feeling well and might need the rest of the day off. 

Now, since this incident, there hadn’t been anything major. Just a few odd dreams and some fragmented paranoia once in a while. Sitting in my office chair the Monday after seeing Eric’s imagined image in my dreams, it seemed that these incidences had a lot in common. Really, at this point, I was worried for my neurological health; the doctor had warned me that there could be side-effects like the dreams, or like the hallucinations. He also told me to keep track of them, and report them to him every six months we had an appointment, just to make sure nothing more serious was going on in there. Well, it had been so long since one of the more full-fledged hallucinations, that I was beginning to worry it might be a sign of something much more serious than a bout of sleep paralysis. 

As I sat making that list of episodes, I resigned to calling my neurologist and seeing how soon I could get in for an appointment. I spoke on the phone with his nurse, and she assured me that what I was experiencing seemed to be, indeed, related to the injury, and to try not to worry. I was able to schedule one for the next week, early, which gave me much-needed peace-of-mind. 

*I'll stop here, for now. It's been a long day, and I have some work to finish with. I will update you very soon, though, if you're interested. I am thoroughly surprised at the response, you guys are great; there is peace-of-mind in sharing this with ya'll.* "

qjg12,2,2012-03-05,"Long ass, frustrated, depressed rant",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/qjg12/long_ass_frustrated_depressed_rant/,"This is going to be more of a rant than anything. I've posted it on my blog before, though that was a few years ago and I've been feeling even worse since then.

Let me start by saying I haven't had the best childhood in the world. Yes, there are kids who have had worse, but the things I went through on a daily basis hurt more than anything and left a good sized scar on my head: http://imgur.com/Vjubt

I moved from Canada to the States and things became even more miserable for me. My parents, particularly mom, held very high expectations of me in terms of school. When I didn't follow through, meaning bring back straight A's, well, I felt that instant death would have been a better option than going home. This went on until I was 18 and went on to college. I had a group of friends at the time, and they knew what was going on and offered to help (though it was merely talk). It got to the point where a couple of my teachers knew and would sympathize by offering more extra credit, though it was too late because I got calls right after school and lying yielded a night in hell. On top of that, there were people in school talking about me behind my back, for reasons I'll never know. I was always quiet and never said anything about anyone, nor did I do anything offensive. Because of the shit I went through at home, I nearly committed suicide in the 10th grade (wrote a note to someone, and they told the counselors) and again later that year. I wasn't afraid of going through with it, and some days, it makes me wish I did (but I won't).

My mom always said I would never succeed, and that I would end up a janitor or garbage man - simply because I struggled with tests. My dad never really gave a fuck about me or wanted anything to do with me. He always favored my little brother. Well, I ended up getting into a good college, but only lasted a year there. I'm not ashamed to say I flunked out of that school for my first year. I wasn't ready for it. I never was smart either, merely average at best. Then, to make it worse, my 'friends,'  I figured people would change, but to the extent they isolated me really brought me down.

At this point, I had never been in a relationship in my life, nor had I enjoyed any sort of success or happiness. I only had these 3 guys who I thought were my friends, who I thought I could trust, who I thought would be there for me. I came back home and went to the local community college and decided to get my shit straight, finish school, land a job and maybe things would turn around. Well, I finished up at the CC and transferred to a university and cranked out an AS and BS in 2 years. My internship developed into a permanent job, and things were going great. I thought I was finally getting the break I wanted. Not really.

Since I lived at home, I was constantly getting berated by my parents, constantly cursed, put down, and so forth. Sure, it doesn't sound all that bad, but when it's a daily occurrence, it affects you mentally. Having no friends on top of that, nor anywhere to escape to in this shitty town, I just had to live with it. I tried to get in contact with my high school friends, but I guess they were all too busy to talk to me, but certainly not too busy to bum around on Facebook. But what's this? You message me for help on your programming homework? Rather, begging for help? Fuck you. 

My situation now: I still don't have a girlfriend nor any friends. Anyone I met during the time I came back until now just ended up as Facebook friends. Oh yeah, we'll hang out next week. No phone call, no reply to my texts, or better yet - 'I can't make it, I'm busy.' Meanwhile on Facebook... 'bored...hmu.' Fuck you.

I simply don't get it. I know I'm not the most attractive guy in the world, but I'm certainly above average. Sure, I may be a little shy, but I have clean hygiene, athletic, graduated a year earlier than my peers and have a stable job...at 21, and I have plans to start a charity organization in 5 years - not to mention I proved my parents wrong and now work in IT security for a great company. Nobody else I know can say the same. I busted my ass for success, and I got it. But I still don't have happiness, still no real friends, still no girlfriend. Still no reason for me to be happy about a god damn fucking thing. It's almost like people don't want to associate themselves with me. 

Why? What's wrong with me? I'm not a tool-bag, I treat people with respect when I meet them. I'm not a racist, sexist, homophobic, or anything of the sort. It's frustrating, really, and leaves me with little to do. I've gone to bars, clubs, etc to try and meet people, but it seems that unless I'm drunk, I'm not really wanted there. This is just so irritating and depressing for me. I have nothing else to do when I come home after work other than exercise, eat dinner, and sleep. 

I feel like I'm starting to lose my sanity, starting to be pissed off all the time at home for no reason. I'm only living at home now because I'm helping my parents clear off some debt, but I'm moving out at the end of the year, and if things don't change, then FUCK. Just over the past few years, I've been getting angry for no reason. I don't show it, but it's there and I just want to bash my head against the wall until I pass out. Hell, I even went out and bought a new car 3 weeks ago out of frustration and loneliness, and every morning I just want to fucking go full boost in every gear, smash the gas and clutch, and tear up the roads. The moment I get in that car, it's almost like I freak out, knowing that I bought the thing because I don't have anything else in life that makes me happy. It just fucking sucks.

It may seem like the things I went through years ago don't sound bad, but I left out all the details of what happened. I went to school nearly everyday with swollen and red skin, and nobody gave a fuck. None of what I said may make any sense, I'm just beyond pissed, tired, depressed, and frustrated today and needed to let it out. I'm depressed and angry most of the time and I just don't know what to do anymore. "

The careers services at my school sent my resume to the bank, hence I have no idea what they mean by ""coverage group"". I assumed that they meant Industry coverage and not product coverage.
Additionally, do you have any idea how I can prepare for a coverage group interview specifically? I'm guessing I have to get up to date on my valuation skills etc.
Thanks a lot, I appreciate all your help."
qmb7o,3,2012-03-07,Life and the unexpected turns of its wheel,YourDirtySlut,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/qmb7o/life_and_the_unexpected_turns_of_its_wheel/,"Before 2010, life for me was the usual suck of someone in their early 20's.  Crappy job, still in school, struggling constantly to make the bills.  Single, horny, and trying to make the best of things.  Every day had been a struggle since I was 15 and first diagnosed with depression and anxiety- like a never ending case of pessimism that I couldn't win again.

Then Aug 2010, I was nearly killed in a head on collision.  Lets just say it COMPLETELY fucked up my life for a whole year.  And not the good way.  My leg and arm were fucked up, so I was in a wheelchair for 2 months.  i couldn't wash myself, cut my own meat, or hell, make a quick run to the bathroom, it took me 15min to finally get up and go take a piss!  I lost my awesome place living with my best friend for cheap rent because I lived in the upstairs.  After 2 months in the wheelchair, I graduated to 2 months on a granny walker with an arm rest.  Fuck going into public with THAT, so i continued with the wheelchair.  Oh yes, I forgot to mention that the car crash happened 2 weeks before the new semester began, and I had surgery a week before.  So I had to deal with tests, homework, physical therapy, occupational therapy, lawyers, and learning how to get around on my own.  I fell once in the parking lot trying to get the wheelchair in my car by myself.  People waited until I fell to help me.

Also during this time, I became very depressed, no matter how stoned I was on pain pills.  You realize who your true friends are in situations like this.  I basically realized I only had 2 good friends and a loyal boyfriend.  It devastated me.  People were willing to say ""get well soon!"" but not come visit me during the 4 months I was pretty much trapped in my parents' basement.

Following my physical recovery, I developed even worse anxiety and depression.  I became the psycho needy girlfriend who NO ONE likes.  And after 3 years, I had to be put back on medication just to be able to deal with the crap that was my life.  Once my medication got stabilized, and I felt normal, I realized I was in an abusive relationship.  My (now ex) boyfriend made regular comments about my weight and even told me I was fat a few days before valentines day.  I had put 10lb on while I was in the wheelchair.  And as soon as I started walking again, he expected me to go out and lose weight on my own while he stayed in doors and watched video games.

Then things began to change.  I finally left my boyfriend after he fucked me over yet another time, and ended up with this GORGEOUS guy (like way out of my league gorgeous) who thought I was just stunning and perfect the way I was.  So I started working out, because it was a different sort of motivation.

Shortly after I met him, I FINALLY got the settlement I had waited a year and a half for.  During the wait I had planned, planned, planned, and been stuck with the frustrating hope.  Now I got to make all my dreams come true :)

My folks finally caved and let me finally get a dog, so I got a $3,000 puppy (blue and white olde english bulldogge) on Christmas and she has been the light of my life.  This Saturday my parents, best friend (one of the 2 who was actually there for me after the crash), and I are leaving for a cruise.  I paid for their plane tickets and rooms on the ship for a week long cruise in the western carribean as a thank you for being there for me.  I got a new car- until now i had always driven pieces of shit that required constant monitoring so I didn't blow up.  I redid my bedroom at my parents' so I could stop sleeping in a bunkbed, lol.  I got a new wardrobe so i didn't have to keep wearing clothes from middle school (I'm 25).  And this summer I am taking an adventure of a lifetime!  

Before the crash I would have never even considered it, but this late May I am leaving for California to do a 3 month internship.  And me and the pooch are driving (from Minnesota).  I've never been past the dakotas western wise, so I am going to make as many stops as possible.  I get to finally see the grand canyon :)  It will just be me and the dog, doing whatever the hell we want, and capturing it all with my camera.

So, I guess, just remember.  No matter how shitty things can get, and they can get really fucking shitty, they always get better.  My arm and ankle will never be the same, I'll never play softball or run a marathon, but there are other things I CAN say I got to do :)

TL;DR- Almost died in car wreck, life really hit rock bottom, now it's at its peak a year and a half later."

Since it is marketing, I was going to try and make some sample ads. Except I don't have a camera, models, a studio, etc, so any ads I whip up will have to be drawn on the computer.

I have a Macbook Pro that runs Lion and Windows 7. I think I need some vector drawing software? Which one's the best? Is it possible to take stock photos and edit them to fit my design, so it looks photographic and realistic, and not something I drew?

Basically I'd like my samples to turn out something like this: http://media02.hongkiat.com/creative-ads/glassex-cleaner.jpg

What do I do?,Osupda,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qlztw/one_small_company_wants_to_hire_me_but_i_have_an/,"This is my first question on Reddit, and I really need some advice. I graduated last year with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, and I've been living at home ever since, working a part-time job in town. During the summer I applied to several full-time jobs, one of which for a big, very well-known company (can't say who it is). After months of no luck I decided to take up an internship in September and put job searching on hold so I gain some applicable experience and improve my chances of getting hired.

In early January, I was told by my parents that it would have to end soon because our car would be needed for my dad's work and I would have no transportation (there is public transportation, but it would mean getting up at 5AM for a 2-hour commute). Until the internship ended I applied to several other jobs, one of which is a start-up company located right in town. This particular one was on Craigslist and shortly after I applied, the posting was removed and I did not hear back for several weeks.

In early February, the big company from the summer responded back by saying they wanted to schedule a phone screening with me (as well as an undefined number of others). I did great on the initial screening and on the second one as well. In late February they scheduled me for an in-person interview, which is two weeks from today, and I am very excited for it.

This is where it gets complicated. A few days ago, the small company from the Craigslist posting finally responded back and asked if I was still available and interested for a part-time position, which would eventually grow. I was advised to reply ""yes"" and not mention the upcoming interview, because it's likely to be a deal breaker even though an interview does not necessarily mean I'm unavailable. Yesterday I had one 10-minute interview with the small company, and they want me to come in a few days from now and start initial training.

I don't know what to do now. I'm afraid that telling them about the upcoming interview might ruin everything: if the upcoming interview does not yield the full-time position, then I could also lose the opportunity for a position I would have received otherwise.

I really need some advice. How should I handle this mess?"
qluvu,4,2012-03-07,Interested in ling graduate school but not sure if I'm qualified...,kvd171,linguistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/qluvu/interested_in_ling_graduate_school_but_not_sure/,"Hi there r/linguistics.  I finished my undergrad in 2010 with two degrees--a BA in Spanish and a BBA (mgmt).  I loved my linguistics classes (in English and Spanish) in college and if I would have taken LING classes in my first couple years I would have majored in it.

I had no plans for grad school due to already excessive student loans, but I got a job working for a major University and the tuition benefits are excellent so I've been considering continuing my studies.

Does someone like me who has interest in linguistics but very little academic background (3-4 classes in my UG, in which I did very well) have a chance at grad school?  And more importantly, what do you recommend I do to help my chances in the meantime?  

I guess I'll need to start preparing for the GRE but is there anything I can do to strengthen my ling skill set since I won't be coming straight out of Undergrad?  Is my situation common?

I work full time so taking on an internship or something similar would be a stretch, and listing ""subscribed to r/linguistics"" on a grad school application probably won't help much. :)

I guess one final and more broad question is this: Do most people have a linguistic concentration/focus decided before entering grad school?  I know there are plenty of specialties in the ling world but I have yet to find one that I feel ready to primarily pursue.  What are some of you guys studying who are in graduate school?

Thanks for your patience for reading my post and I look forward to hearing back from you all. :)"

qlrze,1,2012-03-07,Career Question - Civil / Envir Engineer,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/qlrze/career_question_civil_envir_engineer/,"I've come to a crossroads in my career and was hoping to get some insight from the folks here.  Sorry if this is a bit long, but I want to give as much background as possible.  I've included a TLDR at the bottom.

I'm a mid 20's civil/env engineering grad, already passed the FE and sit for my PE this October.  I've spent the past 6 years at the same firm (2 yrs as an intern and 4 yrs full-time).  The company I work for is rather successful and employees slightly less than 1000 people.  When I first started here full-time I loved it and looked forward to work everyday.  Things have changed recently though and that's where my questions come up.

My office (15-20 people) has one sole client.  This has its benefits and downfalls.  We're rarely short on work or worried about how much we bill to a specific project, but I'm also lacking experience.  I've never prepared a formal bid and don't know how to go about going out and getting my own work.  Plus, our main clients work will be slowly diminishing over the next 10 years.  I personally think it's better to jump ship sooner rather than later.  I don't want to be a mid/late 30's PE with limited experience on certain obvious tasks trying to find a new job.  I rather switch jobs now and get the necessary experience while I'm still rather young and expected to be rather green in some areas.  I brought up these concerns to my office manager during my review this year.  He agreed with me on the diminishing work and stated he would try to get me more experience in the other aspects I'm lacking, but these promises have been made and broken before.  Even with me bringing them up throughout the year.

A second point of contention is my salary.  I've received a raise every year, but I know my raise has not been on par with others in my office.  This would be OK with me if I wasn't one of the top employees in my office.  For example, I've gotten a 2.5% increase the past 2 years and a 5.5% raise 3 years ago with a promotion.  During those same years someone who earns roughly $15k-$20k more a year than me, with less technical and social (read: client) skills has received nearly 5% every year.  It's not just this one person either.  Of the ~15 people in my office I would say about 10-12 of them receive better raises than me.  My reviews have gone extremely well where I get praise for my work ethic, technical/problem solving skills and am told it's a pleasure to have me around.  I haven't brought up these concerns to my office manager for two reasons.  First being I wanted to wait till I have my PE before complaining about my salary and secondly because I can't really bring up the fact that people talk and we all know how much each other is making and getting in raises.


**TLDR:** Mid 20s Civil/Envir Engineer.  Taking PE this October.  Concerned about lack of experience in certain aspects and feels slighted by lack of compensation when compared to others in my office.  Considering switching jobs.

My questions are: 

1) Are my problems/complaints legitimate or are am I someone who feels entitled to something that I really have no claim to?

2) Would you recommend switching jobs right before taking your PE?  Should I just ride this out till I get my PE results and see how things go than go from there?"

I will start with mine.,the_phet,soccer,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/qllmo/explain_your_worst_week_being_a_fan_of_your_club/,"I just wrote this in [/r/barca](/r/barca) and I spent some time searching for the data so I have decided to share this with you also. I am doing a text entry, so I am not getting any karma. Just to share some football stories from the old days.

I am a Barça fan, so I will start with one image: http://i.imgur.com/Awivc.png

And then the explanation:

I remember that week as my worse experience as a Barça fan. Most fans nowadays are just having a great time with the Rijkaard - Guardiola era. Before that Barça was a roller coaster of emotions.

That week was in Feb of 2003. Barça lost before against Celta 2-0 and Van Gaal was sacked. Then we had an intern coach who lost 3-0 against Atlético de Madrid. Then we hired Antic and tied 2-2 against Bilbao at home.

That year was the 4th in a row without winning anything. Every year we were losing some talented players. We were not title contenders anymore and at the start of the season we only wanted to go for CL. That season was being awful.

That week we played against Espanyol who at that time was 18th with 22 points. Barça was 15th with 24 points. We played in their stadium, it was very very likely that we would lose. If Osasuna and Racing managed to win their game, Barça would sleep one week in second division.

Racing played against Rayo, it was an ""easy"" game for Racing because Rayo was 19th. Racing won.

Osasuna played against Real Madrid (Madrid was 2nd at that moment, the leader was Real Sociedad). First and only time I went with Madrid to save my team from second division. The incredible happened and Osasuna won. The history said that Madrid players let Osasuna win to see Barça in second division.

At that point Barça was 17th and Espanyol 18th (with 1 game less both teams). The pressure from the Madrid media was incredible. It was like Barça was already in second division. They were explaining how a team that goes downhill is doomed. The game was in Espanyol's stadium. If they win, we are in second division. Somehow Barça won that game. We saved our asses and finished 6th. Later came Rijkaard and later Pep Guardiola, but that's another story.

I feel sad for my parents, who worked so hard to help get me through school, who are always talking with parents boasting about how great their kid is doing or something and how embarrassed they must be time and time again to repeat the same thing on how i'm still jobless doing nothing.

I'm just not sure how to respond.

&gt;I had a thought the other day regarding your FAFSA and a summer internship.
&gt;
&gt;First of all I'm glad you're enjoying your college experience, but I'll be honest I'm concerned with your marijuana use.  I hope you realize the drug testing will show that for up to 9 months.  The days of blood testing is done, now many of the businesses use hair testing that can detect drug use for up to 9 months prior.  Your potential employer doesn't care if you have a beer or two but they do care if you're using drugs, even if you have a medical card.  An acquaintance of mine lost a job because of drug testing and marijuana use, even with a medical card. It may not have been right, but they can do what they want.
&gt; 
&gt;I'll be honest I am concerned about your drinking and your drug use.  Once to try it is quite different than your on-going use. 
&gt; 
&gt;If by chance you are cited for possession(and I know you say they're not going to cite you for possession) and I'm also concerned about your having alcohol in your house, especially if you're the only one who will be over 21 in your new house.) If your friend who was hit on the skateboard was under 21 and coming from a party at your house you could be cited for providing alcohol to minors even if you didn't actually purchase it. Turnig 21 has it's advantages and disadvantages.
&gt; 
&gt;Last but not least, your FAFSA payments will be canceled if you are found guilty of possession.  It was stated right there when I hit the submit button.
&gt; 
&gt;Dubeskin, I am concerned about your addictive nature (you know you have a tendency to addiction- look at your Pokemon card collection!) A beer now and then is different from binge drinking, drinking every weekend and marijuana use. 
&gt;
&gt;Take this as a concerned parent who loves you very much and wants you healthy and safe.

Any suggestions? I could completely blow it off, or I could go back through and address everything on a point-by-point basis. I'm sorry to ask you guys, and to be honest it feels entirely juvenile in itself to ask for advice on the internet on this topic, but I'm just seeking a way to sort of reconcile this with my family, because in the end, they're going to be there for me before any drug ever will.

I'm an intern with this filming crew who cover Florida legislature. For the past few months I only filmed subcommittees and what not, and one time last week I had to bring a tape to one of the other guys who was covering the senate session. I was sitting there talking with the guy a little bit before it started, and right after they finished calling roll they called up the senate priest. He aced for everyone to bow their heads and he then proceeded to pray, and every senator and media person there did it. I know this because I was the only one who didn't. I asked the guy I was giving the tape to why they were praying and he had no idea.


Does anyone know why this is happening? I mean you guys understand why I'm confused, right? Is this only Florida, or does this happen in other states or congress? "

I've got 2 versions of my resume.  Previously, I did not have a section on employment history.  But I just got my first job doing IT at a high school (hopefully a temporary job until I find an engineering job).

I thought I might want to use the principal there as a reference, so I figured I better add it to my resume, despite that it is not that impressive.  So I cut a couple things to make room for an employment history section.  I could add the employment history without cutting anything, but it would be more than 1 page.  How does r/resumes feel about multi-page resumes?

I went to a good school, but my biggest weakness is my GPA, which is only 3.0.  So I left that off.  Some employers still make you enter it when you apply online though.  My other big weakness is my lack of an internship.

Resume 1, no employment history:

I decided to enlist in the Marine Corps in 2006, and I loved every minute of it. It literally turned my life around... I used to do absolutely nothing, most of every day. I really hated myself, and I tried to make sure everyone around me suffered as well. 
I enlisted out of a last-ditch effort to change things in my life... and I'm the first one to admit I enlisted at the right time. It was 2006, so the housing boom created great incentives for anyone joining the military, so I got a 10k Bonus once I completed RIP. But I got out in 2010, and decided to use the new GI Bill to go back to school. I'm at NYU, and I literally CANNOT GIVE MY WORK AWAY. I will interview with companies, and tell them straightforward that because of the GI Bill and all that it's given me, I am willing to work for them for free, just to gain civilian work experience, I can be classified as an 'unpaid intern'. I am 27. This isn't a pride issue, because I am literally trying to give my labor away for FREE. But most companies tell me I am either a)too old, or b)not a 'cultural fit' for their junior member employment pool. I understand that it's difficult to imagine someone who wants to work full time while they are going to school, but you have to imagine what kind of environment I am coming from. I am used to working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for months at a time. I have spent my life identifying who I am as what I do. When I don't have a purpose, I feel like I'm worthless. I try and keep this desperation from my interviews, but it is difficult to play hard to get when I so desperately want to work, and validate my identity. I understand that the job market in NYC is oversaturated with qualified graduates, and degrees that go unused. But To tell me that I can't shovel dirt at a construction site for minimum wage because I have too much experience fucking kills me. Combat Vets aren't the poisoned candy that the media leads you to believe we are. We are, and I believe I can generalize here, hard working, loyal, and above all we fucking love to accomplish things.

There is a downside though. It's located in Glendale, CA and I am in Northeast Indiana. It's also unpaid...and I would have to leave my pretty amazing job for a couple months.

And I just don't know what I'm going to do. They did also offer me a remote internship (Which I know is the most practical.) But I feel like I would be losing so much experience. But there is no way I can afford the rent out there. I've looked at different apartment/roomshares/sublets and everything is more than double what my rent is here. I've tried talking to my parents about it, but they are all, ""Why don't you get an internship at one of the companies in town or close by.""

But I want to get away from here (Not that it's bad, but it's just not me. There is no place for me to grow.) So what's a girl to do? Do I just suck it up and take the remote internship? Do I wait a week or so to see if I get a response for any other internships? Do I just save up for the plane ticket and hope that I find a cardboard box on the street?

I'm a graduate student in journalism who will be interning in Reykjavik over the summer, and have a few questions concerning the city, culture and people there. Obviously I've read a lot online but Wikipedia can only go so far. 

First off (and most importantly): what's the bar scene like there? What can I expect to pay (in US dollars or Icelandic krónur) for a beer? A martini? Where can I go to get sufficiently inebriated but not pay top-dollar for my libations? Conversely, where are some unique, out-of-the-ordinary bars that I must absolutely see in my three-month stint in Reykjavik? 

Secondly (and probably what I should most be worried about): Where can I find reasonable living there?? I'll be in Reykjavik for three months so I need to find somewhere to stay. My internship gives me 20 000 ISK/month, so I don't have a lot of money to work with (obviously I will have to pay the difference in what my apartment is, but I'm hoping to keep these costs as low as possible). I would like to live somewhere in or around the 101, 105 or 107 as I won't have a car and will need to walk to and from work each day. 

Thirdly: Help me avoid tourist traps. There are some things I am going to see any way where I can't help this (the Blue Lagoon, Gullfoss, Geysir), but I want to know some other places that are beautiful and what about it. 

Lastly: What can I expect weather-wise from May 15-Aug. 15? Some sites say it will be really warm, others say it can be as cold as 0 C in the day. 

Thanks in advance r/Iceland! I have to go to class and work for many hours but I will check on this when I come back! "

I'm finding that almost none of the public accounting firms in my area are listing entry-level or internships for tax.

Majoring in CS, focusing in computer systems and minoring in math. I was at a university career fair, and when talking to many of the employers, many of them asked me 'so what do you enjoy more, hardware or software?' and I found that difficult to answer, because well, I like a mix of both. I expressed that I have a very flexible skill set, but I get the idea that the employers looking for hardware guys are seeking computer engineers, and the employers looking for software guys are seeking software engineers. Computer systems is basically a mix of both, and due to my lack of experience in the industry, I don't know what I would *enjoy* more if I could only pick one.

I enjoy computer science, I do pretty good in the classes that do low level stuff like assembly, cache organization, etc. On the other hand I find my data structures classes challenging and I don't particularly hate it because I am learning so much.

I will also add that I do freelance/word-of-mouth computer repair IT stuff, it's easy money and along with tech retail experience I have, I have no problem communicating with clients or expressing my ideas. I find this as a trait most CS majors do not have.

I have been in a relationship with my fiancee for about 4 and a half years, and she is a really outgoing person and is a theater member. 

Note whenever I am saying party, she doesnt get drunk (maybe 1 time a year). 

Currently I am trying to not get upset over something, but is coming to be near impossible.
Back story:

We go to 2 different colleges, and during one of the nights she was at a friends party she offered to show 2 of the guests where they would be staying (walking them just to the building). One of them decided that he would grab her, kiss her and ask if she wanted to go upstairs with him. As I stated, she is outgoing and pretty oblivious. She was giving him mixed signals due to being just nice, such as hugging both of them goodbye. She told me the night after it happened, but I was still upset that she put herself in the situation. Told her to be more careful.

Fast forward a year later, I was up at her school and met some of her guy friends she parties with. One of these guys a week later runs into her in the stairwell after they both had drank and she hugged him goodbye (once again...) and he kissed her..she didnt say anything and just walked away. She did not tell me for a week, when i came up to see her. She thought hugging him was fine because he was a friend and knew she was engaged (met me already). I have huge trust issues with her guy friends, but i just ""deal with it"" in order for her to be happy and hang out with her friends. She told me and cried for hours right after I just told her I would try and be more trusting with her guy friends...as in 10 seconds after I said it. I went over to his room, punched him in the gut, told him to stay the fuck away from her and not talk to her again, and told her she really needs to stop being so familiar with other guys. 

This last month I had a 2fer. I found out her normal room she drinks with her friends happens to be his room, but I can confirm that he does not talk to her and vice-versa. It was just she didnt think to tell me for 7 months that he lived in the room, seeing as how they dont talk she didnt think it was a big deal. ALSO she got the lead role in a play, in which she has to kiss the male lead, and not just on stage, during every practice for 2 months as well, once every time they go through that scene, 3-4 rehearsals a week. She did not know about this when she auditioned.

My blood still boils every time I think of these events. I am trying to get over them, but by the time I am about to another related problem pops up. It has helped that she seems immensely remorseful and sorry every time something has happened and she said the last thing she wants to do is hurt me in any way. She was going to turn down her part in the play but I told her not to otherwise I knew she would resent me for it, even though I do resent the fact she kisses another guy for her part, I just....deal with it.

I feel as if something special is being taken away from me. It is something that only me and her do. We talk a lot how ""you are mine! and I am yours!"" Jokingly and cute-like. She has been my 1 and only gf, she took my first everything. Other guys kissing her just drains me whenever I think about it, and this roll she got is just the last push I needed before I started getting really upset over it and realized it. I don't know of any method other than just bottling it up and ""dealing with it"", as it is the main way I got through my school years. 

We did discuss it, and I told her pretty much what I posted here about having it feel like it was taking away part of what was ours. I am not a confident man by any means anymore. I got diagnosed with T1 diabetes my freshman semester in college, and I lost all of my muscle mass in the hospital. I have had issues working out sense, and I still live with my parents since I work a no-pay internship for my last semester. I also do not get to see her but like once MAYBE twice every month since we both lack cars. The things we do together that are ours, was pretty much my last salvation when it came to my confidence.....

Any advice guys? I am getting pretty damn depressed with this coupled with other things. I figure things will be better once I am able to move out and start a career and she moves in with me so we can actually see each other. I have complete trust in her, I know she hasnt cheated on me...I have too many eyes and ears on her campus to know otherwise. I just fear I will hit in the face with a big ol' blob of depression. "

In the film the protagonist is in Congo, skyping is girlfriend in Holland.

----------

Currently a junior in the University of Michigan's College of Engineering. Currently double-majoring in CS/CE, because I enjoy both and at this point, I feel two degrees might help me stand out more in the post-college job market. Have covered lots of core classes in both degrees. Looking for a summer internship, potentially at a startup, as I really enjoyed my previous experience and how casual it was. I also actually enjoy dressing formal (part of why Chicago attracts me is it's fashion-style from the Mile and the financial district), so I can go either way.

I've got quite some experience under my belt -- my first computing job was working for the University of Michigan under their EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) department, on developing a C-based Windows driver (NDIS, involving network transmissions and the OSI model -- I completed two semesters of Cisco's Networking Academy) for a software-defined radio, developed by Microsoft Research. That was two summers ago.

My second (last summer) was working for a large startup in Austin, Texas, doing front/back-end web development. I became fairly proficient in C# ASP.NET MVC dev; and learned how to incorporate multiple API's, and existing in-house systems and the like. I learned how to do revision control (for the previous job, I created my own style of revision control involving Dropbox, and it was sloppy compared to, say, Git -- something which, by the way, I use in my programming projects for college all the time, now). Also learned how to participate in the Agile style of code/management. Would love to discuss this in detail with potential employers.

In my spare time, I've written scripts to make my Macbook embed music information from nearly any client on the desktop, little plugins for Adium (an AIM/everything else client), and things like that. I've also written short programs to help my workload. More notably, for college, I have written sorting algorithms/breadth &amp; depth searches, started to learn how to properly hash, and, for the extra push to get a good grade in a prior class, taught myself basic Android development and wrote my own app.

To tell it to you straight: I don't particularly like doing front-end development, and I LOVE back-end dev. Javascript is cool and all, and learning good object-oriented programming was really beneficial overall, but writing raw HTML was...annoying at best. The company I worked for admitted willfully that my distaste stemmed from the fact that the site I was assigned was created rather sloppily from another company, and I had to work around what I was given, but regardless. If I am paid well enough, I'll happily do front-end work, but for the record, I prefer things that are C#/C++/C based. I just enjoy that language set; it makes sense to me.

**Code samples and a resume happily available upon request, as are more details. I'd love to talk about this all at-length. Whatever opportunities Reddit can find for me, I will pursue.**

**Thank you for your time, I hope to hear from you all sometime soon.**"
qmyzn,1,2012-03-08,Invisible Children Former Intern Blog in Response to Criticism,ICformerintern,KONY,https://www.reddit.com/r/KONY/comments/qmyzn/invisible_children_former_intern_blog_in_response/,"I'm going to share some of my thoughts about the backlash to the KONY2012 campaign. Mind you, I am sharing all of this with you as a former intern for Invisible Children, meaning that I am biased but that I, along with hundreds of other roadies and interns who volunteered their time to work for free because it was a cause we believed in, have perhaps more knowledge of the goings-on of the organization that the average person sitting at home reading Tumblr.

--The founders of Invisible Children were very young when they started the organization, as in just graduated or not yet graduated from college. This means that they made mistakes along the way, like taking that photo with the Ugandan army holding guns.

--The founders started the organization with no money, no employees, no office, no plans, basically nothing. They worked for free and lived at home and spent their time and money sharing the stories they had seen with other young people in hopes of changing their perspective. They got more organized, got a plan, recruited more people (to work for free) and expanded. They started touring the country, creating more young activists and starting programs in Uganda to develop the region. They made more mistakes, programs that weren't realistic or that weren't getting to the root of the problems. So, they kept at it, revised their programs and their strategies for awareness, until they got to where they are today. 

--Their salaries of around $90,000 are hardly outrageous when you consider they were working for free for so long and that their revenue was $13.77 million last year. The president of the March of Dimes made $631,877 in 2010. The president of the Livestrong Foundation made $321,821 in 2010. The CEO of Save the Children made $391,194 in 2010. The executive director of Doctors Without Borders made $116,577 in 2010. The president and CEO of the ASPCA made $510,464 in 2010. (2010 was the most recent data available on Charity Navigator for these organizations).

--The mission of Invisible Children is a two-fold mission with equal emphasis. The first part is ending the conflict in central Africa and helping develop the area. The second part is growing a coalition of global citizens in America, youth who are concerned with people, events, and issues around the globe and who are motivated to do something about it. A lot of Invisible Children's focus (and consequently their money) is spent on developing a generation of activists, not necessarily activists for African conflicts, just people who are motivated to stand up for what they believe in and believe they can make a difference.

--Lastly, while I agree that  the info from Invisible Children can be misleading at times in terms of the current state of the conflict, I think many people are missing the larger point. Even if Kony and the LRA weren't still a threat (but they are) he still deserves to be caught and tried for his war crimes. The fact remains that if any of these atrocities happened in America or to American children we would stop at nothing to make sure it could not continue to happen and that the perpetrators were brought to justice.
These are just my sort of jumbled thoughts on the topic that I chose to share because I feel like a lot of people who are criticizing IC are just as uninformed as the people blindly supporting them.

--Also, yes I think anyone who puts any thought into it realizes that just sharing the video and retweeting people is not going to stop Kony. The point isn't just to spread awareness, it's to spread awareness that will inspire people to DO something. Invisible Children isn't just spreading awareness, they put in place a radio network to stop attacks, they are giving kids scholarships and improving their schools, they are allowing people to start small businesses, and so much more. Social media campaigns are the vehicle for awareness and inspiration that lead to ACTION, they are not the end goal and IC is not claiming they are."

This subreddit has been very helpful for both I and my 13 year old bro (who hasn't started yet but knows exactly what he wants)

I have a little situation, there's a very solid software development company that I want to work for in the future. I've got connections into the company, but not exactly as a software engineer person (especially since I have no experience). I asked someone who works there what language do they want their employees to be proficient in, and I was told that most people they want are efficient with Java (yikes). They told me in 5 months, send my resume over to them, and they will see what they can do as far as getting me a paid internship with the software development team.


Now...I by NO means expect to be a Java master within 5 months. I just want to develop a solid/basic understanding of Java, enough so that I'd be acceptable as an intern to this amazing company.

Is that realistic? Should I just jump straight into a Java course? Is there another language that would help me develop fundamentals that are really similar to Java writing? I JUST started CarlH's lectures and, while I don't feel like I'd be wasting my time with C, I am jsut curious if there is a better way of going about it.

Last year, I want to say around this time, my boyfriend and I met a girl at a party. We decided to try a threesome. I don't consider myself bisexual, I am just willing to do anything he asks me to. The experience went as well as one could hope for and we even meet again. Fast forward a few weeks later. My boyfriend and I break up. Now I'm not sure what exactly happened after we broke up, but a month later I (this is shameful to admit) pretty much begged for him back. He just meant too much to me. In the month we had broken up, he hooked back up with the girl from our threesome at least once. I don't want to ask him about any more nights, I just can't think about it. I do trust that he would tell me the truth. We got back together, everything was sorted out and it's been great since. Recently we've started discussing the possibility of a ring.

**This is where I need help**

The past month or so, he has begun texting/im'ing this girl quite a lot. I've been very stressed out from work and he's noticed this. It's been tense. It's gotten to the point where it's almost constant contact between him and this girl. I've only gotten to peek at what they've been saying once or twice and it was all pretty dry stuff. Just talking about school/work/what they're eating. I am usual very level-headed but there's just something about this girl that gives me pangs (yes! PANGS!) of jealousy everytime I hear his phone buzz. This is made even worse by the fact my boyfriend is going to be leaving for an internship 250 miles away. There won't be much time for visits because we both work full-time. It is very apparent that I'm going to miss him more than he misses me.

I want to know, is it time to move on? I have never felt so strongly about someone, and because of this I am trepidatious. I want to trust him, and I know it probably is idle chatter. However, It's a constant stream. It only stops at night. I know it's going to get worse when he leaves, and I worry that he's going to drop me all together. Should I leave now before I get hurt?"

My GPA is on the low end of the spectrum but I am not going to lie the coursework was very difficult.

Maybe you guys could point out things I might have overlooked or you have gone through this before.

***Job 1.***

Engineering position at a coal mine where I currently live. It would mostly be an office job with some field work in the coal mines. I have worked here for almost 2 years doing an internship and really like it. Only problem is they offered me initially $63,000. That was about 10 grand less than average so after talking to them they came up to $68,000. I tried to get them to come up some more but $68,000 is final.

***Job 2.***

Underground production supervisor. I would have to move to a different part of the country, which I wouldn't mind given that they are paying for moving expenses. My wife would have to transfer school and pay out of state tuition for a year. It's also possible she won't get accepted to the other school. I visited their mine and liked it. I also liked the state, although not as much as my home state. I'm sure I could grow to love the place. The starting salary here will be $84,500 a year, and I would also get $14,000 in starting bonuses.

_______

It seems clear cut to choose the one with the higher if I like it there and my wife is willing to move. I just really want to do engineering work. That's why I went to college and all.

I will answer more questions you guys have. I couldn't fit everything into the paragraph but there are quite a few more things affecting my decision making.

However, I'm usually pretty nervous during phone interviews.  In-person interviews I do just fine, but phone interviews... yes, I'm terrible at those.

So what I plan to do is have kind of a page of notes so I don't forget my stuff (this seems to always be the case - I'll forget everything I've ever known).  However, past that I have no idea.  I'm going to do it from campus, where I have a work space that is quiet and distraction-free.

Do you guys have any more advice?  It's not until next week.  I am already trying to figure out what I need to research to make sure I have a basic knowledge of them (I've already done my research on the company itself for the previous interview, but I know that I'm going to need to brush up on MySQL, Java, and general Internet technology (servlets, TCP/IP, etc - this one especially since this is the one that I did terrible at during the in-person interview)."

I applied for a bunch of summer internships the past couple of months and I got an interview with a firm in Manhattan over winter break in December (they called me for an interview a week after I sent my resume). I went down there, liked the place, liked the people. They seemed to like me. They said they usually don't hire interns until March, but they would be in contact.

Fast forward to the end of January. Nobody else has called me for an interview. I decide to give my contact there a call and let him know I'm still interested. He says it looks good for me, but they're still finalizing paperwork. The next day (probably as a result of my call) I get an email with and offer, $14/hr. I ask for some time to decide, they say they would like to know by the end of the week. I talk it over with my dad, he says I should go for it because I liked the place, my GPA isn't that great and internships may be hard to come by. I accept the offer the next day.

So today, I just received a call from a different firm that happens to be right down the street from the first firm. They say they're interested in me, I say I already accepted an offer. She asks from who, I say the firm, she says ""Ooo...yeah, they just laid off six people..."" and goes on to tell me how much better they are, they pay more ($15-18), I could possibly have Fridays off depending on where I work, and (The big thing for me) they hire 90% of their interns after graduation. She says she usually doesn't try to poach off other firms, but they really liked my resume and cover letter. I schedule and interview this week just to check them out.

I did some research on my own and the second firm is consistently ranked higher than the first, albeit not by much. 

So what's the etiquette here? Is there any way for me to back out of the first offer without looking like a jackwagon? I did note that the offer letter and application said that it is not a legally binding contract and either party could back out at any time.  Should I even go for this interview?  

If anyone works in Manhattan and has experience with the firms there, feel free to msg me so we can talk privately.  

**TL;DR: I accepted an internship offer from a firm. Second, seemingly better (and better paying) firm is interested in me as well. Halp**"

To make a short story short. The internship that I originally had lined up just informed me that they could not put me in a placement anymore. This is an attempt to try to find any opportunities that are out there. I'm currently looking for anything that might keep me occupied for 2+ months. I am also willing to work anywhere in Canada.

For my program, the internship would have to have a specific scope to the project, deliverables, and identify the process in which I will meet the objectives. 

There may be a larger scope that encompasses various activities, but my program does need a scope defined.

If you require more information from me, please send a message and include some contact info.

Beggars can't be choosers?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qor0m/internship_advice_need_help_take_it_or_leave_it/,"Hi Reddit. I need a little bit of an advice about internships. I am a super (super) senior, set to graduate in May of 2013 for a Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering. I have zero internship experience and I have been scrambling to find one for the last couple of months. I have been rejected several times, but you know, you just have to keep trying!

Last week, I got an offer for a role to design the synthesis of some sort of renewable fuel, estimate costs, etc (can't really get into too much detail). Anyway, this is exciting news, right? Finally! Apparently, I had sold myself well during the interview.

Anyway, here is my dilemma: It is mostly an independent project, which means that I will have to work on my own. I have been looking for internships because I want to gain hands-on experience with either my peers or other professionals (consult them, work with them, all that jazz). In addition, the internship role entails the use of a program that I have barely touched upon in an engineering class from last semester. I am familiar with the basics, but designing the whole process using this program will be a huge task that will entail serious research on my behalf. I can't say that the simulation program is really my strongest point. The company itself is really just a start-up. No office; the owner just sits at some cafes and work there. In addition, he travels a whole lot. So I quite honestly do not feel a sense of security. But mind you, if this thing actually takes off, it will be HUGE! I think. Yeah, HUGE!

So basically, I have been thinking about maybe looking for other internships where I can actually work with other people. But at the same time, I don't really have any interviews lined up at the moment. What if I let this internship go and I don't get anymore interviews/offers? To be honest, I truly want an internship to gain experience, and I feel that I won't really gain much with this specific one. But then again, there's that saying (and excuse me if you hate it) ""Beggars can't be choosers."" Who am I to turn down one when it's the first one to give me an offer?

There's also the factor that I'm not 100% confident about the role and if I'll be able to perform well. The guy wants me to have the planning ready in about two months or so. The task seems a bit daunting, and quite honestly, I'll have more heart to do it if I know that I'll be working in a team of some sort. I don't want to wrinkle his plans of possibly getting a prototype together by the end of the year + more.

So do I take it for the sake of having an internship (and run the risk of ""Ohhhh shi--. I actually can't do this"") or just keep looking for other internships (and hope that I get at least one offer)?

HELP! I'd appreciate your input. Thank you! :)

I'm a senior in university and my major is accounting.  I am a full time student and also work 30+ hours a week with my internship and doing book keeping for multiple non-profits in my city.  I had to fulfill a ""science"" type of credit that I needed to graduate this June.  I still have next quarter to do it if necessary but I would like to avoid this at all costs.

I signed up for introduction to c++ coding this quarter thinking I'd be able to get through it if I stuck to it.  I was right for the most part considering my professor can't get through an entire sentence without mumbling to himself.  It is incredibly hard to understand anything that he says.  His teaching methods are through using powerpoints to explain coding without actually doing the coding himself in front of the students.  There are no computers in the class to try the coding we learn during class.  Only desks to sit in. I have gone in for help during his office hours many times over the quarter and he will never even give me one line of code if I told him I have spent hours trying to figure out how to make the program work.

 Fast forward to the midterm.  I had completed all of my programming homework assignments (worth 50% of my grade) up to the midterm and done reasonably well on them getting an average of 92%.  I passed the open note (may have the homework assignments printed out) midterm with an 88%.  Since the midterm I haven't been able to keep up or understand the concepts and I have been spending the same amount of time out of class that I can to learn this.

I have 3 more programming assignments left (about 20% of my grade) that I have to turn in by Monday the 12th and I have no clue how to finish these.  These assignments involve making a program that will compile two lists from .txt files and having them put together a union, merge, and intersection of the lists into a new .txt file.  The second program is re-doing one of the older assignments, a poor man's version of asteroids, using classes.

If anybody is willing to help me I would be extremely grateful."

This artifact was recently unearthed in rural Albania. It is believed to be an internal employee handbook circulated around the Blizzard operating centre.

Accessible - Easily understandable by people who have never played a game before ever.

Activision (the) - A paramilitary organization that we merged with a few years ago. They seem nice, but we still aren't sure what the armored suits with the huge 'A' and skull logo are for. Or why our interns keep vanishing. 

Annual Pass - A jumbo patch slapped over the hull of WoW to prevent further subscription leakage. Promising a free copy of D3 and access to the MoP beta, many fans only saw 'D3', 'free' and 'Beta' and jumped on board. 

Andariel - We designed this boss to kill players who spent too much time staring at her...assets to avoid her nova.

Asmodan - The Lord of Sin. We believe he is in charge of managing the microtransaction department at present.

Baal - The Lord of Destruction. We put this guy in charge of the department working on Boss Fatalities, the Mystic, Coloured Lighting, Runes as Items, Skill Trees, Day/Night changes, dynamic weather and the 6th class. We stand by this decision.

Battlenet 2.0 - Disguised as a platform for which all of our games can be interconnected, it is really a clever way for us to eliminate all forms of communication amongst our customers, lest they conspire to ask for things like 'balance' or 'additional features'.

Beliel - The Lord of Lies. Currently employed as head of PR and marketting for Diablo 3.

Beta - Never has half an hour of game content caused so many people to go entirely apecrap. We need to find a way to monetize this. 

Beta Contest - Despite our 'random is fair' opt-in process, we believe that forcing players to jump through hoops, sign up to social media they do not want and subscribe to gaming sites they have never even heard of is a far better idea. 

Beta Patch - A simple numerical increase with minor system twiddling purely to keep hype alive. 14 down, 28 to go!

Bobby Kotick - Currently believed to be the host of the prime evil Diablo. His coming marks the start of the Funocalypse - the end of all fun on earth. 

Customer - A four legged plant eating mammal that produces milk. Our goal is to extract the maximum amount of milk with the minimum amount of moo.
Also see. Cattle. 

Customization - Formerly referred to creating unique, fun characters through various schemes. However, this required forethought and permanent choices - two traits that we deem our customers are unable to possess. Thus, we have redefined ""customization"" to mean the singular ability to buy gear from the auction house and have the customers' characters hold said gear. 

Diablo - The Lord of Terror. Currently occupying the form of the Sovereign, Bobby Kotick.

Diablo 2 - A hilarious experiment designed for griefers, bots, scammers and hackers. Hopefully if we give them this they will stay there and not bother the rest of our games.

Diablo 3 - A gothic ARPG themed Casino. However after removing transaction fees, the Activision is concerned that Diablo 3 will not be profitable and are holding it back while they find some ways to add Microtransactions to Boss Farming. 

Duriel - No one knows how the real final boss of Diablo 2 snuck into act 2. His task was to frustrate the living hell out of casters and ranged characters before they got their decent spells. His full title is ""Duriel: Lord of Pain in the @#!"". 

Forums (the) - These were designed to allow designers to feel like Greek gods, watching the misery and consternation caused by every word they spoke. Currently they serve as a wastebin for feedback, criticism and discussion so that we don't need to read it.

Inferno Mode - Our substitute for real endgame content. Players can enjoy running through the same content they have just completed three times, only now with higher numbers!

Lan - A false memory implanted by our competitors. The Lan never existed in any form and evidence to the contrary is part of an elaborate conspiracy. The technology just isn't there yet.

Loot - The centre of the gaming universe. These magical collections of pictures and numbers have in the past inspired lawsuits, murders, divorce, brawls, real money transactions, oral favours and tons and tons of QQ. It also follows laws of it's own that frequently differ from the laws of physics. Adventurers are frequently shocked the first time they swat the mosquito which has just landed on their ear and it proceeds to drop a three hundred kilogram battleaxe. 

Mists of Pandaria - Our attempt to cash in on the Pokemon phenomenon and give WoW players a reason to pay 40$. If we can twist the arms of people subscribed to the 1 Year Deal into doing the same, fantastic.

Oceania - Much like the Lan, this does not exist. Players claiming to be from here are an anomaly and can be safely ignored for the purposes of Beta waves, maintenance times and server location. Why do sheep need servers anyway?

Polishing - Still overhauling key systems and fixing serious bugs. 
See: Almost Finished.

Release Date - A mythical creature often discussed but never seen in the wild.

Runes - A powerful skill customization system for Diablo 3 aimed at letting players specialize and level how they wanted to. However the initial system was too complicated for Zarhym's Grandmother to understand and so we tacked on an arbitrary level requirement to the runes and replaced the whole thing with the skill system from WoW.

Starcraft - For some reason this became a national sport of a country. We are not quite sure how to undo this. Even taking 50% of the profits from tournaments hasn't discouraged them, forcing us to continue to balance and refine it. If you have any suggestions as to a replacement, please let us know.

Soon - Sometime within the next 5 years, although it may be longer.

Titan - The Titan Project started as a successor to WoW. However under the Activision we believe it has evolved into some kind of supersoldier experiment deep in the bowels of Blizzard HQ. We generally supply one or two test subjects a week and let them get on with it. Please ignore the screams.

Warcraft 3 - Where we get the majority of our World of Warcraft stories, engine and assets. 

World of Warcraft - Our cash cow. For some reason we cannot quite understand not only will people pay 15$ a month to keep playing this, they will also spend as much on a sparkly horse mount or a server transfer. These days we primarily leave Jim and the new employees to keep an eye on things while fishing.
Also see: Cash Machine.

Zarhym - Blue Poster in possession of a bad $#! Grandmother!

Zarhym's Grandmother - She showed up one day and Zarhym suggested we make her our lead game tester for Diablo 3. We weren't sure...but she was such a nice old lady that we couldn't really say no. Now Bobby says that all systems must be easily understood by her or simplified. We'll get on it once we get her to stop feeding the mouse and attempting to plug her typewriter in.

9th grade I had 4 Honors Classes (the highest possible amount for that year), 10th grade I had one IB class and one AP, but I also took Algebra 2, which put me a year ahead of the average math schedule (I'm in my 5th year of high school math as well), Junior year I had 4 IB Classes, and this (Senior) year I have 4 IB classes as well, which puts me up to a grand total of 14 throughout High School.  
My senior year first semester grades are probably some of the best I've ever had, with the first quarter giving me a 4.1, and my first semester GPA in general came out to a 3.85."

If it goes bad, who knows?",suicidethrowaway1112,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qom14/court_tomorrow_if_it_goes_bad_who_knows/,"First I should go into what you should know about me so you can get a feel why I'm pretty set on killing myself if I have to go to jail or something. I am the baby in my family. I've always had someone to love and care for me. I was blessed with amazing intelligence, which I am very grateful for. My whole life I've been taught that with hard work I'll be able to go to a good college, get a good job and live happily in a nice house with a nice family. I did everything I was supposed to in high school, graduating with a 3.8. Finally, I got what I was promised and continued on to a very good college. I entered college this fall. Here is things get nasty. The transition to college from high school was very hard. I've never worked so hard in my life. 

Well, after my first mid term ever in college I felt okay. It was a very hard test but I had to remind myself that it was curved so it didn't matter. I texted my friend in my class and asked what she thought of it. She said it was super easy and that she finished early and left. I was crushed. (I'm not sure why but I was) I cried all day until my friends came over to go to a concert we had tickets to. This is when I ran into the law. I went there just trying to have a good time. I was dancing and was pretty close to the front when this chick behind me taps me on the shoulder and says something about her friend right behind me not being able to see. I don't know what she expected me to do, so I say to her ""It's a concert bro"", and turn back around. She then turns to her friend and starts laughing at me because I said ""bro"". I was keeping cool but then she started pushing me. Mind you that she is the only one around me pushing me and she's not directly behind, right, left or in front of me. Finally after a few pushes I turn around a bop her in the face. I'm not a violent person, everyone that knows me would know that that was completely out of character for me. That evening I was super emotional from the midterm and I took it out the wrong way. She says ""YOU PUNCHED ME!!!"" I'm all ""You wouldn't leave me alone"". I guess I wasn't thinking, but I stayed in the same place. She got the security and I was escorted out. The security were pretty nice to me. The first guy even thought I would be able to go back to the concert. Well I'm sitting there and a small fire truck comes. She had firefighters come to examine her face and put an ice pack on it. Which there was 0 damage done. No bruises, no swelling, no cuts. The firefighters put a pack of ice on it and leave. Then the police come. They were pretty much huge ass holes to me. I thought it was pretty funny because they were all ""well it's obvious you aren't telling the truth, and we'll see that when she tells her story and see that they are different"". We had the same story, but that's besides the point. The whole time I was apologetic. Even right after she left I was thinking about going back and finding her and saying sorry. The whole time I was beyond cooperative and beyond apologetic. I mean the police asked for my name and address without looking at my ID and I gave all the correct information. Any ways, they didn't take me in because this girl ""had mercy on me"" as the police put it. They told me that I would hear from them within 90 days. Also, after the police said I could go, me and my friends were walking and we saw her (she didn't go back to the concert even though she could) and she had thrown the ice pack away. 90 days passed and I didn't hear anything from them so I was pretty happy because I thought they weren't pressing charges. Well two weeks ago I finally got the letter summoning me to court. I was completely crushed. I had just applied for this program at my college where I would be an intern at Boeing. Even worse the court date was right before my math final for this quarter.

So here I am, it's the night before my court date. I just REALLY needed to get this off my chest. Basically I feel like this could just totally fuck up all the hard work I went through to get where I am. I have nothing besides school. I can't just live with my parents my whole life. I have a final on Saturday and I just can't understand Taylor series worth shit. But who cares because I might be going to jail anyways. If I am sentenced to go to jail I will be killing myself. I've counted all my mom's sleeping pills. 

This is a throw away. But thank you reddit. You've been great. 

tl;dr I have court tomorrow for assault charges, if it ends up fucking my life then I will personally fuck it. "

I am a college freshman, and have no formal education when it comes to the cosmos, outside of a physics class in high school and an intro to astronomy class right now. I have been fascinated by the universe since childhood, but only in the past few years have I really been hooked on astronomy.

Just as a little more clarification on my current knowledge: I have seen what feels like every non-fictional television show concerning space there is; I recently got an Astromaster 90 and have been viewing planets, the moon, and the Orion nebula; and I am constantly reading articles in a select few magazines concerning space.

A few things I would greatly appreciate having some clarification on:

* Will I need to attend graduate school and if so, what schools should I look towards?

* What kind of financial burdens can I expect to encounter once I complete my bachelors?

* Are internships at this stage in my college career: vital, beneficial, a waste of time?

Any other information that may be pertinent will be much appreciated!

EDIT: If there is a better place for me to post this, I apologize; please let me know where it is better received."

qo5w7,4,2012-03-08,How do I get a raise out of my boss without being a dick?,LinuxMercedes,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qo5w7/how_do_i_get_a_raise_out_of_my_boss_without_being/,"I'm a student worker at my university. I work in IT-Research Support, which is the branch of IT responsible for supporting research professors. As this university is all about research, you'd expect us to be pretty important...which is entirely not the case. Instead, we're 3 full time employees and 5 students running a cluster, building one-off research tech, setting up sensors to gather data, and many, many other things. And we're all significantly underpaid, even for the middle-of-nowhere town that we live in. 

I've worked at this job for over 2 years. I stay around mostly because I like the work (I administer all the linux computer labs, among other things). 

Recently, my boss has decided to try to get us some publicity so that people realize that what we do is a lot of hard work, and therefore land us some more money for the team. The way he's decided to do this is by putting all of the student workers on one project that is going to be pretty impressive (I'd say what it is but I'm under NDA). The project involves a lot of cutting-edge tech and is about the same type of work undergraduate research students do here. Unfortunately, this project has a ridiculously tight deadline, and my boss knows the only way we'll get close to making it is if we all work more hours than we're getting paid for. (We can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week as full-time students.) I, in particular, have much more experience with the tech on this project than any of my co-workers, and I can objectively say the project would fail if I left, unless my boss was able to find someone to replace me within a week. Most of the people here who could replace me are working on other projects or jobs that pay more than what this one does. I know, because I've tried to recruit them for this project...

On top of this, he's lately made a couple points when he asks why things aren't getting done or why we haven't been at work at times (we get to choose our own hours). We'll be like, ""But I have homework/other things to do"" and he's said, literally, ""That's not my problem.""

On top of all that, he's paying me $8.75 an hour. The USGS recently posted part-time student job openings for CS majors at $15 an hour. I've got an internship at Amazon this summer, so I'm pretty confident I can land a position at the USGS if I wanted to. The *only* thing that keeps me from doing that is that I like my work. That, and one of the students is using this project as a final project for his senior capstone class, so if the project fails he can't graduate. 

tl;dr: My boss is kind of a dick, and he doesn't pay me anywhere near what I'm worth. 

How do I go about getting some respect and a raise from him?"

Cold science. Hannah had the results from the failed experiment in her hands. Small consolation this black and white document would further her quest: the grail of the human cognitive sciences. She wanted to finally know, in concrete form, what motivated people. 

She approved David's application for the new trials because he had agreed to secrecy. And because he was probably the only man she would ever have sex with. She liked him. He destroyed the muggers that attacked her in the city. Healed now, his scar from one of the attackers left a faint line from his left eye to the corner of his tanned mouth. *Blue sky to sand*. Her vision glazed over and she remembered his scent of salt and cedar.

She read her notes. *People can save others' lives through self sacrifice. People can kill millions of other people in a blink. Human existence itself relies on the actions of every person on this planet, to whatever end...*

In her spare time she wrote reports, researched the latest breakthroughs in medicine, and purchased bits of history. The time flew by as the brown packages arrived at her door. She was closer to realizing her dreams. The results were going to be fantastic. 

She was going to be rich. The new drug that was privately funded was hers only if she had agreed to the strict confidential agreement. Hannah had to make the best of it. She had the finest bio-metric measuring devices, cameras, and computer systems. *This was going to be easy* she reassured herself.

She had sway and tenure, and could always count on getting the full attention of the faculty. It had been no problem setting her experiment in motion. Her beauty had the right flaw that taunted perfection, and it made her approachable to a fault. Even the blind followed her everywhere. Everywhere except where she was going next. With David.



                                          David

David was on time for the first time in his life. He loved Hannah. He forgot things with her. 

Things he didn't want to remember. 

He blackmailed doctors tied up with black market medicine. Their kickback money came in handy for college but he never forgot how he achieved his vaulted credentials. There was a time during internship he was going to open a clinic in some great city. As a healer, he would 
improve the lives of all who came to him. Then he realized the dark part of himself that learned pharma traffic routes, fronts, and contacts had always been there, and was just waiting for the right opportunity. 

This trial with Hannah was a means to an end. A way to satisfy, and channel, his less than desirable urges toward something good. He wanted Hannah on her terms. 

David felt strong again. He finished his final set of body weight exercises two nights ago. Well before he would see her. He was happy to taper off before *this* event.

The wing harboring Hannah's experiment room hadn't been used before. *Neither have I* she 

mused, *Odd*. Her eyes dotted purple, the blue mixing with the last red light of day through her lace office curtain. She raised from her desk and looked out of her open window. A breeze delivered David's aroma to her nose. Everything was in place and she was ready to begin.

She strolled down the hall to the control room. Unlocking the door to the room she was going to use for her experiments, she paused. Everything was new and gleamed, having been set up as a clean room. It was a completely controlled environment: optimum regulated oxygen supply, humidity, temperature, and light. She lay on the bed. The sheets were handmade Chinese silk, unused from some royal family in China's opulent past. She walked back out to the hall - didn't want to seem *too* eager today. She locked the door back, and returned to her office.



David arrived at the agreed time.
""Did you take the pill?"" she queried.
""Yes.""
""Well then, you first."" She unlocked the door, and he walked in before her. Closing the door caused an echo throughout the complex.
David's eyes widened. 
""It's quiet.""
""Is that okay?"" She attempted a frown but nothing could hide her smile. It was wide and full. 

She closed her lips around her nervous expression, straightening her shoulders. She was 5'8"" tall, but appeared much taller. Her body filled the artists' proportion and her legs were long.
""How are you? Does the sensory perception throw you off at all?"" She quizzed. 
He reached out and touched her shoulder with his right hand, then her other shoulder with his left. He looked into her eyes, and tilted his head slightly to match her hug indicating posture.  

Pulling her close, David glanced at her mouth, lowered his head and pressed his lips into hers. She breathed in sharply, waited for a drifting second, then slowly exhaled. Her perfume, some Hawaiian flower, filled his mind. She led him to the bed. 

Undressing in the dim golden light the curved and lined shadows danced on their bodies. It looked like a fire was burning somewhere in the room, and the glow basked them in radiance. 

Laying down he reached out and touched her before she was completely on the bed. She responded by shifting under him. He pushed up, his arms bending then straightening over her. 

He put each hand flat on the bed beside her elbows. He lowered himself on her, feeling himself part her. He was aware of the lack of sensation the pill was supposed to cause. It was working. He only felt the slightest presence of something there, around him.

She watched David and slid her hands down his sides. He put some of his weight on her, testing her, and she felt the ridges of his muscles against her thighs. He moved slowly around, and up and down as he kissed her. His stomach touched hers which set off an electric sensation, like a butterfly on the back of her hand. Then she felt pressure.  

He felt minimal pressure, but no warmth and no tingling or pleasure. Well, at least nothing physical. He wondered at that revelation. The pill was designed to remove all but the barest of sensations. He could believe he was going to the bathroom if he didn't see her and know what he was doing. If he wasn't lost in her somehow.

""What is it like?"" She said between deep breaths. 
""It is nice. *You* are nice. The physical effects are...not really there, though.""
He felt completely solid to her. Everything she was feeling promised to push her over some edge of pleasure she had never felt before. Every move he made she met with enthusiasm, pushing against him harder and faster with his penetrations. Somehow it seemed he managed 
to open her wider and deeper with each gentle push. And with every pull, her muscle constrictions tried to keep him in her. He moved so fast now that she was having one continuous sensation of pressure and motion and warmth. The sensation increased making her quiver. She grabbed him and pulled him in, their bodies finding their own rhythm. She let it take her over. She was completely filled with him at every thrust. 

It was what she desired now. In one surprising, soft motion, her legs tensed. She was consumed with contractions and pleasure. She opened her legs wider and grabbed the back of his legs to pull him in, again and again. Waves of pleasure rose to wash over her, tickling warmth caressed her body. She felt him continue and she wanted more. 
""I don't feel tired."" he pleaded with his topaz eyes. ""I can't feel anything, but I don't want to stop. You are amazing!""
She slowed him down and wrapped her legs around his back, resting on the lines of his hips. 
""I.. love you."" he said.
She raised her hands to her chest sliding them over her firm nipples, then wrapped her fingers in his hair. His mouth was willingly lead to her breasts, where he kissed her softly. Her prim points became firmer with every touch. He put one after the other into his mouth and she pleasantly realized his tongue was much hotter than his lips. 
""Can you feel it?"" she begged. 
""No. I can't stop though. I won't stop. I will have more of you. I am letting you go wherever you want with me, and I will know you completely."" 
She felt the blood rush to her head and was taken to a place she had never been before: a valley, a rushing sensation, rising to a peak of clear euphoria. Her body was still. There was an unending feeling of release mixed with the deepest relaxation.
Looking into her eyes, parting his lips, he spoke softly,
""I have you. I could not feel anything familiar I felt in the past, yet there was something there. Something with you that I couldn't pull away from. I felt driven."" 
Hannah moved her lips slowly and eased his mind.
""I'm not worried about the results right now. I know the computers have the numbers and will corroborate my research. How about you?""
""I'm free tomorrow."" He bared his teeth that glowed in the dim light. 

Hannah took one last, lingering look at him laying next to her before she would get up to leave. 
""Sex sells. Tomorrow, no pill, Mr. bittersweet."""

Looking for advice.,__truestory__,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qqmqk/starting_to_apply_for_jobs_in_2_months_looking/,"I'm currently doing my MS, and I have a fairly nice CV, with a couple of good internships (a GSoC, an RAish internship, another one at a startup, a few months of job experience at another startup, and a couple of months of experience as an RA at my current university). I'm fairly comfortable with being grilled over my earlier projects, but I tend to get stuck in the algorithmic/coding rounds. I've somehow managed to clear them in the past, but I know that this is a weakness, and I want to work on it in the next 2 months before I start sending in my applications.

My question is - what is the best way to prepare for such rounds which involve problems which are highly algorithmic in nature? Should I just start with solving problems on sites like codeeval.com, or problems from previous Code Jams? Should I review all the data structures and the most common algorithms, and code them up while doing that? Should I even care to pick up a book for that (just because books on such topics tend to be very exhaustive and it might not be possible to finish them cover to cover)? Or are there any concise books that I could refer? I'm just looking for the best way to tackle this. Any suggestions?

**TL;DR** What is the best way to prepare for highly algorithmic interview rounds?"
qqmfs,7,2012-03-10,"Questions on immigration. I know you guys get this a lot, but mine's a bit different. ",gaijin111,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/qqmfs/questions_on_immigration_i_know_you_guys_get_this/,"Hello r/Japan! Please pardon the length!

I've done some searching around and haven't been able to find helpful answers so I'm hoping you guys can help me out. Especially those with Japanese spouses.

I'm an American with a Japanese wife. We are currently doing long distance, which sucks ass. The plan was for her to move here this summer, and the paperwork for that is already underway. However, due to a plethora of circumstances and reasons, we are considering me moving to Japan for a little while, possibly up to a year but probably less. Before we make a decision, I need to know if this is even a possibility. I am already booked to visit her at the end of June, and we are both booked to come back together. Ideally, I would be able to get through the process and have a visa before then, but I know that's a a pretty tall order. I know for those immigrating to America, this isn't a huge deal. You can still enter the country before your visa is finished being processed, you just have to go through extra steps once it's done and change your residential status. But I can't figure out if it would work the same way for me. If I show up without a visa, but I have paperwork on file being processed, will I be able to stay? 

It seems to me that the visa application process is not too bad (at least compared to immigrating to the US). Having a Certificate of Eligibility I guess makes the process a lot easier and faster, at least if a Japanese company is sponsoring you. But does being sponsored by my wife help me just as much? I won't have a job before I go there, how much will that affect me? I know teaching English is the most common foot in the door, and I'm definitely interested in that. I am totally fine with doing any type of work, but I don't have a degree, so will English teaching still be an option for me? Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that schools really just want you to look foreign and speak English natively, and they don't really care about any other qualifications. If not, what kind of employment will I possibly be looking at? I should also point out that while I do speak some Japanese and can get by if someone's willing to let me struggle through a basic conversation, but I'm certainly not fluent so I guess any service job is out of the question.

My wife does have a nice steady salaryman job at a large company. If worst came to worst, she could technically support me being a house-husband pretty easily. I lived in Japan for a year before on an internship, so I do have some experience with the cultural differences/work culture/etc. My questions are just about semantics really. How tough is it to get a visa without a job, just through my wife? What kind of work can I expect to find without a degree? And most importantly, is it even feasible for me to hope to get through the visa process in less than 4 months? And if it's can't be done by then, can I legally enter the country and/or work while my application is under review?

Thanks you in advance for at least reading all this bullshit!"

Although it is a local company, most computer savvy people would know of their software.  Anyways, I know a few people at the company, my cousin works there, and I've landed myself an in person interview this coming Tuesday.

They have a very casual environment (Their employees wear jeans and a t-shirt everyday) but I'm hoping to make a good impression on whoever is interviewing me.  Although I have a fall back *job* for this summer, this internship could be the start of a *career* at this company.

So here are 3 different styles I've been working with.  Unfortunately I tried on my suit, and needless to say I've grown in the past 2.5 years since I got it.  Oh and as a side note, I started a diet a couple months ago, so the pants/belt combo don't fit me the best, but I'm mostly interested in getting a good *style* down, not the fit of my clothes.  (I don't have time/money to go out and getting clothes to make me look like you guys do)


So here is my go to outfit, a simple polo with khakis

Here is a simple collared shirt + khaki combo

Dark khakis: http://i.imgur.com/DM0ZN.jpg

And here is something a bit more fancy, shirt + tie + sweater

Sorry that I look awkward, I was trying to show off the clothes more then my appearance.

It would be awesome to know which khakis you guys prefer (see middle set) and which overall combo you think is the best for a tech internship interview :)

Thanks a lot guys!

PS: I'm in the process of *improving* my life, and once I get to a point where I feel healthy as far as weight + lifestyle I'll start getting myself some fancy new clothes to match that.

EDIT:  I just noticed in the last set my collar is on the inside of my sweater on one side, sorry about that =\"

I went back to college at 40, got my B.S. at 45. My former career was as a musician and I always kind of felt like I was too ""creative"" to be a ""real"" scientist. I graduated with high honors, got scholarships and awards, but attributed all that that to just having the follow-through-it-ness of an empty-nest mom on a mission.

Genetics always fascinated me. I did my internship at a genetics testing place with some intimidatingly smart, admirable women doctors. I discovered that I had a knack for karyotyping (organizing chromosomes by sight). I mean, c'mon...moms know how to organize things, right? My creativeness was actually really helpful for the pattern recognition needed to sort out chromosomes- a skill I possessed that they said they had never seen the likes of. 

Fast-forward five years. Out of nowhere, they contacted me. I met with them this week and they told me that I was the best intern they ever had! When they recently lost a full-timer, my name came up. After 5 years and many many other interns, they wanted ME to fill the position doing tissue culture and karyotyping. I could just pee. It's everything I worked for. They are eager to teach me as much about genetics as I am willing to learn. I will learn ALL THE THINGS! Best week ever. I am closing in on 50 and I have a new career and I actually feel like I am a real scientist! Moral of this story, you are NEVER too old.

qq960,1,2012-03-10,I told her I couldn't do it anymore...,JSlasha88,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/qq960/i_told_her_i_couldnt_do_it_anymore/,"So, long story short, I met a girl back home in Upstate NY last November, and we fell for each other pretty fast despite being from pretty different backgrounds and viewpoints on a lot of things. Around mid-December I got offered an amazing nine-month internship with a professional sports team in FL, something that I knew I couldn't pass up, because it could give me an actual real job and career sometime down the road.

So basically we tried the long-distance thing, but after two months, I couldn't take it anymore. The problem? She pretty much smothered me. We did everything you'd think would help - FaceTiming pretty much every night, texting/emailing during the day. The issue was that she doesn't have a lot going on in her life outside of a boring job, so she wanted to text and email me ALL day long. I was pretty much giving her the play-by-play of my life from 1300 miles away, and I got tired of it. She would get antsy if she didn't hear back immediately from me, and would usually jump to horrible conclusions and assume the worst. For example, if we were texting and all of a sudden my parents called and I didn't get back to her for 30 minutes, she would send me like 3 more texts asking what I was doing and if I didn't want to talk anymore.

I guess the bottom line was that this whole thing down here is like a big new adventure for me, and I'm working like 60-70 hours per week, which gives a very tiny amount of free time at the end of the day. And I just got to a point where I couldn't justify spending all that free time in constant communication with her. I felt like I was constantly answering to her.

Of course, I tried to explain this to her and logically spell out why we needed to slow it down, but she was like...1000mph running on emotions, and of course was unable to process my very well-explained, rational opinion.

Has anyone else ever felt like this? I feel really bad for ending it, but my heart just wasn't in it anymore.

TL/DR: My long-distance girl, who I had casually dated for two months prior to moving, smothered me by being extremely insecure and needy.

He didn't really have anything more for me to do, so I generally ended my work in a hour and a half, only to wait three more hours staring at a blank screen before I could go home.

It was my first experience similar to a job and I needed to do it to graduate, so at first I was very rule-abiding and strict and I never used my free time to browse facebook or things like that. However after a while I couldn't stand the idea of wasting so much time doing nothing or, worse, spamming.

The final straw came when I realized that at one point he even had started monitoring me with a software. I wasn't 100% sure about it, but from a moment on he started appearing in the room I worked the exact time when I ended my spam-routine just to boast about his site and his Google knowledge.

I wanted to prove it but I didn't want to be rebuked, so I had to trap him in his own game. I started thinking and then I realized that he previously owned the laptop on which I had to work on, so I immediately did the most obvious file research I could do: *.avi

Without effort I found at least two porn movies in different buried folders: I proceeded to email myself a screenshot and then to play a nasty porn flick on the laptop with the speakers muted.

A millisecond after that I heard him walking in the corridor, so I shut the window. He appeared in my room, stared at me and told just this: ""You scare me"". I then answered as naively as I could ""Well, why?"". He went back to his office.

The next day he moved my workplace in his office. We never talked about what happened, and at first I was exhilarated, but after a couple of years I still feel bad about what I did (but not so much, since he gave me a pc he used to jack off).

For me, it was the stark difference between how I was treated during my internship versus my second job. During my last summer I had an internship working at the university greenhouse. I accidentally cut my leg while carrying a rusty garbage can, and figured it would be sensible to tell my boss. The rest of the day was spent filling out paperwork and talking on the phone with some health people at the university. Got a teatnus the next day. It seemed like overkill, but not a big deal.

For $10/hour I currently get paid to do something easy with a computer in a temperature controlled office with coffee and purified water. I was paid for my training. This is my third job since graduation. I've been out of school for about 18 months. My first and second jobs were in pest control.

First paid $13.50/hour, paid for my training and certification, and was going to get a raise and my own truck to drive. Moved to a new city, got another job paying $10/hour, same as the desk job. Same city, too. I ask my boss if he's gonna cover my transportation costs. Maybe a few months down the line. My on the job training time would not be paid for, nor would my pesticide training and liscensure in that state. I worked for him two weeks. Last day I work for him I end up soaking my uniform in sweat because of how hot it is in this ancient asbestos and rat shit filled boiler room I had to clean. The people at the building give me a cheap mask, gloves, and a shell to wear over my clothes. I did not know there was asbestos before cleaning it. I come back to report to him, extremely thirsty because there is no water fountain on his floor. I drink two bottles of water from the minifridge in the office, and he chews me out because those were provided by one of the office ladies. I thank her for those. I am still dizzy from the boiler room. He had been saying he was looking to hire someone for a managerial position, and that's when I realized I care less about pay than I do about comfort. He still owes me my last paycheck.

Epologue: I'm very happy getting paid very little to do something pointless in front of a computer for 8 hours a day. If only they'd give me health insurance..."

I have, what I believe, is a great idea for a company, and work model, which benefits the greater good. [As a taste, a mock-up ad I created touts, in a nut shell, what I'm proposing.](http://i.imgur.com/THs9Z.png) Almost makes me feel I should post it in OWS instead.

Basically, my idea is that I develop inventions of mine, my friends, the general public, and students' from my local university into products which are easy to assemble. I then open facilities 24/7 in areas of high foot traffic and high unemployment where passer-by's, homeless, or anybody interested, can walk inside and choose to assemble these products. Within an hour of walking in, they're registered to work, trained how to build a product, and assembling. Employees would earn a set amount per product assembled, on average $10/hr, or more if they assemble faster. Earn is collected same-day when leaving, and for helping fellow workers, or other well-intentioned acts, they would earn Kharma, which is redeemable for free services (meals, gym, laundry, entertainment, medical advice, ...). 

Most importantly, I see this model offering a homeless, unemployed person a shower, change of clothes, meal and source of income with no interview, resume, or judgement necessary. 

Additionally, the originator of any invention, and any student interns who worked on it would receive a portion of the profit from each sale. It sounds like a good idea in my mind, but I realize building such a facility, or multiple of them, would be incredibly expensive. My question to Reddit is how could I fund such a well-intentioned company?

Are there grants, particular investors, or any great sources I should look at?

----

**TL;DR; I want to create tons of jobs by allowing anybody to walk in and assemble products, which my company designs, on a per-product-built basis. I also want to offer free services in return for good acts. How me fund this?**

I followed the doctors advice, putting on about 8-9 pounds in the process. Now I am back on keto for a 1.5 weeks and I just don't seem to be losing much.

**Description**

Solo show with Patrick today – kind of an inside baseball show. As one caller says, the show is all talk about food and fans. But sometimes that’s what you people need. More Anjeli Jana bashing, more calls from fans, good and bad, and we learn something about what Armenian people eat. One caller calls in to bitch. Patrick is upset about people who pretend to want to help. We talk about upcoming Texas and New York City meetups and shows. Creepy Bill from MN proves why he will never be an intern for the show, despite his undying dedication.

qprjn,42,2012-03-09,"Invisible Children CEO, Ben Keesey",QuestioningKony,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qprjn/invisible_children_ceo_ben_keesey/,"Let me preface all of this by saying, I've never given much stock to conspiracy theories as a whole. Many of them require such intricate machinations that I don't think they could be covered up for so long, or would require more competence from more people than I'm willing to credit the human race with.

That said, the past day or so, it's like I've been pulled into a rabbit hole, and little bits and pieces of things I've seen lately are starting to create an ominous picture. And the scariest part (to me) is that it doesn't require that complex of a scheme... at all...

Alright, I really have a strong intuition that this Kony 2012 thing is a distraction for some bigger story. We all know that there have been some very suspicious [FBI actions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXi-oDoMQhc) and [TSA actions](http://tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com/2012/03/08/breaking-tsa-threatens-mainstream-media-not-to-cover-story/) in the past few days. But I really feel like there's a major cover-up going on with this ""campaign."" At first, I felt like it might be a political candidate trying to draw attention away from Super-Tuesday or something moderately tame like that.

Unfortunately, I'm starting to feel like that would be... er... simpler than the real story. Although the political aspect of calling it ""Kony 2012"" and releasing it on Super-Tuesday (technically it was released Monday) have a strong psychological effect (it's essentially using very basic priming to get it stuck in their heads), I now truly think that that timing is ONLY to use that priming.

Without going into all of the criticism of Invisible Children (which are numerous and mostly valid... though I will maintain that there's at least an argument that the ""filmmaking budget,"" while separate from the program budgets, could be considered a ""program"" because it's raising awareness... I'm not sure that that argument is strictly ethically *correct*, but nonetheless...), I'm very interested in one person in particular.

**Ben Keesey**

Keesey is the Executive Director and CEO of IC. What first drew me to start looking into him was that he IS the top of the company, yet I haven't seen his name in ANY of the media rebuttals. So, I started poking around publicly available records on the internet.

At first, I had no idea what I was looking for. I tried to find any tie between the FBI and Keesey or IC. I couldn't turn up a direct connection, but then I found something rather startling on [Keesey's Link'dIn page](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-keesey/4/b19/24a). He leap frogs from an investment banking company, to a management consultant firm, straight to IC. It's not an entirely unexpected career path, but it's a bit unusual to move into a high-capital non-profit after a couple internships and to build it up in less than five years.

My working theory is that Keesey made some connection at [Brentwood](http://www.brentwood.com/) that took him to [Deloitte](http://www.deloitte.com/) (which does some high up business in Africa... a brief search turned up [this](http://www.techzim.co.zw/tag/deloitte/)... granted it's Zimbabwe and not Uganda, and that they're not really even that close... but I don't remember if I heard that the LRA had been in Zimbabwe or something...) which set up IC as a media front for some of their less scrupulous actions. Granted, it's only intuition and a working theory.

Here's where I need /r/Conspiracy. I need help to sort out all this information, to follow the thread and see if it leads somewhere. I keep coming back to the word ""Evangelical"" too... If Keesey has a connection, I strongly feel it will be church/evangelical related. I'm not so good at all this, but it's your bread and butter. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but better to be proven wrong than to have never said anything at all."

I'm originally from the East Coast (Binghampton / New York City) but I've been living in Portland, OR for the past 16 years. I'm currently in my senior year of college pursuing a Communication Design degree from the Pacific Northwest College of Art.

My rent in Portland is cheap ($318 a month) so I'll have about $700 dollars monthly even after paying my Portland rent. I'm used to living exceptionally frugally, so I'm not super concerned about whether or not the internship is paid.. I just want to make sure it's valuable experience.

I'm familiar with the ad agencies and design houses in Portland, and I have a lot of options here, but being offered free housing in Boston, a city where I'm in close proximity to all of my extended family (0% of my family lives on the West Coast), isn't something worth throwing away as an option.

One thing that I noted was that Perls stated, and was recorded doing so, extinguishing a phobia in a single session. As someone who has specialized in anxiety disorders and phobias this piqued my interest. Especially since there is an experiential component to gestalt therapy, and in truth, all phobia protocols. What if the phobia overlaps certain social/personal/ethical boundaries?

Personally, I have never experienced a clinical case of fear of being naked, I think most people believe it is par for the course, and thus never seek treatment. So this made me curious, how would one go about extinguishing such a phobia in a clinical setting were a client to ask for help? Would it be more homework based, or does this ethically fall under ""therapeutic contact"" with a client in the case of being present during systematic desensitization, flooding, etc.? Obviously there would be some significant talk therapy prior to engaging in in vivo exercises, but what happens then? Would the common S.D. schedules just have to be tossed out the window entirely?

Just to clarify, Im not treating anyone with this condition currently, and this post is strictly academic in nature. I've just never come across this type of ethical/treatment question before and it made me curious. Im open to all responses, from fellow clinicians and laypeople alike."

I am currently depressed.  Let me explain how I fell into the underbelly of darkness.  

In May 2008, I moved back into my parent's house from college.  I decided that it was for the best to save money, and I had an internship.  I had recently gained a bit of weight because I was unhappy in a relationship.  Eventually we broke up, and this coincided with me moving back into my parent's house.  I decided to diet to lose the weight.  My mother was more than thrilled to help me.  We cooked together, and I started going to the gym more often.  I asked her to help me.  But it started becoming demeaning when she would walk into the living room, and ask why I wasn't at the gym.  I felt worse when one day, she became angry when I ate too many frozen raspberries after dinner.  I continued seeing my friends at this point, which meant that I ate with them.  I remember becoming upset why I wasn't losing weight at a quicker pace, when my mom pointed out that my friends were not exactly the healthiest eaters.  She recommended that I stop seeing them because I would continue my old habits with them.

After a few months, I lost a dramatic amount of weight.  I went to the gym more frequently.  My diet became much more restricted and then I decided it was time to cut down my portions.  My mom laughed at me when I cut my food portions in half, and called me her little rabbit.  In response, I said ""Don't fuck with me.  Whenever I am in the kitchen, no one can enter"".  Then on, my parents obeyed this rule.  

The last time I hung out with one of my friends from high school, she called me ""skinny bitch"" the whole time.  Some of my friends did not accept me for being thinner.  I did what my Mom suggested.  Goodbye socialization! 

In the meanwhile, I was losing more and more weight.  In November, I reached 105 lbs.  I am 5' 7.5"".  I am female, and this was not my lowest adult weight.  

From 2008 to September 2011, I was anorexic.  I learned all of the tricks to not let anyone know.  I did not spend more than a few hours at a time with anyone.  I did not like eating with people, and tried to avoid it as much as possible.  I went to the gym for 2 hours everyday.  

One of the worst points came in 2010 when my sister's family came to visit.  I was reclusive.  I had locks installed on my office and bedroom doors so I could hide food in the trash.  I told everyone I was vegetarian so I couldn't eat with them.  

During 2008-2011, my Mom talked to me a few times saying that I was a little underweight, and it would be okay if I gained a bit of weight.  But at the same time, she told me that ""while you can always get a job, you have one body and you take care of it.  Men only like women who take care of themselves.  Look at how may fat girls there are.  Men don't want them.""  She added fuel to my fire.  I also remember Christmas 2008 when I was supposed to go to my family dinner.  I protested that the dinner food did not agreed with my diet, and my Mom's response was ""act like model.  Push around your peas, and talk a lot"".  I did not go, and neither did my parents.  The last time I ate a family meal was 2008.  During my anorexia, my Mom bought my food.  I gave her shopping lists and demanded that she buy crazy amounts for fruits and vegetables (the majority of my diet) so I would always have extras stocked in the house.  And she did.  She was so proud that I was skinny and told me that I was special because there are many girls like me.  She said I should consider modelling.

I feel angry at myself more than anything for spiraling into crazzzzziness.  I feel angry at my Mom. My Dad was not any better... during the summer of 2011 he used to torment me.  He would always yell at me ""did you remember to eat up?"" or ""did you eat?"" or ""are you anorexic?"" when I left for the gym.

In spring 2011, I went to the extreme.  I estimate my lowest weight at around 85 lbs.  I had a person in the street yell at me ""eat something girl!"".  My gym demanded that I retrieve a doctor's note.  I did and the note said I was okay for moderate exercise.  My gym demanded that I get another doctor's note saying that I could do regular intense exercise.  I got another note.  My manager at work called a meeting with HR and me to discuss my weight loss.  He wanted me to get help.  However it was a contract job that ended 1 month after that meeting.  Afterwards, I decided I wanted my life back.  I stopped doing activities which I loved.  I decided to move away, and I did.  

Fast forward about 6 months to now, when I tried to recover I got a new eating disorder: binge eating!  I am now overweight.  At times, I am suicidal.  I want a normal fulfilling life but I do not know if it's in the cards for me.  When I started eating again, a flood of emotions came over me.  I realized that no one really gives a fuck about me.  As long as I do a good job at work, no one knows my secret.  They think I am normal.  I used to be a great person.  Now, I'm nada.  No one will ever love me for who I am.  Because there is nothing left.  My parents and my sister, the closest people to me, I do not respect anymore.  I am afraid that I am going to become old, and even with all of my freedom and financial independence, I will never be happy.  I don't how I will ever have a boyfriend again.  I haven't worn a tank top in public since 2008.  (The last time I did I remember the disgusted faces in the gym).  My body issues are so bad that I can't stand it when people touch me.  When I was skinny, my guy friend rated me a 9.5.  Now, I'm probably a 5.  I like to say that looks do not matter, and I want to believe it so badly but I can't.  People treated me so differently when I was skinny.       

I want to believe that I can get better, but it's hard when I feel so unloved.  And I live on my own, and I need some help installing a few things in my apartment but I hate being in private places with others so I haven't received the help that I need.

Like I said earlier, I am pretty depressed.  The only high point in my life is my career.  I am amazed at how I compartmentalize my successful work life with my shitty personal life.  I am seeing a therapist once a week after work.  I am trying, but deep down I feel that I do not deserve love.  That I am invalid because I am fat (which I have never been in my life up until now).

And why I am posting this online?  Because it feels good to tell the story as a cautionary tale.  Because I am desperately seeking hope. Because the only other person that knows this story is my therapist.  

One day, I want to be honest. I want a close friend.  I want to trust them with the truth.    

Has anyone reading this experienced something similar? "

“The expanded line of products,” Harris said,“can be controlled through either the internet or a mobile app.” The new products include smart locks for doors, web controlled thermostats, and surveillance cameras to monitor home activities.

“These products make life safer and more convenient,” said Harris.“Total home control allows homeowners to check on their home and family while they are away.”

Harris added that the products will be available to over 25 million homeowners this summer, exclusively through its grass roots door to door program.

“Our student advertising internship will do in-home presentations of these products starting April 1 through October 1,” said Ryan Roche, Vision Security internship director.“Homeowners in our 9 selected markets can expect a Vision Security student intern to knock their door this summer to offer them these products.”

Rob Harris stressed that he’s excited about the new line of products, because they provide homeowners with a variety of benefits.

“It makes it possible for homeowners to interact with their home while they are on the go,” Rob Harris said.“Homeowners can receive texts and email alerts directly from their home. They can also save money on their utilities by adjusting their thermostats they are while away. They can even lock their doors, turn lights on, and view their video cameras right from their smart phone or any internet connection in the world.”

qry8f,3,2012-03-11,Advice Needed on Job Offer Etiquette,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/qry8f/advice_needed_on_job_offer_etiquette/,"Hello fellow engineering redditors, I'm a senior graduating this semester with my BSE and am going through the whole job searching process.  
  
  
I've recently been offered a position at the small company that I'm interning at and while I'm glad I interned there and I think working there would be fine, the problem kind of is that working there would be just fine - not my dream or ideal job fresh out of school. They have offered me a position and would like my reply by then end of this next week. Meanwhile, the other companies I've been applying to haven't even begun their hiring process (no calls to me - no calls to anybody I have talked to in my major/courses).  
  
  
The offer I have at this point is good and it's well, an offer as opposed to not even an interview. My issue is what I'm to do next. As far as I know now, there are three options:  
* Take the job, stop looking for other jobs. The economy is not amazing. If I was a stellar candidate other companies would have already  been in contact with me. It is unethical to sign an acceptance letter and continue to look for another position.  
* Take the job, keep looking. I live in an at-will state and am free to choose what is best for me. I can rescind my acceptance courteously and although the company will not be happy, there's not much they can do about it.  
* Refuse the job. Hopefully with an engineering degree this wouldn't be my only job offer. I wouldn't become homeless if I were to be unemployed for awhile and I'm a professional and cannot make commitments I can't keep.  
  
  
Some background on me is that I don't have much experience, this internship is pretty much it. My GPA is between a 3.0 and 3.25. Decent but not impressive. There is another intern at this company that I'm sure the company would switch to in a heartbeat if I didn't seem interested.  
  
  
I wish I could just ask for more time but I feel like this would reflect really badly and they would just go with the other intern (there's only one position). I like to hold myself to a high standard ethically and would hate to back out of the contract but it's extremely hard to pass up a sure thing. 
  
  
Please help me out and state your opinion on the matter and what you feel you would do in this position. Thanks for reading and let me know if I left anything out (or feel free to gripe at me for giving too much info)!"

One thing that I noted was that Perls stated, and was recorded doing so, extinguishing a phobia in a single session. As someone who has specialized in anxiety disorders and phobias this piqued my interest. Especially since there is an experiential component to gestalt therapy, and in truth, all phobia protocols. What if the phobia overlaps certain social boundaries?

Personally, I have never experienced a clinical case of fear of being naked, I think most people believe it is par for the course, and thus never seek treatment. So this made me curious, how would one go about extinguishing such a phobia in a clinical setting were a client to ask for help? Would it be more homework based, or does this ethically fall under ""therapeutic contact"" with a client in the case of being present during systematic desensitization, flooding, etc.? Obviously there would be some significant talk therapy prior to engaging in in vivo exercises, but what happens then? Would the common S.D. schedules just have to be tossed out the window entirely?

Just to clarify, Im not treating anyone with this condition currently, and this post is strictly academic in nature. I've just never come across this type of ethical/treatment question before and it made me curious. Im open to all responses, from fellow clinicians and laypeople alike."

Here's my situation, I really need help guys. I need to get motivated in school. I'm a 3rd year accounting student and I'm not acting like one. In the past year, my gpa has dropped from ~3.8 to 3.45 and I **do not** want that shit to drop any more, my goal is to graduate with higher than a 3.5. Over the pat year I've become so fucking unmotivated I just hate myself. I've started smoking a lot of weed which I feel gets in the way of my academic success. I have no idea what the fuck is wrong with me, I used to be disciplined and used to get whatever shit to be done, done. Now I just procrastinate like a bitch and it's really screwing me over. To be clear, my college is about 25 minutes away so I commute. I have no friends few friends at college that I never hand out with so I'm at home most of the time and I've filled that void with pot. 

I'm taking the hardest accounting class of my life and I've not started studying for my huge midterm on wednesday. The class is comprised of 2 midterms and a paper and I'm probably going to get a D or an F on the test this wednesday which will probably cause me to fail the class. Something is wrong with me. My sleep schedule is fucked up, I'm always tired, I don't give a shit about anything including school when I really should at this moment in my life. I need to start applying to internships and such but I just haven't brought myself up to do it. I don't know how to cut my weed habit, which I think is the problem. One of my friends who is a daily toker has one of the highest gpa's in the school and he's doing just great for himself, but me, I'm fucking up. This is the first time I've admitted my problems and I'm scared to even talk to my parents about it. I won't tell them about the weed, but I just feel like shit on a daily basis and have no idea where my life is heading. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this so I made a post on this subreddit because I feel I can talk to you guys about this. I'm starting to hate what ~~I'm becoming~~ I've become and I need to change my ways if I don't want to be left behind in the future. "
qrpr0,1,2012-03-11,Done being nice. I only get shit for it.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/qrpr0/done_being_nice_i_only_get_shit_for_it/,"This pretty much sums up what has been going on the past few weeks. I have been nothing but nice to people, and I just end up getting shit for it...

Before I start this story, I would like to mention that my boyfriend and I run in many of the same circles. We were friends for a while first, which is why we share a lot of friends. Neither one of us is is particularly touchy in public (if you did not know we were dating you would never guess, we've had people ask us because they weren't sure).

The two most stinging examples:

Friend #1, close friend who has also been friends with my boyfriend for many years:

- I invite him on vacation with us with free accommodations (My family owns property near ski mountain, it is sad to go alone so we invite a bunch of friends), tell him he can invite friends.

- Sometimes front money when we decide to go out (I still have not been paid back for the last time).

- Listen to his problems without judging.

- When his xbox and games got stolen (renter's insurance covered most of it), my boyfriend and I bought him games to make up for the ones he lost.

- Helped him work on his car when he needed it.

What I have gotten for it:

- He complained that the games we got him were used and not Forza 4. We never promised to buy him Forza 4 (We got Forza 3 and Saint's Row 2) and neither of us is swimming in cash.

- Ditched.

- Pretty much told both my boyfriend and I that he won't be hanging out with either of us, or any of his old friends, because some fucktard called him a faggot for hanging out with mostly guys. (I am female, I just 'don't count' in many circles of friends).

- Told that both my boyfriend and I did not respect his boundaries. He contacts us more than we contact him. We go to college roughly an hour and a half away, we only see him a couple times a month tops (when we visit home).

Friend #2, one of my boyfriend's roommates:

- I listen to his shit problems in regards to his girlfriend dumping him/His friend's parents kicking him out of their house/Not having an internship etc.

- I offered him a couch to sleep on during spring break if he needed it.

- I have driven him around a few times (he does not have a license).

What I have gotten for it:

- He uses any opportunity where we disagree, to act as though I am some sort of raging moron. I find this idiotic because I am a few years younger and more educated than he is (he'll have his B.S. at 23-24, I'll have my M.S. at 21-22), and I don't rub it in or try to make him feel stupid. 

There have been many examples of situations where I have been nice to people and only had it thrown back at me. I just find it more hurtful coming from friends. I have been depressed for a few months thanks to these issues, and unfortunately for others, it seems to be pushing me towards behavior I thought I matured out of.

I guess I'm going to start being an asshole again. People treated me better and I had more friends when I did. Long gone are the days where I would stop everything to help a fellow friend. I'm going back to the behavior where I called people on their shit, didn't help out as much, and caused some genuine psychological damage when people wronged me.

Background 
--

---

I started college with no real goals or knowledge as to what I wanted to do. I love computer science and programming, so I started a degree at Lawrence Technological University in Michigan for Computer Science and Mathematics, but a life tragedy happened at the end of my first semester in college and I never really picked myself up.

Now after 3 years of basically sitting in the back of the classroom listening and not really participating I've decided that my programming hobby isn't going to make a very enjoyable career and I want to take what I've learned so far and steer that down the path to become an actuary.

My friend recommended this profession based on the fact that he had come down a similar path and even completed a degree in Mathematics at LTU. The degree itself is essentially worthless which has me gritting my teeth at how stupid I was as a youth to just blindly follow a high school friend to this expensive shill.

Foreground
--

---

Being a third year I have most of my mathematics done. I stopped at partial differential equations because at that point I didn't even know why I was getting out of bed in the morning.

What I really want to do is find a university that I can study to get into this summer or fall, but my GPA is a miserable 2.4 (I think) and no university will probably accept that. I can probably go to a community college to start some college level financial classes, but I don't really know what I'll need to complete a degree with my accumulated 52 credit hours as it stands.

I've disowned the university, but I'm open to completing the degree there if that is my only choice. It is very expensive and I really cannot afford to go there anymore (10k per semester).

I don't know of any universities with actuary programs near me, but I'm willing to relocate to finish school. I have a job and I'm sure I can find another one if I need to relocate.

So any advice?

---

I want to thank everyone for giving me their opinions.

So now I have compiled a list of what I will try to do:

* Finish major in comp sci and started on exams.
* Market myself for IT work and do some data mining.
* Figure out how internships and scholarships work."

I have zero pharmacy experience except for a Summer community rotation I did last year for 1 month (and I have 2 references from that, I did well at it). I guess the problem is that I didn't really start trying to find a job as an intern until the beginning of the year, and nowhere around me (out of like 10-15 pharmacies) seems to have any openings. What do Reddit? I've set my max driving distance at ~20 minutes because my car is somewhat shoddy, but I'm starting to worry about A) my funds in between loans and B) gaining enough hours for the boards. I did college for 4 years and then worked research in a lab (non-pharmacy research) for two years. So I have ""science"" experience but no pharmacy experience save that internship. :/

To clarify, I usually fill out the application, call them up a week later 1-2 times, and always just get told that they don't have any openings and/or the position has been filled (mostly there wasn't an opening to begin with). I dunno man. I've tried retail settings, hospital settings, and independents in my area. I'm starting to get a bit worried. I guess the next step is to look at pharmacies where I'll have to drive ~45 mins to get to...

Edit: This is probably relevant, but I'm a decent/well-kept guy, I think I am charismatic and well-groomed, and I am down-to-earth and have a good sense of humor. I just wanted to put out there I'm not some d-bag or something that thinks he is all high-and-mighty. I'm always very polite during interviews and whatnot and usually just try to express how I learn quickly and have a good work ethic. Anyway, thanks for any help anyone can give me. I know I don't seem to have many options. Also, I think I have pretty good people skills and during our counseling practices, I think I do pretty well.

Coming into this game, I saw a tremendous opportunity for a thriving community of journalists in this shardless, persistent world. However, I soon came to realise that while Eve Online did indeed have a very active offline community in which players shared their experiences and opinions, there was no real centralised source of unbiased and informative news. The IC team of the ISD program seems to be pretty much dead. Even Eve News24, a site which claimed to be a source of ""news"" seemed to be more of an aggregator tabloid of Eve related articles and less of a source of news coverage by active journalism. I found that finding sources of up to date information relevant to your interest was quite difficult if you were not already in ""the loop"", so to speak. For example, new players and players who do not participate in Sov Warfare have very limited access to news about what goes on in Null Sec. While battle reports and such do exist to a certain extent, for the most part they describe the events that transpired without providing any context, images or sources. I understand that Eve has a high entry barrier, but I believe the lack of available information on what goes on outside our personal playing experiences limits our scope and immersion in the game. 

This is why I would like to see if anyone would be interested in a project to create a centralized source of news and opinion for all things Eve. This means placing correspondents in all aspects of Eve Online, from WHs to Sov to Trading to Piracy, and writing articles from our own gameplay experiences as well as that of others. This means maintaining complete political neutrality and forging diplomatic relations with major alliances so that we can provide news coverage on what goes on in Null Sec. This means getting people with high end computers to go out as a ""cameraman"" taking screenshots and footage to provide visual context to accompany the text, and editors who piece everything to make a well presented news article that is engaging and informative.  It's extremely ambitious, I know.

While I consider myself to have some grasp on the concept of news production, I admit that I have relatively very little knowledge on topics such as web design, website management and even Eve Online. This project is mostly a concept and I don't believe that all of what I propose here is plausible, nor that I have the experience necessary to manage such a project. However I also think that this project would do a lot to expand the Eve Online community, be good fun and if successful, fucking awesome. That's why I want to hear what you guys think of such a project, and any suggestions that you may have. 

I've also created a New Eden Chronicle subreddit [/r/nechronicle](http://www.reddit.com/r/nechronicle/) in case anyone is interested in starting up discussions on the topic.

I no longer drink but have replaced my lithium with weed just so I do not have to deal with the nausea and other side effects.   I am stuck between missing the crazy impulses, and being a mature college student about to enter my masters degree in business.  I do not know how to move on make new friends and find people to confide in.  I do have a boyfriend of 2 years, and I love him (though marriage is illegal due to the gay thing).  However, I feel that my growing anti-social reluctance to trust anyone enough to start a friendship is effecting him also.  Just need some advice I suppose. (sorry for the rambling)"

qtk48,3,2012-03-12,I'm an international student in graduate school. I don't understand American working ethics and etiquette.,chineseinamerica,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qtk48/im_an_international_student_in_graduate_school_i/,"I'm an international student from China. Now I'm in a top 40 American university to get a master's degree. Unlike many Chinese students I really want to find a job and stay here. However it is extremely hard for me due to my identity. I don't have a green card so I need visa sponsorship. I have a 4.0 GPA and work as a Teaching Assitant, which means I do well academically and am competent in my field.  However while my American classmate ( yeah I have only one American classmate, all the rest are Indians and Chinese) landed a job at the middle of the first semester, I'm still not able to find an internship like the rest of my international classmates. 

I accept the fact that getting a job will be very difficult for me. I work very hard to network. But things are just so frustrating. 

For example:

I signed up for a case competition last winter because I would have a chance to team up with local business professionals and present our work together. I was chosen as one of the five students and was assigned to a team with 4 Americans working for a bank. I stayed home during the whole winter break and prepared for the case. I waited and waited but none of them proposed to meet during the whole winter. So 10 days before the final contest I eventually got them together and had our first meeting. The meeting went well as far as I thought. What I didn't expect was that  one of them vanished. She stopped replying to emails or picking up phone calls. Anther one said she couldn't come to the second meeting or the final contest because of some personal things to attend. So there were only one teammate and me. Eventually he decided to pull out too. I was dumbfounded by their irresponsibility. I feel like I spent my whole winter break for nothing. Is it normal for Americans get to quit whenever they want to without thinking about the inconvenience they could bring to others? 

Another example:

So I was at a career fair last month. Like people do at most career fairs, I handed out some resumes and wish someone would give me a call, which never happened before by the way. They usually lose interest when they know I'm a Chinese citizen. However this time I did get a call from a fortune 500 company. The guy called me to arrange an interview between March 15 and 19. It was in Feb at the time and I have my spring break bewtween March 12 to 19. So I told that person that if it's ok to call him later when I finalize my schedule. He said okay and he'd give me a call after his vacation (He was going on a vacation.) So I waited for his call but he never called again. I thought well he was still on vacation because I gave him calls everyday but no one picked the phone. Finally he picked up his phone this morning and told me he already interviewed people and he didn't plan on interviewing me anymore........ Okay, this is probably my fault for being indecisive when he first called to arrange an interview. But can't he just tell me the truth that if I don't get him a date then there will be no interview anymore? Also, he planned on interview me on a day between 15 and 19 and today is 12. So it's not like I called him after 19. I'm really confused about this one. Is it my fault on this one?

The last thing:

American guys are very inappropriate sometimes. When I got my TA job, one of my American firends was like ""your professor must have a boner for you."" Or they would say "" just marry someone to get a green card so you can stay."" I know they are joking with me but I do feel uncomfortable. 

Okay, my rant is over. Please forgive me for grammar mistakes.

I've been in love with music since forever, and 2 years ago I moved to Seattle and found an audio program that I liked at a local community college.

A couple months ago I started recording and doing live sound 2 nights a week for free at a local jazz club, then doing coarse mixes of each live set (3 hours+ audio) on a 48 hour turnaround.  After one evening's set, one of the players gave me his business card and told me he owns a studio and might be looking for an intern.  I followed up, and a couple meetings later he agreed to take me on.  His studio's business is about 50/50 music/voiceover, and it was mentioned off-hand that once I'm no longer an intern the way my boss envisioned it was I would pull clients in and work with them at his studio independently of the work he does at his studio, and just pay him rent for his space/equipment on each session while I could charge whatever additional I want.

I was just hoping maybe someone could offer some guidance to me; lately I've been doing a lot of stuff for free, because I can afford it while I go to school, but that won't be the case for long.  I want to build a career out of audio, and more specifically musical audio.  What opportunities should I be keeping an eye out for, which should I be nurturing?  Anything you wish you'd known?"
qthqx,4,2012-03-12,Need some advice on choosing between firm and PTO internship for 1L year.,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/qthqx/need_some_advice_on_choosing_between_firm_and_pto/,"Hi [/r/LawSchool](/r/LawSchool). I have an internship situation that I have been asking tons of people about, but it only just occurred to me to ask reddit. I ask it about computer hardware and video games, so what the hell, why not about law school?

Basically, I have 2 offers for a summer internship. One is at a firm that does only patent prosecution and litigation (I would probably be doing mostly prosecution), and the other is at the PTO. The firm is around 40 people, and they seem to have a decent reputation.

So far, the advice I have gotten has been a really mixed bag. The firm people have generally recommended the firm, and the PTO people have generally recommended the PTO. Very few people said one was massively better than the other. 

Right now,  I'm pretty much 99% PTO. I actually applied there when I got out of college, but that was smack dab in the middle of the hiring freeze, so I was SOL and decided to go to Law School. I'm more interested in seeing how it operates than I am with the firm, and more people have said that I would probably get better training and mentorship at the PTO than the firm (I hear from an alum that works there that they're not always available to help or answer questions depending on their workload), which I think is important to me as a 1L who will go in with only 1 IP course under his belt.

Additionally, even though I don't actually have experience in either, the associate lifestyle doesn't seem like my kind of thing. I'm a pretty laid back guy who isn't very ambitious and isn't out to make $250k+ (I know, why the fuck am I in law school, right?), and I like the structured advancement and security that the PTO seems to offer. Right now, I definitely considering it for a career when I get out of school, and I've been told that getting an internship there can help with that, even if you already know some people on the inside.

My plan right now is to go PTO this year, and then do a firm (hopefully) my 2L year. People say that the 2L summer is more important anyway, so I would like to do what I'm more interested in now, even if it might not look as stellar on a resume (and I'm not even sure that it won't). I still would like to get some more opinions on it though, especially from people who may have recently gone through the same thing."

So I have been out of work for about 2 years. Before this I was a journeyman carpenter in Las Vegas. Work dried up pretty bad and now I'm living in southern Oregon with some friends who have been very gracious with me. I had a good amount of money saved up, but it's been gone a while.

A few problems I may be having are the lack of an in state driver's licence. I am working on getting a birth certificate so I can get a new drivers license. My references are probably terrible in that I doubt any of them are even reachable. The construction industry got tore up pretty bad and most of my contacts have been fired or layed-off and no longer have company phones. 

I don't have good relationship skills, so that has hurt me a lot. I moved around growing up between parents and just didn't really understand the benefits of keeping in contact with friends and coworkers that would put in a good word for me.

Before that I worked at a automotive supplier as a part of an internship in college for mechanical engineering. I only completed a year of that before I had to drop out for financial reasons.

I need to get on track and gain a reliable source of income. I fear I am on the verge of homelessness and more bad news in general.

I am pretty computer savvy, always work hard and have always had employers that were very happy with me. I just don't know what to do to get started again.

Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated. I will try to answer any questions if anyone has any.

qt8rw,2,2012-03-12,"Aspiring Musician/Audio Engineer in CA, should I move to Ann Arbor, MI?",creatoranddistractor,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qt8rw/aspiring_musicianaudio_engineer_in_ca_should_i/,"Hi guys, I'm having a tough time coming to a big decision affecting my life, relationship and career, and thought maybe someone here might have some wise insight. I am really at a loss as to what to do. Do any of you live in or near Ann Arbor, MI? 

A little backstory, my girlfriend of 5+ years and I are both 26 and live in San Diego CA. She's applied to a number of graduate schools, including UC Berkeley, The New School (NY), American University (DC), University of Washington (Seattle), and University of Michigan. She's studying International Sustainable Agricultural Development, and all these schools have good programs related to this field.  I am a musician/music producer whose career is just starting to materialize...my band just released [this] (http://creatoranddistractor.bandcamp.com) and I cowrote/produced a song for  [My Drunk Kitchen's Hannah Hart](http://youtu.be/mafimBTMTmY). My bandmates are based in California, and we have a number of friends in the industry here, so we have sort of an established ""home base"" in California. 

Anyway, she's starting to hear back from schools. She's been accepted to University of Michigan and American University so far. She hasn't been rejected by any schools yet, but because she heard back from these two schools first, these schools have sort of subconsiously jumped to the top of her list in her mind. She's starting to get really excited about the program at Michigan, despite the fact that when she first applied, it was at the bottom of her list, due to the high cost and its location. Suddenly now, the program at Berkeley, which used to be her top choice, doesn't look good enough to her, and the Michigan program is ""exacty what she wants"".

We agreed that we would move together to wherever she decides to attend, and to her credit, she based her application list somewhat on the music scene in and near those schools, taking my career into account. Obviously the bay area has a great scene, and is close to LA, and NYC is an obvious choice. Even Seattle and DC have pretty great scenes. Ann Arbor Michigan scares me though. I've been into music my whole life, and before she applied to UM, I'd never heard of the place. I've been looking into the music scene there, and have come up pretty empty handed. We're going to visit in a couple weeks to attend a Student's Day, so I'll do some more research there, but I'm starting to worry that the trip out there might sell her on the college and place, while simultaneously convincing me that I don't have much of a future there.

Moving to Michigan would certainly and significantly change the direction of my career. I've just started to make some meaningful connections in the industry in CA, and even have an internship at a recording studio lined up here in San Diego. If we move to Michigan, I'm afraid I'll be forced to put my music on the shelf for a while, and take any job I can get out there, just to pass the time while she earns her degree. Of course I want her to go to the best school for her, and get the degree that she truly wants, but it's starting to dawn on me that doing so may be at the expense of my own career. We've tried doing the long distance thing a couple times in the past, and it's fine for the short term, but the idea of having a 2 year long-distance relationship sounds...hard at best.

So I'm asking you, the fine populous of reddit, for advice. Does anyone live in or near Ann Arbor?  Is anyone attending UM and in the International Sustainable Development MA program? If so, how is it? What's the music scene like out there? Should I abandon my CA band (who will definitely not make the move with me to MI), to follow my girlfriend while she gets her MA? Should I stand my ground and follow the music? 

**tl;dr Should I follow my music career, or my girlfriend to graduate school? Are these mutually exclusive?**"

I have been discouraged from asking for help to write code. But my biggest issue right now is that my JavaScript knowledge is close to none. I need to make some fairly simple changes but for particular parts of the project the change needs to be made in JavaScript. I feel uncomfortable telling my manager that I'm unable to understand what is going on and how to implement it - because there is nothing ""magical"" about programming - but I'm very lost. 

Maybe someone here could help point me in the right direction of getting up to speed with some advanced JS stuff, including ajax and jquery? I don't understand ajax and jquery very well and I believe both are being used. I am especially confused by the dollar sign I see everywhere. ($) 

I wish I could just post some code but of course since this is a job and not a personal project I don't believe I can do this. Any help would be well...absolutely wonderful. 

I read stuff online about JS but it's pretty simple stuff. I don't know what makes looking at a lot of code and functions that go across several files and interact with CSharp elements and HTML elements so much more fucking difficult.

I'm currently thinking about paying NYU for their summer housing, which is about 380 a week and located at 1 East 2nd, 33 Third ave, 80 Lafayette St, or 129 Third Ave (this one is my preferred spot since it's closest to Grand Central).

One is getting married and moving to be near her fiance's children and my other friend got an incredible internship that is near her hometown. 

After my sister moved out in '96, my two brothers have both moved away, and then all of my best friends have moved away for educational or job opportunities and put down roots and haven't returned. I have friends in Alaska, Nashville, Eastern Washington, Chicago and two are in Europe. Now I can add Salt Lake City and Phoenix to that list. None of them are likely to come back, most have put down roots.  

The only support I have is my parents, but they are very negative and toxic people. My parents love my daughter a lot, but my mother is morbidly obese and a borderline hoarder. My dad is...unreliable. My husband and I have been separated since July, and while we are friendly we are not friends. 

Mostly I'm worried for my daughter. My parents moved up to the Seattle area when my siblings were little, and they never could quite break into any sort of social community/group. I was a very lonely child, my siblings were very dear to me. I followed their example and moved away to chicago for my freshman year of college but my experience was awful.  I would've moved home immediately but my parents refused to let me come home. When I did come home, I married pretty quickly to the first guy I met back home. I never made many new friends after moving home, and now the two girls who I've been abke to befriend are leaving. They are both people I wanted to be in my daughter's life as role models and women she could rely on. I have multiple sclerosis, so I want to have people who love my daughter and that she could turn to if I were ever to be incapacitated.  

I've toyed with the idea of finding co-housing or an eco-village to move into. It seems kinda risky, and most co-housing communities would be way too expensive for me to afford. 

I don't really have a question, or anything to say, I'm just tired of being left behind by everyone on their way to bigger and better things. I'm not the greatest at meeting people, and I'm naturally more introverted. Socially I am very normal, but I've always been better with fewer, more intimate friendships. I don't want my daughter to be lonely like I was growing up. I want her to feel secure and confident and to have some sort of community that is static and reliable. I am helpless to provide that for her, and it makes me so sad. "

I'm kind of at an interesting point in my life, and was hoping for some advice from someone with much more wisdom than myself.  It would be a shame if I didn't try to tap into the interesting minds of the reddit community :).  Hopefully this 4 minute read is worth your time, and is greatly appreciated…  

I'm in my young 20's, ""fresh"" out of college currently living in southern California.  I graduated with a 4.0 from two universities in two different countries with two separate degrees (consider it a super-study-abroad).  I've traveled all over the States due to internships and Europe due to schooling.  I have seen more sights than most people dream of.  I have no loans, financially very sound for my age, and jobs out to wazoo ranging in every industry from space, to biology, to even top secret jobs (I already have a clearance).  I've never had a problem finding a girl, although have yet to find one that I see spending the rest of my life with.  I have an absolutely amazing family, all of whom live in a nice retirement community and are begging me to come back home (rent free!).  I have four or so very close friends that are scattered across the states, and plenty of additional friends here and there.  From an third party standpoint, I'm beyond ""blessed"".  And yet, even with all of this, I still feel empty.

Moving to southern California was the first decision I made in my life so that I would be happy instead of an advancement in my career path.  However, things didn't turn out to well.  Being a workaholic from the east coast, I'm having a hard time adjusting to the California life style and all these party hard girls :).  After getting with a girl last night, her leaving because I wasn't interested in the whole shabang (I prefer wine and dine instead of get in get out), and not sleeping all night, I came to the realization that I'm not sure what I'm doing with my life or what I want.

On one hand, I've been debating joining the Red Cross and going to teach programming abroad, preferably in Africa or somewhere destitute.  I'm a little scared of making a career at a desk job at such an early age and have no interest in money.  I just want to do something for society and have a great time.  I enjoy research as well, and have considered doing an internship at the NIH to help advance modern medicine.  On the other hand, I want to find something meaningful.  A nice girl, steady job, home close to family, and friends that I know I will not lose in 6 months due to traveling so much.  For someone who always seemed to have an answer for his friends, I just don't understand why I'm not happy.  

Should I stay in California and give it a chance (been here 3 months), or go home (not sure I'll be happy either way)? Should I see a therapist?  Have you seen a therapist before?  What if it doesn't work?  I don't want depression meds or their 8281903 side effects…  What are some good books to read? Does this feeling of emptiness I've had since the beginning of college ""go away"" as I get older, or is it just one of those life situations you need to cope with?  Am I a spoiled punk who just needs to appreciate what he has (rules say ""No yes/no answer questions"", so ignore this one :))?

I know there are millions of others with the ""quarter life crisis"" as they call it that are way worse off than me.  I just wanted to here some anonymous thoughts from people who have maybe been through the same.

Thanks greatly for your time in advance."
qswwu,1,2012-03-12,How did you pick your major with so many opportunities available?,tswag,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qswwu/how_did_you_pick_your_major_with_so_many/,"Dear Reddit

I'm a nineteen year old sophomore at a university who is indecisive about his choice of major and almost clueless about his career path.  A year ago I started trading currencies, six months ago I started investing in the stock market.  Prior to trading currencies, my choice of major had been International Business and Finance; however, I changed my major to International Studies and Economics after I discovered this new found interest.  I figured these majors would complement the material I had been reading in order to establish a firm foundation for understanding markets in general.  Now, I have applied to study abroad at a university in Sweden and will be looking for internships there next year in the banking sector.  

However, I was playing Mass Effect 3 the other day (12 hours straight I might add) and went to sleep.  When I woke up I had a sense of peace, I did some self reflecting (no, not fapping) and really considered my motivations for banking, investing, etc.  I realized that all I was pursuing was cash.  I don't have a passion for managing money nor do I have a deep desire to make boatloads of money.  What I discovered was that I want to build things.  Things like robots, spaceships, airplanes, weapons, circuits, computer programs, or even solar panels. 

I'm getting advised at the end of the month so I plan to take one or two classes relating to the engineering field just to get my feet wet (I'd rather dive in but alas that's not encouraged at college, at least my college).  How did you choose what major you wanted?  I found that when I really thought about it I was regretting not taking science, math, and engineering classes.  Also, if you have any thoughts on what I'm doing I'd love to hear it, new perspectives and questions can never hurt."

This is too long to fit in one post, so I’m putting the TL;DR at the top.  The rest of the story is in comments:
**TL;DR** I went to undergrand and then grad school with a guy who I didn't know before college.  He was an opiate addict.  I went along with this friendship for years and years as he gradually, but then quickly, entered a downward spiral.  Shit hit the fan this year when he stole thousands of dollars from me.  I saw this coming for years and yet continued to trust him.  Finally, last week I contacted his sibling and his family intervened, yanked him out of grad school and sent him to rehab.  

Story (Part 1):
I met him the very first day I moved into my freshman dorm at our non-prestigious public university.  I was 18, had just moved over 1000 miles away from my small bedroom community hometown, and I was looking to make new friends.  About half of the residents on this floor had the same prestigious scholarship that I had, so I was sure I'd make some great new friends who were also really smart.  He was the first.  At that time, I was a closeted gay kid and he was an attractive, outgoing, and athletic guy who had also just moved in from across the country.  Of course I was naturally drawn to his looks and personality, although he has always been 100% straight and I knew I'd never get with him -- he would always just be a friend, and I was fine with this.  But throughout the eight years we were friends, I allowed my feelings for him to override every instinct I would otherwise have about a person, and allowed him to gradually become more and more of an abusive, troubled person, a person who has been nothing but a bad influence on my life.  

As undergrad progressed, he was one of my very tight, six-guy group of close friends, all of whom lived on this same dorm floor when we were freshmen.  Freshman year was a blast -- we had many nights of quiet drinking in dorm rooms to not draw RA attention, went to many house parties, smoked a few trees, and yet everyone still went to most of their classes and got good grades.  He found a local girlfriend (another freshman who got us access to many off-campus parties) during the first week of classes.  They dated for two years, and she bore the brunt of most of his rather erratic mood swings and semi-irresponsible behavior.  

At first, his irresponsibility was minor -- things like bad driving, never cleaning his room, and lots of underage drinking, but these habits were not unusual for a freshman guy and generally not a concern.  He also took a serving job at some chain restaurant in town, made good tips, and held that job down for the duration of freshman year.  From outward appearances, he was a successful person who was just enjoying college.  He even played some college sports, mostly as a walk-on player, or as a practice squad member or something like that.  

See, he had been a big athlete in high school and had got injured at one point and evidently once got prescribed vicodin or percocet.  By the day we first met, he was already a small-time opiate abuser.  He kept this a secret, but may have mentioned at a party or two that he had ""taken them before,"" but always in the past tense.

Freshman year was a blast, and he and I and two of our other very best friends moved in to a house together for sophomore year, and we lived there for three years until we all graduated on time.  The entire house was generally irresponsible, mostly by completely trashing the place through constant beer pong games, messes, and several house parties.  But everyone was still responsible with school and work, and things seemed fine.  He was still dating his girlfriend, and he adopted a puppy that he took very good care of.  Sophomore year was fine, although he and his girlfriend were constantly arguing.  Finally, at the beginning of junior year, they broke up.  This event led to his increased opiate use.  A year later, the dog escaped through a faulty fence and got hit by a car and died.  This further depressed him.  He spent most of his time in his room or working.  At this point, he was still good with money and was responsible at work, but he did this so he could use his tip money for pills.  None of us needed outside employment -- we had full scholarships that covered living expenses -- so extra income could be spent on anything, and he used it on pills.  None of us knew this was going on, but there were red flags.  He was spending less time with the rest of the roommates, and he'd have erratic mood swings and would constantly be scratching himself.  But he went to enough classes to still graduate with average grades, but he definitely had the lowest GPA of our group of friends.  When we moved out, we faced a steep repair bill.  He somehow didn't expect this or have any spare money.  That was the first time he borrowed money from me.  I lent him something like $1000.

When we graduated, we all went our separate ways.  None of us was from the city we went to school in and we were all from different cities.  I didn't hear from him for a few months.  He apparently spent the time waiting tables back home as we was taking a year off before grad school, which gave him plenty of tip money and access to opiates (which are big in the restaurant industry).  I worked in an office back home during this time.  Around Christmas, I finally got my money back from him, which I thought was gone forever, and he included a good amount of interest as well.  I also found out that we were both applying to grad school and were applying to some of the same schools.  Ultimately we both wound up enrolling at the same somewhat prestigious university.  I had gotten admitted a month or two before him and had already committed to living on-campus, and he wanted to live off-campus.

So, during our first year, we were not roommates but we hung out a lot at his off-campus house, which he shared with others who were in school with us.  He did not work outside of school until the middle of the spring semester, because his student budget ran out early.  (By the fall semester of our first year, he'd already developed a reputation of almost never attending classes, even though we're in a professional program.)  During the spring, I was irresponsible as well.  I didn't focus much on my classes because I'd drink with him.  Sometimes I'd take drugs with him, but never painkillers.  We did ecstasy a couple of times and took shrooms over spring break with one of his roommates.  During this year, he apparently borrowed rent money from multiple roommates of his because he was spending money on drugs.  I knew he borrowed money, but I didn't know how much, and it wasn't my business.  He didn't ask me for money that year.  I agreed to live with him the following school year, which is this year.

My grades sucked, but I got a good summer internship and everything was going great.  I didn't really keep in touch with him over the summer, but he was back at home so he didn't have to deal with rent problems that summer.

This school year, where we've been living in the same house (with some other students -- not the same ones as the ones he lived with last year), things have gone downhill quickly.  The pace accelerated in the fall semester, and then collapsed between December and now.  Right after we moved in, we were fighting frequently over frivolous things.  Knowing my reluctance to lend him money due to his delay in repaying me for his share of the housing damages after undergrad, he discovered a new way to get at my money -- by getting me on the habit with him.  The first time I took vicodin or percocet (I don't remember which; the drug of choice would change frequently depending on whichever was available) was probably in October.  He gave me some for free and explained what they did.  For some reason I decided to try them out (I was probably really hungover and wanted to kill the hangover).  I loved them.  I'm normally an introverted, socially awkward penguin.  When I took pills, I'd have a major personality improvement, I'd be smiling and engaging.  Soon, of course, he'd ask for me to pay for my share of the pills.  He'd buy about 120mg at a time ($1 per mg), and I'd get about 20 or 30 and he'd get the rest.  He'd get me to go to the ATM and give him $120 at a time and he'd promise to repay his share.  His failure to do so in short order didn't concern me because I was on these new awesome pills.  (He had worked at a restaurant for the first half of the semester, which is where he got referred to the local drug dealer, but he got fired halfway through the semester.  After this, he was constantly assuring me that he was looking for new jobs.)  I even secretly took some home for thanksgiving and had them in the bathroom at the beginning of a big family gathering, so that I could be more outgoing and have more fun chatting with lots of people.

qsl5b,15,2012-03-12,"Nepotism and Networking and the ""teacher's ghetto""",alookyaw,rwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/rwb/comments/qsl5b/nepotism_and_networking_and_the_teachers_ghetto/,"So I wanted to have a discussion about careers in NGOs, charities. I've been volunteering for a while in a developing country and have started my own mini projects doing things like teacher training. I've been looking for full time paid work with an ngo but have been frustrated and have made two observations.


1.Entry level jobs are generally not gained meritocratically. Think about it. Have you ever seen an entry level job for an ngo actually advertised for? most are given to friends or internships are suddenly created for friends of friends or someone part of a network. During my time spent in the developing world, I waited for entry level positions to show up on the mailing lists, etc, but they never did. While at the same time I saw people arriving with no experience of the country who were on entry level internships or jobs that were never advertised for. 

I think if we are honest about this, it is extremely corrupt. If the aims of NGOs are to provide the best possible service, then by not widening their net, they are limiting their potential for achieving those aims and more. By only hiring in secret (or worse holding fake job interviews to keep up appearances) they are discrediting everybody.

2.The teacher's Ghetto. I wonder how many people here are teachers and if they experienced this. Teacher's are often seen as the bottom rung in NGOS (and in most schools to be honest). They are viewed like cashiers in the supermarket, while the admin and HR are doing the brainwork/important stuff. Aside from this view being offensive (and wrong, given that teaching is one of the most creative jobs there is). it also lumps teachers into dead ends in their careers. 

From my experience, any NGO job that is hiring for admin/management will not take teachers into consideration. What is teaching if not managing? what I've found is that teaching is generally seen as a generic job and even if you spend years working as a teacher for ngos, it won't really help you if you wish to try other things.


Does anyone find their views to be similar? Have you faced your own struggles finding work? How did you get your first job?

I feel like I haven't learned that much from my education and internships. I am a nuclear engineer, yet I don't think I understand the concepts well enough to actually run a reactor. This is despite doing well at what I was taught and now I am not sure if I'll be an asset in the workforce. A professor has suggested that I enter the PhD program at my university but I am not sure I want to spend another four to five years in college. If I were to enter the workforce after college, would a Bachelor's be enough for me to succeed in the workforce, or should I take my professor's advice and enter the PhD program and is having a PhD actually worthwhile? Any advice from experienced engineers that have taken any path would be appreciated.

P.S. I'm currently in my sixth semester as a Junior."

I will be graduating next week with a bs in computer science and have decided to take some family up on a cheap offer to come and live with them in the beautiful Boise. My hometown is Aberdeen (pop: 16k) so it seemed like a fairly smart move to start my life post grad. However, not so smart, was my tardiness in doing any sort of job-hunting prior to my graduation. I am pretty much starting from square one here.

Are there any companies that you can recommend I look into for either an internship or entry-level position in software engineering or other computer science field? The family has friends who work at HP and said it might be worth a shot there, but I did not know if there were any other prime choices I should be aware of.

Many thanks!

qsezl,1,2012-03-11,"Two internship offers, not sure how to choose.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qsezl/two_internship_offers_not_sure_how_to_choose/,"I currently have two offers for an engineering internship this summer. Sort of. I guess I'm just looking for thoughts on how to choose, or what you folks might choose if you were in my position. I don't think either is necessarily a bad choice, but I still haven't been able to make up my mind.

Company A is a company I worked for as an intern a couple summers ago. I recently e-mailed my old boss saying that I was starting to look for internships for this summer, and might be interested in coming back to Company A. He asked me when I can start, and has CCed me on an e-mail to one of his managers to work on getting me back this summer. No formal offer has been made, but all implications point to it just being a matter of jumping through some hoops in HR. The problem is, I was just asking to see if they would be hiring, I didn't plan on them immediately jumping to the conclusion that I'd be working there. So, if I decline the impending offer, I would need to fairly political way of telling my old boss that I was just checking around, and won't be able to get there this summer, but I'd like to preserve the chance that I might be able to work there full time when I graduate.

I've never worked for Company B, but they've made me a formal offer and I have until tomorrow to decide whether or not I accept it.

**That's the short version, but if you want more, you can keep reading.**

The way I see it here are the pros/cons:

Company A is part of a large corporation that deals primarily in aerospace technology - an area I'm very interested in pursuing. However, the work done at the facility I'd be interning at isn't that exciting. But, they have a rotational leadership program that I could get into if I got a full-time job, and from there it would be fairly easy to transfer to somewhere more interesting. Also, Company A is in an area that is much more conducive to my hobbies/interests. There are mountains for hiking, trails for bike riding, and a decent downtown environment too. Although its worth pointing out, the cost of living is also very high. Another con is that I'd be the only intern. When I was there last, there were one, maybe two, people within 5 years of my age. I'd really rather not spend a summer in a town all the way across the country just being alone the whole time. And the last con is that, the last time I was there, they didn't have much work for me. It was somewhat understandable because I was only a sophomore in college, but I worry that I'll go back and just sit at a desk killing time the entire summer, not doing any work.

Company B works more in machinery and engines - still something interesting to me, but not quite what I've pictured myself doing as a career. My main reason for being interested is that I've never done any work outside of the aerospace field and I feel like it might be good to have at least some experience somewhere else in case aerospace doesn't pan out. I don't know much about the area. Its in a bigger city, but in the middle of Illinois. I grew up in the midwest and didn't really enjoy it that much, although I was always in the suburbs, not an actual city. From what I can tell, Company B has a well-established internship program - I wouldn't be the only intern and they even have some social events for the interns. The cost of living is lower, but the pay is fairly close to what Company A would provide, meaning I'd be able to save up a bit more money which might be nice, since I graduate in December."

all you see on screen is a couple of small kitchen mixers and a couple of ovens that can bake maybe 100 cupcakes at once.

I read r/relationships all the time and just want some advice on how to deal with being self conscious in a relationship. Obviously I know that he loves me, but I tend to get my feelings hurt very easily if he looks at other girls when I'm around (like when we're at the gym together or at the beach) and I just need someone to give me a smack in the face before I ruin our relationship because of my jealousy. He would NEVER disrespect me on purpose, but whenever I catch him being a normal guy and looking at a hot girl who walks past, I get irrationally mad.

To my knowledge, he has never been unfaithful or even wanted to be, but I can never help thinking of ""worst case scenario"" situations and I can tell he is getting annoyed. For example, he started a new job about 4 months ago and has a 22 year old intern working for him. He talks about her at home on a regular basis (not more than most people talk about colleagues) but I constantly convince myself he has a thing for her. 

Also, I know that I need to lose weight. I am not huge by any means, but I am working out a lot and trying to eat better so that I feel better about myself. Not sure whether or not this will solve the problem, but at least I am trying.

I go above and beyond to TEACH them new things, while at the same time achieving the perfection they weren't even sure they wanted until I showed them how to fully utilize their system and get the most out of it. I just really enjoy working with and on computers and helping people.

Reddit is a huge community and I have seen wonders come out of it. So I am posting my certificate here in hopes that I can get hired. I suck at writing resumes and cover letters, but I'm one heck of a test taker, a demonstrator, personable, committed, social, punctual, reliable, produce results, motivated, educated, willing to learn more, and am able to provide the best of customer service to any one requesting help from me.

Let me know if you need any other information. I am able to start ASAP. Finding jobs down here in Hayward is not cutting it. I'd rather shoot for a career. I've checked out all of those ""Online Courses"" and they are way to expensive and would take years to get what I just got in 3 months time.

Help me, help your company.

* Job: my SO is going with me (already graduate). He is a computer / software engineer. Where could he look for work?

* By the way, how is the labour market in Ireland / Dublin? Is it very difficult to find a job?

quu7x,0,2012-03-13,So I found out some things about this controversy about the Contraceptive Controversy. What does it look like to you?,rileymanrr,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/quu7x/so_i_found_out_some_things_about_this_controversy/,"I first heard that this was a possible set up from Rush Limbaugh and I thought it was just another conspiracy thought up by uber-conservatives, but upon research it may have some substance.

So here are a conglomeration of links that point to certain things about the Sandra Fluke controversy.

This is a link to the actual debate where the contraception issue is brought up. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxyzAjk72U

 Note how Romney reacts to the question and how Santorum reacts to being quoted saying ""I think states have the right under the tenth amendment and the rights of states to *act*."" 

Romney says ""George [Stephanopolos] this is an unusual topic that you are raising 'States have a right to ban contraception?' I can't imagine a state banning contraception. I can't imagine the circumstances that a state would *want* to ban contraception."" Later in the response ""The idea of you putting forward things that states might want to do, that no state wants to do, and asking me whether or not they could do them is kind of a silly thing.""


A few things are cleared up by this. Santorum does not want to ban contraception, contrary to popular belief. And he only thinks that under the tenth amendment, the states would have the power to rule on that topic. 

Secondly Romney is extremely credulous of the question itself, and (even though I am not much into conspiracies) he seems to think George Stephanopolis is up to something.


Now to Sandra Fluke: Fun fact. She is 30 years old. And if you check her Linkedin profile it will show her attendance to Georgetown University ( near Washington D.C.) was in her *Past*. Her current employment is stated as ""Legal intern at Coalition to Abolish Slavery and human Trafficking"" In Los Angeles.

She claims that birth control cost $3000 per year, when (for the same area) Planned Parenthood estimates the monthly cost of birth control to be between $15-50 per month. (a total of a maximum of $600 per year, one fifth of what she said) 

She was never going to be in the congressional hearing, and she was opposed by one of the people on the board because she had *no* expertise in the area (she wasn't experienced with the legal aspects of contraception and the constitutional impact it has on religious institutions) and so no reason to be in the hearing. 

So what do you think reddit? Is this a possible set up? The facts have some substance. The debate question in New Hampshire, the insertion of Sandra Fluke into the congressional hearing, the fact that she has been working in Los Angeles and that is stated as her current employer, and that the number for the cost of birth control is so ridiculous. 


TL:DR Could the Sandra Fluke controversy be a set up? By whom I do not know, but I do see a possibility in the facts.  

P.P: Sorry if this offends anyone (how I do not quite understand), but I found the facts surprisingly interesting. "

I hear a lot of talk about first names in the African-American community and where they come from (value placed on uniqueness, etc). I've also heard the currently accepted wisdom that slaves took their owners' last names when freed, as well as a competing/alternate theory that they simply took names of people they admired or names they perceived as typical or desirable. Is there any consensus on which of these origins is more common?

However, there are certain names I'm seeing in this data set which seem distinctly African-American. Not African, but also not names I have ever seen any caucasians with. There are also certain names that are definitely English in origin, but that strike me as ""black.""

I started as an intern/assistant in a very busy major north eastern city after applying for a saute position, the chef noticed i walked into something completely over my head but offered me a internship. 


I got my first real kitchen job shortly thereafter working as a garde manger(cold entrees,salads,desserts) the whole situation was very overwhelming. It was awful im naturally disorganized and not that fast, mostly very chilled out so it was a terrible match. I told my girlfriend of the time how miserable it made me, she threatened to kick me out if i quit. Having no where else to go at the time, i bit my tongue and complied until i got fired. Even thought I hated it, it broke my heart.
 My next gig was at a eastern European place in another north eastern destination but known for its agriculture. The place was new and it would just be me working with the owner, Everything was great for the few months. But then I started messing up much more than I did in the past. Breaking things on accident, messing up orders, getting frazzled and stressed until again I was ""let go"" via email.



 After a stint of unemployment I was back in the kitchen but this time at a ski resort out west. It was a glorified FRIDAYS type place, with burgers and some nice fish and steak entrees. I started out on the grill doing really well and then again slowly started to commit more erroneous acts, eventually being demoted to the cold station. I always tried and worked very very hard, but certain practices never really clicked. I lived alone in a one room apartment at the base of a mountain. I never really went out since the only things to do there were to ski or get hammered. I liked to stay home or go out alone to different towns, smoke pot and enjoy myself on down time, its how i relax. After a few months I left because the pay after rent was rather skimpy and again was just not feeling the whole situation. I still kept at it thinking that the whole ""Dont give up"" quotes were working hard at things that make you completely miserable. 

Shortly after I worked at a very small but very high class gastro pub, the kitchen was microscopic. 11 hours a day I prepped right in front of the hot flaming grill, dripping sweat nonstop until i left for the night. The days were filled with heavy lifting, mountains of prep work, insane service during the rushes. Again i was miserable, but I tried to have a better attitude about it and stuck with it. Unfortunately my means of transportation broke and could not still get there. When I called and told the chef about what happened he screamed at me and let me go right then.

 Next stop was the zionist summer camp, I did pretty well there as the chef preparing a nice meal for 250+ people daily for lunch and dinner all by myself. I got a raise in the first 2 weeks, it was great until they never put my raise into my pay checks. I left a week before it was over after not getting payed the amount I was owed and they started pushing work unfair work loads only onto me and not the other cooks.

 My mind would always break at a certain point craving to do other things with my life, but I always made myself keep with it. Further down the line I was the lead cook at a kosher catering place that had poor practices considering actual quality and that really hurt my soul, I stayed with them for half a year until i was fired for making the chef a bad sandwich. I had a few jobs after that in NYC which were great paying higher up chef positions but my spirit dwindles. I just didnt care, I cant make myself care about this profession but i keep with it because i dont know what else to do with myself. I want to start a farm and have been trying to get internships. i have two starting in a few months, one is just harvesting produce and the other I have yet to contact the people to set it up.

qukju,8,2012-03-13,5+ Year IT Professional facing crossroads,enetix,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qukju/5_year_it_professional_facing_crossroads/,"I think this is really more of a &lt;/rage&gt; or &lt;/gripe&gt; post more than anything but reddit always seems to be the best place for me to expunge some of my frustrations.

So here's the down low, the nitty gritty, the, well, you get the idea. I've been working in IT now for over five years. I started off at 18 years old as a Technical Intern, basically being an account administrator to my current company's EDMS system. The 6 month internship turned full time soon there after, which was great. I shown that I could do more than just add domain accounts to certain user groups on an application. My manager helped me transfer to the EDMS Application Development team, and I assumed the position of Junior Developer as one of my colleagues had left the company.

This position was great, and my manager was awesome. I had good amounts of direction on what I should be doing, and also got to work with a couple stellar Senior Developers and System Architects, where I tried to suck every bit of information from them as I could. I wrote and deployed several very successful applications for our EDMS system that our company considers cornerstone applications today!

That was short lived. I was a part of that department for about 2 years, then an IT reorganization happened. I was shifted out of Application Development into Application Administration (wtf?) and was told I was not a developer and had no idea what I was doing. Now, I am more unhappy than ever. My job consists of the same things I was doing as an intern, and keeping sharp in this interim has been hard. 

Now normally, any person within their right mind would say, ""Okay, time to go get a new job"". For me, this is a bit of a struggle. I've had *amazing* interviews where I knocked the socks off of IT Directors as well as technical leads to Application Developers. All of these interviews would end in heartbreak, because I only have my Associates Degree. Albeit, I am 8 classes away from my BS in CIS, and should be done by the end of this year, but being told that your experience is great but we're going to choose the joe right out of college with a BS instead of you with your 5 years of experience that matches up well with our position sucks. On top of that, I cannot particularly take a contract due to medical reasons (pre-existing conditions).

qujp7,10,2012-03-13,Am I being underpaid? Would anyone hire me in the USA?,hubcon,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qujp7/am_i_being_underpaid_would_anyone_hire_me_in_the/,"**TL;DR: Sick of current job, all alone in a foreign country (the USA), do I have what it takes to get a decent, but different job?**

Hey! I recently moved to the US from Denmark. I actually am in possession of both an American and Danish citizenship, although this is my first time living here (I already have been for a year by now though).

I'm a young man, 20 years old, and work as the ""junior"" sysadmin in a small business for the last 2 years. Well small in we are less than 25 employees in total, but from a technical perspective, we have plenty of IT related services including 6 branches in 2 countries with site-to-site VPN connecting everything together (what we do is provide virtual &amp; shared office space).

I have no certificates to show for, all I got is my 2½ year education as an ""[it-supporter](http://www.ug.dk/job/dataitogteleteknik/itadmsupport/it-supporter.aspx)"" where approximately half of that time is spent as an intern. I started that education when I was 15, learned the basics of electricity, but more relevant Cisco CCNA and basics of Microsoft domains. Although where I believe the education was most useful was the time spent as an intern, as I got my foot in the door &amp; learned how to act professionally as it was my first real job considering how young I was (or still am haha).

Anyway, my entire life is revolved around my current job, and I am starting to realize how unhappy I am since the job in itself is not what I want. Our CEO has major personal issues, has been going through a harsh divorce the last 3-4 years or so... and the only other IT person in our company is a sick person and an entire different story in itself. Let me just say that he is rarely at the office and can get away with this since our boss is across the Atlantic ocean, and has an extremely poisoned view of IT doing the bare-minimum required, even if it means going completely against best practices to get the job done. For example as we speak right now, our main and most important server, hosting 5 very crucial virtual servers, is and has been running off of a defective raid-5 array for the last half year.

I would be ""allright"" with this job, if it weren't for the fact that many of my ideas of improvements are often flat out denied, and when I do accomplish good things, there is no appreciation or feedback what so ever. Besides that there is barely any communication and/or teamwork between me and the ""other"" IT-guy and our boss is in Europe most of the time so I am alone pretty much EVERY single day. I just accomplished a major goal in my opinion last week, fully inspired by myself, a complete Nagios implementation monitoring ALL of our IT infrastructure, with alerts to everyone and an app for my iPhone which can wake me up in the middle of the night should something go wrong. Even utilized CloudKick for notification in the rare chance that the actual Nagios server loses connectivity. After documenting the entire setup and sending an e-mail regarding my work to boss and other it guy; I never even received a reply...

ANYWAY, on top of this my social life is non-existent and I'm living alone so I desperately need something to change as I feel like I'm breaking down. If I may summarize: 

I'm 20. Have been working as a junior sysadmin for 2 years at this company, before that was my education as an it-supporter, where 1 year of that education was spent as an intern working as a technician for personal and small-business.

I have no major specialties and no certificates besides my ""it-supporter"" education (in which I scored perfect 12 in all final-tests, although I could imagine that means nothing for an American job).

What I DO have is plenty of self-taught knowledge. To quickly go through skills and other various topics &amp; tools I know and have familiarized myself with: various raids, php, mysql, wordpress, deploying servers in ec2 and utilizing other various services from Amazon AWS such as S3 for backup, basic pentesting within BackTrack and assessing network security, the whole aircrack-ng shebang for pentesting wifi, utilization of encryption from tools such as truecrypt, google apps, microsoft ISA, ubuntu, xenserver &amp; vmware workstation, cisco from my CCNA practice from school, exchange, IIS, iphone app programming, rackspace cloud hosting, deployment of IT monitoring from nagios, google adwords and analytics for analyzing and improving marketing. Tools I know and use including malwarebytes, hijackthis, zenmap, windirstat, powershell, sysinternals suite, keepass, apache, iptables, photoshop, afteraffects, sony vegas.

I have no idea how relevant what I listed above is, and I don't want to come across as a typical ignorant and naive know-it-all, as I have great respect for everything I DON'T know. I obviously know far from everything about php, exchange and microsoft domains, but I know how to get them running, the basic troubleshooting and the basic programming in PHP. My point is that while I don't feel as if I have any unique specialty, I am good in the sense that I have a firm all-around skill base with the motivation and logically thinking brain required to easily go out and teach myself new things, in spare time or work time, if relevant. 

Now that you know a little bit about me, do you believe I have any shot of finding something else decent to do here in the United States despite my lack of a lengthy CV, certificates or local education? Any idea on where I'd stand and what I should aim for perhaps? Heck, I'd be willing to move anywhere practically. I'm just afraid that everything I can put on document will mean jack to an American company, but then again, I have no clue how it works.

Secondly, I'm being payed $2400 a month excluding healthcare, but actually including a company car... I'm being underpaid aren't I? Any speculations on what a fair salary would be?

Worst case I move back to Denmark. As good as my well-being could be over there, I feel like my life could turn out to be much more interesting if I give the United States a chance, hence my desire to stay here.

I apologize for the wall of text, but will very much appreciate any comments and/or advice. Do not be afraid to be blunt!"

I can't help but feel as though that's my mind lying to me.


Ever since about a year ago I've been starting to slip further and further away from the joy I once knew. Sure, I still have some times where I can actually say I enjoy life, but these times are growing fewer and father between. I'm currently living away from home, in Germany, until August. This year has been difficult, because my family, fiancée, friends from home; they aren't here. I have been losing interest in almost everything; sewing, drawing, video games. Sometimes I don't even turn on music while I mindlessly browse Reddit, just because I don't feel like it. I feel like I'm being crushed every time I get a rejection letter from an internship that I applied to as well. So far I've been working with the people in my program to land an internship that we all have to get in order to graduate in the program. 45 applications, a duration-of-stay question, and an interview later I still have absolutely nothing. My fiancée back in the US already has a summer position lined up, and I'm the last one in my program to get an internship.


I've never felt unhappier in my entire life. I went on MedMD quick to humor the notion that I might be depressed and took their survey. 29% into the survey, they stopped it and posted the phone number to the helpline (which I can't call internationally) and told me to call immediately. Clicking that little box that said ""Have you had increased thoughts of suicide?"" probably did that. Don't worry, I would never commit suicide; I won't ever let it come to that because of how anti-suicide I am, but the thoughts are still there almost like my mind is telling me *it's still a possibility...*


Now, I know a self-diagnosis isn't the greatest, but I think it might be right. Since I'm away from home I don't know how much reasonable access an American would have in Germany to anybody that could help. I'm even afraid to tell the people I know, though I have brought it up in the past that I might be getting depressed.


I don't know how to stop this."

I can't get my head around most of this, so it's easier to write it out in list form.

*My academic adviser fucked up and failed to tell me that I need six more credits to graduate. I am in my final semester, supposed to be graduating in May.

*My parents have told me they are not willing to pay for the extra classes I now need to graduate. They suggested I take out a loan to pay for the classes, but I have no job, no credit history, and no way to assure any loan service I'm going to pay them back. (And ha ha, student loan bills will start coming in right after I graduate. Those I can defer, but still.)

*I can't. Get. Any. Fucking. Job. I'm not kidding when I say I've sent out close to a hundred applications in the last two years--for paid positions, internships, anything. My resume isn't shit, either--I've been working at least part time since I was fourteen, and have been doing work study the whole time I've been in college. Granted, I don't have many extracurriculars to my name (in part because I spent most of my youth terrified of other people), but it's not as though I'm totally inexperienced. In two years I got one response from an employer. One. I couldn't handle that internship because of my course load.

*The next thing my parents suggest is the whole ""move back home, get a job, figure it out from there"" thing. I'm familiar with that situation millions if not billions of college grads have found themselves in--get a diploma, nowhere to work and nothing to do, go back home. If I didn't loathe my hometown so much, I could accept that. But elementary/middle/high school was hell for me. I was an outsider then and am still treated as such. I have made almost no friends there, and what friends I made have moved away. I have nothing and no one there.

*Worst of all--and this might ring hollow, but it's what has been making me cry the most throughout all of this--I might lose all ties to my best friend. I honestly can't imagine my life without him. I don't know what would happen to our relationship once I leave.

So after all that, I've given up. I cry uncontrollably at least three times a day. When I'm not crying, I feel utterly blank--not happy, not sad, nothing. I can't get myself to do anything. The inevitability of it all--losing my chance at a diploma, my only friends, everything I've known for the last four years--has me feeling utterly helpless. Why keep trying to get a job/internship if I'm just going to get rejected again? Why keep up with schoolwork if I'm not even going to be able to afford a diploma? Why keep up with any friends if I'm just going to have to leave them in two months?

I don't know what I'm looking for here. Just some support I guess. Please don't tell me that this is the time for me to completely reinvent myself and start all over or whatever, I respect that you're trying to help but I'm not feeling particularly optimistic and every time I try to be I just start crying. All I want to know is how to make this current situation suck less."

I just took my Numerical Methods and Analysis final, and from my (usually fairly accurate) guess, I probably got a 60%... I got a 60% on the first midterm and a 100% on the second.  The first 60% was because I fucked up big time on LU decomposition (seriously, why do I need to do that when I can have MATLAB solve the matrix?  I can check its answers by hand) and then this time I'm pretty sure I fucked up on modeling both of the diff eq problems (which he did a shitty job teaching anyways).  All tests were open book, so had I bought a book I probably could have gotten an 80% on those two tests I'd think.  Oh well, lesson learned on that one...

Anyways, this puts me at about a 78% or so for the class.  C+.  Probably gonna drop my GPA, should be TOO bad since I've currently got a 3.638 and have an internship set up which will put work experience on my resume.

What I wanna know is, how bad is a C or two on your transcript, and am I really going to need to have a working knowledge of the 20 different ways to model an ODE to get through later classes?"

Did two internships/jobs simultaneously over the past three summers, almost all with nonprofits. [Last summer I interned with an ad agency and worked in retail part-time.] None of the internships were paid, and accordingly, I was more responsible for administrative stuff/""do what we ask you to"" than anything else. In the summer of 2010, though, I did go to Madrid and intern with two nonprofits there via an intern-abroad program. I mostly translated stuff from Spanish to English, but I was in an office environment five days a week using Spanish (most of the time).

I moved back to my home state right before Christmas and got a job in January with a professional organization for Spanish/Portuguese teachers. The position was administrative/customer service-related, so I was mainly processing membership dues and handling teachers' questions over the phone and via email. However, everything turned into a clusterfuck once my bosses decided that they had to treat me like a child and dictate my assignments to me every day. Three weeks ago, I got my hours cut to part-time at $10/hour; last Monday, I literally walked in the door and got fired---because I always showed up to work early, I left the building just as the other two women were getting out of their cars.

Now I'm trying to apply for jobs in marketing and advertising, but every time I start to look at LinkedIn, different sites, etc., I just get overwhelmed. 

A) **I don't feel like I have anything to offer anyone. No digital or graphic design experience, and for all the lip service paid to knowing another lanaguage, no one cares that I know Spanish.** [My bosses at the teachers' org were not impressed by my internships in Spain, or that I'd had any previous office experience at all, since it wasn't paid.] Even if I were to move to a city like Miami, I don't know who'd want to hire a white girl who isn't completely fluent.

B) I know I'm never going to get a job if I don't step away from the computer, but I really don't know anyone that well. There are a couple of leads in the area (and by leads I mean people who might pass my resume along), but I met them right before I got my job in January and haven't spoken to since. **If I can't even keep a simple administrative job for more than 6 weeks, then how can I even promote myself to a potential employer?** Also, I'm not even sure what I want to do in the first place, and it's killing me to be unable to hone in on something specific.

Oh, and did I mention that my one boss at the 6-week job is a close friend of my extended family (as in BFF with my aunt and uncle since kindergarten-close)? My aunts, uncles, and grandparents were all excited that I finally found a full-time job, and now of all my relatives, my dad's the only one who knows that I'm unemployed now, because I live at home.

**tl;dr Lots of little jobs and nothing to show for them, so how do I motivate myself--how do I demonstrate to myself and others that I'm actually a competent, employable person?**"

After I left her house last week after arguing with her, I decided to let her call me since she had said that she needed space. I heard nothing from her all weekend. I texted her on Monday to see if she wanted to hang out, but she said that she was feeling sick.

She sent me a message on Facebook today and asked if we could talk tonight. In the end, she said that she was ridiculously busy and needed for us to take a break. She said that she isn't interested in seeing anyone else in the least, but she's been working 50+ hours a week at work and has had a lot of homework. I know that to be true.

I guess I'm just concerned because I see her rarely as it is. I willingly make time out of my schedule to hang out with her, as she lives 45 minutes away from me and I am the one that most often drives to her. We left the whole ""break"" thing relatively undefined, even though I asked her two or three times about it point blank.

I am aggravated because she spent a decent amount of the conversation talking about how busy she has been. I know she has a lot on her plate at work, but she's taking one class this semester. I'm taking four classes, along with working a part-time internship and a paying job. I practically had a nervous breakdown last week because I had a presentation and two 30+ page papers due in two days, and here she is talking about how much work she has to do for a single class. I'm being petty, I realize, but it struck me as so self-centered.

If I'm being truly honest, I'm more sad and tired than anything else. I've fought for this girl for four years, and it's been worth every moment of it. I love her. But now I'm tired and I don't know if I have that much left in me to fight for our relationship anymore. She says that the break will last until the semester ends in late April, but for all intents and purposes I'll be treating this like a break up. Hit the gym, delete Facebook, and all that shit.

I feel like I've been left holding the bag. Should I continue to try to hang out with her, or should I end contact? What's the healthiest way to deal with this? She says that she doesn't want to see anyone else and doesn't want this to mean that we break up, but I'm skeptical.

**TL;DR-** Girlfriend called me tonight after not talking to me for a couple of days and said that she wanted to take a break. She said that she isn't interested in anyone else, but she's busy at work and school. I'm afraid that that means that I won't be able to see her at all."

qvenm,1,2012-03-13,Internship Question,pewpewx1456,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qvenm/internship_question/,"Ok so my internship is 3 months long which means 4 days a week, 7 hours a day counting lunch which I think is a lot for an internship.

However, I see other people in the company have internships but only come in 2/3 days a week but not even for 7 hours, sometimes its less because they have school and they claim their internships are 3 months as well. I think i'm getting the short end of the stick here, should I call out my boss on it? FYI, it is an unpaid internship for all as well. She stated that their internships are 3 month duration at 25 hours a week.

If so, How should I approach this?"
qveit,2,2012-03-13,Realistic budget for trip to Australia/NZ &amp; SE Asia,umlong23,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/qveit/realistic_budget_for_trip_to_australianz_se_asia/,"So, I just signed on for my first engineering internship. Instead of going the traditional route of a 4 month summer internship, I've signed on for the next 12 months, and the pay is pretty good. That means I have 4 months off for the summer of 2013 before I go back to school.

I've always wanted to travel, so this is a great opportunity. Realistically once I graduate I will have either time, or money. Not both at the same time. Furthermore I've always had an interest in Australia and New Zealand, so that's the logical destination for me.

What kind of budget am I looking at? Round trip airfare from my homebase is ~$1800-$2000, starting my journey in either Auckland, Syndey, or Bangkok. Probably want to spend 7-8 weeks total, with 3-4 weeks in SE Asia. Hostels, cheap transportation and budget everything is what I'm expecting. I want the experience, not a luxurious holiday. 

I'm also using this job to pay for at least my next year of school, so I am budget conscious, so just from my brief reading in the last week, I'm thinking somewhere between $4-5000 on top of my return airfare should be adequate. I have an acquaintance who's in Australia right now, so I'll have to talk to her about what she spent when she gets back in a month or so.

Any other tips you have for these regions? Any personal experiences you've had that I won't read in the guidebooks? I only want to peg down my start and end date, everything in between will be last minute plans, but with a few goals of what I'd like to see.

Thanks in advance!"

What can I tell husband is a good alternative?,dogfur,Paleo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/qve8v/dr_told_husband_hes_drinking_too_much_water_and/,"We have been 'eating healthier' since Jan 1, 2012 and converted to Paleo (Primal, actually) Feb 1 and have been doing it since.  Husband follows it with us and is probably eating Primal (Paleo but with hard cheeses and plain greek yogurt) about 80-90% of the time.  He's doing great.  He feels great.  He lost 15 pounds in this timeframe.  He is 5' 8"" and now weighs 176 -- down from 192.  He's always had an athletic build.  He doesn't exercise but we chase around twin toddlers.



He went to the doctor today for a routine checkup and his blood pressure/other vitals were terrific.  (No bloodwork.)  But, husband drinks a lot so is peeing (clear) frequently throughout the day.  I think husband told me that the doctor checked his urine because the doctor advised him that he's ""drinking too much water and flushing too much out.  Consume Gatorade/Powerade to replace your electrolytes.""



I am pissed because I don't want those sugary drinks in our house!!  So, what can I offer my husband as an alternative to that which is still true/close to Paleo/Primal?  (DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO WEAN HIM FROM MTN. DEW?!?  THE DR. IS UNDOING THAT PROGRESS!!)



PS: Sometimes husband gets too busy and skips lunch.  He has a good breakfast and great dinner.  Don't know if this is exacerbating the problem.  Rant over.  Advice sought.


EDIT:
So my idiot husband...when he got home, I asked him, ""So, did the doctor actually TEST your pee to ""prescribe"" you that [to drink those shit drinks]?""  He says, ""No.  I just told him that I drink a lot of water but it makes me pee constantly and that's what he told me.""  WTF?!  My husband does NOT pee a lot...he pees about 1x/hour...which is ideal, if you can DRINK that much to make yourself pee that much!  I am so annoyed that husband told this to doctor -- not REALLY representing a true concern [because there is none!] and even MORE annoyed that the Dr. would ""prescribe"" something like that without even testing! 

My husband goes, ""Well, that's what the doctor said and I am not going to go against a doctor's advice.""  [PALM SLAP TO THE FOREHEAD!]  I am honestly so mad I either want to switch doctors or call them up and let them know their unhelpful and unhealthy advice has now upset the home balance.


FINAL EDIT:
So, husband revealed that he didn't actually see the doctor.  He was at the doctor's office but a medical intern (doctor in training? kid on his residency?) was the one who saw him during his visit.  So it was this INTERN that told him to drink Gatorade.  :-/"

qyhjq,3,2012-03-15,The worst migraine nap-dream. ,lemon_SQUISH,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/qyhjq/the_worst_migraine_napdream/,"Some background: I had just done yoga and cleaned my bathroom, and I'm dating a guy who does not have a brother in real life. I'm in Arts in school, and have never wanted to be a doctor.

Just had a nap to relieve a migraine, had a dream that spanned a total of about 5 years. I just kept flashing forward to different times in my life, and it just kept getting worse and worse. 

So in the beginning of this dream, I was studying to become a yoga master. My mentor was this mean young man, and his yoga studio was a small shack in the middle of an industrial part of town. Basically, I spent my time in this tiny little shack cleaning the bathroom. Nothing yoga related, just cleaning this decrepit little bathroom, everything was broken, and only some of the toilets flushed, and no matter how much I cleaned it, it was dirty. Then, one day, I met an old woman who was also cleaning the bathroom. She was also ""studying to become a yoga master"" in this yoga studio, but she had been cleaning the bathroom since she was my age. I realized that bathroom would never get clean, and decided to cut my losses, and become a doctor!

Fast forward, and I'm doing an internship (in a hospital in the biggest mall in NA, West Edmonton Mall), getting mentored by this awesome woman, being really successful at doctor stuff, etc. Then I look down at my abdomen, and it's huge. I realize I'm very pregnant, but my boyfriend and I have broken up a few weeks ago. 

Fast forward again, and I'm living with my ex boyfriend, his mom &amp; her boyfriend, his grandma, his sister, and his brother (who doesn't actually exist). I decided to live with them because my ex's mom and grandma wanted to help raise our baby, which meant I could continue with my internship. BUT their place is also in West Ed. Mall, you go down a hallway, and it's just this room, with a bunch of mattresses on the floor. There is no furniture or anything, just mattresses to sleep on, and I have this baby, who I HATED.

Then, back at my internship, my mentor had quit for some reason, and was replaced by an eccentric Swedish man, who claimed Swedish was the only good language in the world, and all of my reports and presentations had to be in Swedish. I live in Canada, and only know the Swedish word for ""Thanks"" so that was rough. I knew I had no chance of completing my internship, but I just kept trying and trying, translating everything I wrote to Swedish.

Fast forward again, baby is now a toddler, and she cries non stop. We are still living in our West Ed. Mall room, and I'm sitting on the floor with my crying baby. My ex comes into the room, he looks upset. ""My grandma just had a stroke"" he said, and we are all sitting on our cots. All of a sudden, his grandma looks at her left arm, and says ""fuck,"" and we all know she's having another stroke. So my ex starts freaking out, and vomiting EVERYWHERE. All over the ground, yelling the whole time. Most of the them go off to the hospital again, and I'm left with my child, my ex's brother, and vomit everywhere. My kid is playing with this glass bulb thing she found, and then she sat on my lap, and looked me, and for a split second, I loved her.

We didn't have any cleaning supplies for the vomit, so we have to bus to a different mall to get them (ex's brother didn't care that there was puke everywhere, but he had nothing better to do). The store is closing in 2 minutes, and we finally have all our supplies ready to be purchased. Ex's brother (who by the way has been a total dick this whole dream) is messing around and embarrassing me, so I playfully punch his arm. He is FURIOUS, slowly turns to me, and says quietly ""I would love nothing more than to punch you right now. Actually punch you, and cause a lot of damage. But I can't, because you're a woman. So I'm going to do something better."" And then he took all the groceries I was holding, and threw them ALL over the store. He threw them like 30 yards. Since the store was closing, I didn't have time to go around finding them, and we had to go home empty handed. He was very aware that the mess bothered me a lot, it was a dick move.

So we get home, and I just start crying. I'm basically sitting in a puddle of vomit, with a crying toddler, crying my eyes out. Ex boyfriend comes home, his grandma died at the hospital. He ask why I'm crying, and I sob out ""My life. It wasn't supposed to be like this. I was supposed to be a yoga master, but now I can't even be a doctor because I don't know Swedish!"" He comforts me, and tells me to get some sleep, and it will be better tomorrow morning. Then his fucking brother starts riding around our little room on a quad. He runs over my ex's phone, and I pick the phone up, to make sure it isn't broken. I see he has a new girlfriend, and they've been sending each other lovey dovey texts and shit. He has this new awesome life with a childless girlfriend, and I'm living in a room with no furniture, sobbing in a pool of his vomit. Then I woke up."

I am a 3rd year student (maybe 2nd year... not sure how much my first year 7 years ago counts) and have a good GPA (3.7 last semester, and over 3.5 every semester since I've returned to school). I am excellent in math and graph theory, and theoretical computer science. My applied skills are good, but I'd doubt they are outstanding (I know what I need to do... I just have to Google to find ways to do it).


I am active at my university and I have begun the school's first open source program and have done work for various people including business owners and professors.


I have friends that have told me ""If we have an internship position available, I'm sure I can get you in."" These are friends I have made over the years playing various games. Other than that, I am from a smaller town which has few opportunities working with 1 or 2 people for the summer (and I'd much rather do Google Summer of Code).


I've had projects, which I do for fun, noticed by university staff, newspapers, and even Microsoft's Channel 9.


For the life of me, I haven't been able to get an interview with a larger company. I'm not terribly interested in game design... ideally, I'd like to get an internship with a company like IBM, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, NVidia, etc.


I don't think my resume is outstanding, but it conveys what I've written here. Clearly I must do something more to get noticed. I've tried to do networking with people from my ""target"" companies, but I've not done well (though having a few conversations). 


So... any tips for getting an internship or at the very least, how to get to an interview? (Note, I am Canadian, and I am from the West Coast)"

After almost 12 months at r/business — first as a summer intern while on Digg, then as a subscriber for 10 months, and now in London — I believe I have been here long enough to understand the trajectory of its culture, its people and its identity. And I can honestly say that the environment now is as toxic and destructive as I have ever seen it.

To put the problem in the simplest terms, the interests of the redditor continue to be sidelined in the way r/business operates and thinks about stories. r/business is one of Reddits largest and most important subreddits and it is too integral to global finance to continue to act this way. r/business has veered so far from the place I joined right out of Digg that I can no longer in good conscience say that I identify with what it stands for.

It might sound surprising to a skeptical public, but culture was always a vital part of r/business success. It revolved around teamwork, integrity, a spirit of humility, and always doing right by our redditors. The culture was the secret sauce that made this place great and allowed us to earn our redditors’ trust for 4 years. It wasn’t just about links; this alone will not sustain a subreddit for so long. It had something to do with pride and belief in the subreddit. I am sad to say that I look around today and see virtually no trace of the culture that made me love readding this subreddit for many years. I no longer have the pride, or the belief.

...

Today, many of the mods display an r/business karma quotient of exactly zero percent. I attend discussions where not one single minute is spent asking questions about how we can help redditors. It’s purely about how we can make the most possible karma off of them. If you were an alien from Mars and sat in on one of these discussions, you would believe that a redditors success or progress was not part of the thought process at all.

It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping their redditors off. Over the last 12 months I have seen five different mods refer to their own redditors as “sock puppets,” sometimes over PM. Even after the memes and rage comics? No humility? I mean, come on.\* Integrity? It is eroding. I don’t know of any illegal behavior, but will people push the envelope and pitch karma-lucrative and complicated comments to redditors even if they are not the simplest comments or the ones most directly aligned with the redditors understanding? Absolutely. Every day, in fact.

It astounds me how little senior mods get a basic truth: If redditors don’t trust you they will eventually stop talking with you. It doesn’t matter how smart you are.

qy62z,8,2012-03-15,On Day 2,dissucks,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qy62z/on_day_2/,"So... I've been smoking for the past 6 six years, I'm 22 now and just about to graduate university. The past two years I've been smoking pretty much every day (usually multiple times a day, bong rips are my main method). Before that it was 4-5 times a week. I'm feeling restless, agitated, and find myself getting angry at nothing. I've taken tolerance breaks before and while they can be a bit of a nuisance, knowing that I'm not going back to my daily habit seems to make it much worse, like I'm letting these feelings get the better of me. It sucks. My mind is racing and everything I do makes me want to smoke. I just feel like this is so stupid because it's just weed. To be honest, while I'm on day two, yesterday I took an amphetamine derivate to get some work done (I like to dabble with a variety of stuff, but none of these I use regularly), so I'm not sure if it counts. I also just smoked a cigarette (I'm not a smoker, I don't really enjoy it that much), and it calmed me down a bit. Even as I write this my sentences just seem to jump from one random thought to the next.

I've always justified my heavy usage through a variety of ways. All my friends do it (this is just because I regularly hang out with potheads, my friends who aren't smokers I just see infrequently), so it never really felt like a big deal. I do well in school, but haven't really had to work that hard. My major is largely test based and mathematical, and it's always come relatively. I've been accepted at a decent grad school for good money, so it's not like weed has ruined that aspect of my life. BUT, I know I could have done so much better, done more research, gotten all A+'s, internships, etc. I operate at the minimum level to convince people that my habit (really an addiction) is not a problem. I quit my job in november because I was sick of it, and haven't really been doing much since then except finishing up 2 classes and getting high. I wanted to go travelling this summer, but I've burned through what I had saved up so I could sit at home and get high. 

Reasons I'm quitting: I feel numb, I'm not even sure if I've felt real emotions in a long time. My Grandmother died in January (I think, my memory's shit), and I didn't feel anywhere near the same as when my Grandfather died. I enjoyed smoking initially because it calmed my sixteen year-old self down and really helped with anger issues. Now want to have real, deep relationships with people. I don't want the basis of my friendships to be our co-dependent use. Honestly even my friends who aren't regular users smoke when they hang out with me, mainly because I have some and want to get high. Money, I have no idea the amount of money I've spent on pot in the past six years. If I had to guess I would say it's around 5k (maybe more), including a beautiful $250 dollar bong and my $300 vape. I don't necessarily regret the money spent, but it just seems excessive for what pot's given me. I want to get my attention span back, I used to be an avid reader, going through 2 books a week during adolescence. Now I don't read at all (I just get distracted and do something else). 

Now, I don't think cannabis is bad, or anything of that sort. I just can't have a healthy relationship with it at the moment. At some point in the future I may want to indulge occasionally (never purchase for myself), but I'm not sure if that will ever be possible. I have such fond memories of the first times I got high, and they ridiculous things we would do sneaking around to take a toke. I don't regret my decisions, but enough is enough, it's time to not be dependent on a mind-altering substance. 

As I type this there's a part of my brain telling me all of this is silly and that weed isn't the cause of how I feel. It may be right, but weed let's me avoid dealing with a lot of things I need to deal with to be a happy person. My parents always said in order to be happy with other people, you need to be able to be happy by yourself, and I've never been without Mary Jane. I could honestly type endless paragraphs about my use right now, as it's pretty much the only thing on my mind, so I'll just leave it at this.

Thanks, and reading this sub-reddit has been a huge help."

Apart from the extremely comprehensive efc forums, there are very few places where we can go to do this. This reddit has been an excellent resource for new users seeking impartial information on vaping. If you ask a question, you will get information from another user, not a marketing attempt from a vendor.

Has this changed? Seeing a half dozen coupon deals at the top of the reddit gives me pause. Every vendor posting now may be on the up-and-up, but who's to say a scumbag won't come along and rip people off? We have no mechanism to prevent that. A top link from this reddit is close to a endorsement to a newbie. I've also suspected that companies have created sockpuppets to post here, which makes me wonder how newbies will know if the person answering them is  someone who vapes and is expressing an honest opinion, or a marketing intern selling newbies crap. Can the usual upvote/downvote mechanism address this? Maybe not. This is a relatively small reddit - it does not take much to game us. 

My solution, move all vendor posts to a separate subreddit, linked from our sidebar. Keep [/r/electronic_cigarette](/r/electronic_cigarette)  for users.

Edit: In addition to ranting about the issue I've created [/r/ecig_vendors/](/r/ecig_vendors/) for this purpose. I have no desire to moderate it, so if someone wants to run it, I'll hand it over. If someone want to create a different reddit for this purpose, I'll delete mine. "

I am a 20 year old, female BA (Hons) Media student from Scotland who is currently in the deadline depths of third year (RANK, btw). 
I just wanted to ask, how do I go about getting an internship in a radio station? 


I love music and talking :P. So I figured this would be the ideal career for me when I leave University. 

I am also contemplating not coming back for my Honours next year, since I am just really not enjoying being here anymore and want to get out into the world of work as soon as possible!

If I can't get into radio I'd love to try and get into the festival/record label industry.

And in the traditional sense of drunken Wednesday stupidity (well, it's tradition to *me*), YOU should come out to a fine, classy establishment with us and get shit-faced! And also because there's no better social lubricant between a bunch of strangers that point guns at each others' faces over the internet, than grub and alcohol.

Down for it? Leave it in the comments. Add me as a friend on Steam [asdf | DRUNK]. RSVP with a wax-sealed letter. I don't care, just make it known.

**Who exactly is ""Us""?**  
If Jereair and 1nked remember, they AGREED to make this meetup happen, so this is some real-deal shit. They can't even back out now without looking like total jerks who don't want the rest of you to have a good time.

**Where are we going?**
Somewhere local that has pretty good beers and pretty good food. I'm nominating either Stone Brewery or Churchill's Pub in San Marcos. If you think you know better than me, leave it in the comments.

**When are we going?**  
Unless anyone convinces me otherwise, we should make this magic happen on the last weekend of March. Coincidentally, this is also the first weekend of April. Maybe we party so hard past midnight and this turns out to be the best weekend you've ever had in both months, simultaneously. That's a two-fer, and you'd be kicking yourself in the pants if you were to miss out on such a steal. So if you didn't buy a new calendar for 2012 yet, that's 3/31, Saturday. Let's do 7pm, because that damn daylight savings messed everything up and I like to drink as it gets dark.

**How do I get there?**  
You're a big girl, you can use the Google Maps

**What do I wear?**  
A FUCKING HAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? PROBABLY OTHER CLOTHES, TOO.

**TL;DR;IMSTUPID:**  
You're going to be at Stone Brewery on Saturday 3/31 at 7pm. asdf | DRUNK told you to.

**So whaddya say, tf2west? See you there?**    
Even if it's just 5 of us, it's better than hanging out on the TF2 home screen waiting for that 24/24 to say 23/24!

-----

**EDIT 3/16:**    
CRY SOME MORE. Some of you propose next weekend, **Saturday, April 7**. I don't care the date, as long as the majority is happy and can make it. I think a Facebook event is in order? I'm not friends with any of you internet strangers so not sure of how to proceed. Should one of you be promoted to Head Event Coordinator and do all of the work at intern salary? Apply within.

Anyways, more details to those who wanted it:  
Stone Brewery for beer action at 7p, and wandering in the gardens with beers until we get over it and want to go to a place with a full bar. Stone has appetizers and stuff you can get at the bar, so if you come hungry, bank on eating this sort of stuff. If you're trying to get dinner, good luck. The kitchen is remodeling so they are PACKED. Then off to Churchill's, not too far away. There's food here too and it's pretty good. If you've never been to either, you're in for a treat, I promise. All you have to do is either like beer or not be afraid to order something new to drink. If you ask for a Budweiser, you will be escorted out of both of these establishments. Also, don't forget that we're probably going to be outside all night, so wear warm things. If you show up in full TF2 cosplay, I will pretend that I do not know you.  

Yep, those are the rules when drinking with asdf | DRUNK. But, I'm telling you all these things so you don't embarrass yourself (or me), guys. Remember last time we were all gung-ho about an idea and acted without proper planning and preparation? Yep, that's how koth_halffort got installed on this server. I'm just looking out for my peeps, ya dig?

qxkhu,3,2012-03-15,I just need to vent. This feels like a good place to do it.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/qxkhu/i_just_need_to_vent_this_feels_like_a_good_place/,"I guess I'll start off with this. Hi. I think I have some issues that can pretty much be summed up with the term anxiety. I feel like I'm always having to prove myself to people and I get really worked up over it. School, work, relationships, driving, fitness, everything. 

This first part is mostly about troubles with my weight anxiety, understandable if you'd like to skip over it. I know I'm not fat. Im not skinny enough to be considered anarexic. Ive never really tried bulimia, but I scare myself when I start thinking about how I could make myself puke. I'm about 5'4/5"" ish. My lowest weight was 108 five years ago. I was at an equilibrium basically between 110 and 115 and cried whenever I gained an ounce. I felt my biggest when I was at 108 and my boyfriend at the time told me I had fat thighs. This was about 4 years ago, shortly after my month long experience with what I guess could be called ""exercise bulimia"", which basically meant that I would vigorously work out on the eliptical for hours a day and burn way more in that workout alone than the strict 1000 cal diet I kept myself to. I know that behavior is destructive to not only my physical health but also my mental health. I'm in a great relationship right now, my boyfriend actually says I'm too skinny and shouldn't worry. I'm obsessed with the numbers though. I decided to stop worrying about it and get it out of my head by not weighing myself every day like I used to. Until a few weeks ago, I hadn't weighed myself in a year. I don't feel like it helped however. I was absolutely terrified to go to the doctors office because I didn't want them to tell me I gained weight, which I know I had. I passed out recently from little sleep, little food, lots of caffeine and added pressures from upcoming finals. Ended up going to the emergency room and I HAD to get a checkup done at that point. I am now 119 now. That's the most ive weighed since elementary and middle school, where my highest was 124. To keep things in perspective, ive been this tall since I was about 12 or 13. I'm 20 now. I didn't tell my doctor or anyone about how upset I was and how that was probably the main cause of the episode until I got home. I guess I tried to pretend I was okay and my boyfriend could tell because as soon as he saw me he asked what was wrong. That was the first time I told him any of these problems. He was there to support me and I'm very thankful for that. I still find myself relapsing though and feeling guilty whenever I eat something that isn't a low calorie fruit or vegetable. I've been looking at thinspo a lot recently and it doesn't help. I want toget back down to 108 so bad it hurts. I want to be really fucking tiny. My logic tells me I'm being absolutely ridiculous and to stop it, but I find myself wandering I thought about it and seeing girls at my uni and thinking DAMN. I wish I were as small as you. This mindset is really destructive and I know it. I just can't help it no matter how hard I try. It usual wins over my logical side and I end up just feeling really negative. I think I may have BDD. Girls I think are my size are actually way bigger than I perceive them to be. I wear a size 3 pants. I have a friend who I thought was my same size. Turns out she's a size 9. How do I get out of this?



School stress. I'm in my second year for a Chem degree. I was always told I was smart. I know I can be pretty lazy, but I get my shit done to my best ability. I want to pursue a masters degree but I'm afraid I'm not good enough to get an internship. C+ in the first semester of ochem. Im taking the second one right now and my grade isn't that pretty so far. I want to do better, but I just feel like I can't possibly absorb any more information when I try to study. And fuck. It's a chemistry class. That's my major. Why am I struggling? There's no excuse. Especially when I don't have a job. I'm starting to think about changing my major but I don't know anything else. It would also be a huge waste of time and money spent at this point. I'm not even sure if this is what I want to do anymore, but I'm stuck. Sometimes I freak myself out and think about how easy it would be to just drop out, run away. Sometimes even driving into a wall. That really scares me. It's only for a second. I'm not suicidal. I'm just scared of the future and want an easier way to pursue it. That train of thought has only entered my mind a couple times. Mostly I'm just thinking, fuck it. Im going to beauty school and doing hair. 


I've been thinking a lot lately about my future too. I think in scared because mostly I have no idea where I'm headed. No one else thinks about it like I do, so far in advance. At least anyone that I know. They're not thinking about masters degrees, getting married, internships, careers, morgatge payments, etc. Am I the crazy one? I mean fuck, I'm only 20. Pretty much living with parents and boyfriend rent free. Why do I worry about it so much?



Edit. Adding a bit more now.
Another thing that weighs on me a lot is that I've never really felt like I've contributed anything positive or productive to the world. Like I'm just a person that's here going through life and that's all I do. I don't feel like I contribute anything to my friendships/friend group and that they could easily lose me and not care or think twice about it. I don't feel like I have anything special or extraordinary to offer to anyone. I've tried actively contributing and supporting friends and all that good stuff but I feel like it just comes off as fake when I genuinely want to make these people's lives awesome. I dont feel like I really deserve anything that I have. Friends, things, opportunities, and do on. All these things are wasted on me, who isnt spectacular or special and doesn't deserve anything. This might possibly be grammatically unsound. Forgive me. I'm tired and it's really late and I can't sleep.



I feel a lot better now. I might add more but I should really get some sleep at least. I'd be amazed if anyone read through that wall-o-text. I needed it though. Maybe a hug too. And advice if anyone's ever been here before."

Both are rather lucrative in terms of compensation, though the bank will pay considerably more and last longer(early may through late august and possibly later if it can be arranged), and the research opprtunity will last from mid may to late july.

My game-plan for the future is to work in industry for a couple to a few years, then apply to a graduate school for a masters in game design/programming (probably).

qxdim,2,2012-03-15,"How do I approach this ""unique"" informational interview?",is_this_trickery,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qxdim/how_do_i_approach_this_unique_informational/,"Hi everyone

So, I have an informational interview coming up.  I've done my research on how this differs from a regular interview, but to me it seems like what I'm going to differs from an informational interview as well.  From what I know, informational interviews are more like asking the employer about what he does, industry advice, that sort of thing.  Not necessarily prodding for a career.  This is where my situation is a bit different.  

I got in touch with a friend of a former supervisor, and the friend said ""I have an internship position you might be able to fill, why don't you come in for an informational interview?""  

My interpretation of this was more like he wanted me to come in to talk about the details of the his company and the internship, but it's not a legitimate interview.  Just curious, how would you guys interpret what he said?  How would you prepare?  Perhaps most importantly for me, **how would you dress?**  

Also, regarding attire, I actually met this guy once or twice before, as he used to work at the place that I interned at.  His company now seems like it's a pretty relaxed agency similar to where I worked, and while I normally would just go with the suit, I feel like that'd be overdoing it.  

Thanks so much in advance, could really use some input on this.  

Edit:  Also, is it appropriate for me to write down my questions on a notepad and then pull out the notepad with the questions to make notes on his answers?"

My name is Dag Erik and I’m currently doing an internship as a video-journalist with the Central Coast Mariners FC in the Australian A-league.

Background story: I started working as a video-journalist in the swedish top soccer-club (my hometown-club) Helsingborgs IF 3,5 years ago, which I really love but the latest year I felt like I wanted to have an experience in another country, so why not try the same work but in another soccer-club abroad.

So I choosed the furthest destination away I could imagine and started looking for an internship in Australia. After many e-mails and phone calls I finally got one in Central Coast Mariners FC (currently the league leaders in the A-League). So from January I’ve been living near Gosford (about 1,5 hour trainride from Sydney) and I will be here at least til June.

And of course this would be my dream to work like this in different countries leagues, so if you know any team that will hire a video journalist after June, give me a suggestion!

Ask me anything!

Edit: I have also worked with the official Sweden Rock TV last years festival which may interest some:-)"

qx943,1,2012-03-14,"Ex and I still care about each other. It's been about 5 months. I want a second chance, but don't know if it's a good idea.",runaway8888,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/qx943/ex_and_i_still_care_about_each_other_its_been/,"/r/relationships, help me. 
I'm [F] 20, and he's also M[20]. 

He's had one gf which only lasted 4 months because he didn't feel the same in the end. Our relationship lasted about &lt;6 months in October. He said he wasn't sure if he wanted a relationship and basically, I was never really his gf because it was never official between that, and I was ok.

I felt the whole time, he was feeling pressured by his best guy friends to be chivalrous to me - he didn't need to be. I told him that. PDA and calling me his gf made him uncomfortable. I told him he didn't need to call me his gf (even though he did to his family...) or do PDA. I told him he didn't have to do anything that made him uncomfortable and that I just wanted him to be happy. I felt he was pressured by usual norms and trying to make me happy (in the wrong way). Originally we saw each other every 2 weeks, until we both landed an internship and were able to see each other every weekend - which I believe made him feel like I was a chore. (He said sometimes seeing his best friends is like a chore). He's told me things I don't think he's even told his best friends, and I know he has personal demons to deal with.

Long story short, after we broke up, he wouldn't leave me be. He would call me every so often on and off for a month until I told him I needed my space. Months later, he contacts me. I tell him it's not enough time and call him ignorant. Weeks later I feel bad and tell him I'm sorry; he takes it as a sign that I wanted to try being friends (it's my fault and I acknowledge it). Couldn't take it - still felt sad, mad, bittersweet and lonely memories whenever he was in my life. Told him /I/ couldn't be his friend and I needed space. 

Weeks later, he called and asked if it was ok he attended a mutual friend of ours party, where he knew I would be (I said yes). We did not talk too much, but we talked. Recently, he contacted me. I told him he is not allowed. Ended up crying and calling him on the phone, telling him he couldn't call... but then it ended up being I didnt' want to hang up and nor did he, so we talked on the phone. I told him I missed him and he said he did too. And he said he felt like he needed to check up on me every so often, and it wasn't pitying me and that he felt lonely. 

/r/relationships, my heart wants to ask him for another chance. I want to be with him, I want him to take away my loneliness, and I want to take away his. I want to help him through his demons. I felt like with him, it added more of a meaning to my life, and I wasn't depressed (which I have) - I was happy for 4 months straight (until it started getting bad). I felt like I became someone I really liked around him. And I know he doesn't have that many people to talk to. I've dated someone since our breakup, but there were no sparks like there was with him.
Isn't it to love someone to accept them for their flaws? I get it now, I understand he's introverted and that he likes his space. I understand he felt pressured. I am willing to be prepared for this now.Nothing worse can happen, we already lost each other. He was one of very, very, few that knew me well enough, inside out.

Reddit, what do I do? Am I being foolish and just lonely? Should I man my ground and stay away? Or should I follow my heart?"

I am planning to live somewhere near my employer (downtown/mag. mile area), which I've already accepted is going to be crazy expensive. What are some good hints, tips, suggestions, life-hacks, etc.. to living in downtown Chicago? I am moving from a much, much smaller metropolitan area where I'm used to driving a car. I'm assuming this is probably out of picture, so what up with bicycles? According to all of the posts today, that kind of seems like a whole thing, so I'll probably go ahead and write that off too.

I did this because I have no confidence in myself and thought I should take what I can get now, rather than wait for other better offers. I received emails from Company B about interviewing with them while they were on campus in February, and I took the interview because I thought it would be harmless and a very good experience since they give technically demanding interviews. I did unexpectedly well and received an offer from them. I wouldn't normally consider reneging, but the new offer is *far* superior. They provide incredible pay, housing and transportation support, and look really good on a resume (everyone knows the name of this company). It's an unbelievable opportunity.

Company A provides no housing or transportation support, which is a major issue for me since I will have to buy a car and find a place to live in a city I don't know. I knew this was an issue when I signed, though.

Extra points to consider:

* It has been a few months since I accepted, but still a few months till summer
* Company A may have a hard time finding a replacement since they were searching early on
* There's definitely no public transportation option at Company A's office
* Company A gave me a choice of which office to work at, but after choosing the office they forced me to a different office. This happened immediately after I accepted
* I have spoken to a school adviser. He said, essentially, that there won't be any side effects of breaking off the offer other than I likely won't be hired by them in the future (I'm ok with this), but it will be hard for them to find a replacement and he can't officially advise me to renege on an offer.
* Neither company knows I interviewed with the other. If I have to break it off, I would in no way tell them that it's because I'm going to another company
* This is my last summer to intern
* I understand that what I'm doing is likely very much frowned upon in professional ethics

Here's my main questions to you all:

* What would you do if you were me?
* Do I have an ethical obligation to Company A? Companies are willing to cut employees, and people interview for other jobs while hired all the time, but for some reason doing this on an internship feels extra wrong.
* If I break off the internship with Company A, how should I tell them? Send a general but apologetic email? Call the HR person who gave the offer? I don't owe them the full story, and it would complicate the issue to tell more than is necessary.
* How would you feel if you were the HR person dealing with a dropped intern?

I should note that I am leaning towards Company B, but I can be persuaded.
Thank you for any response at all, I am extremely conflicted and need objective help.

I get an interview at a company in late fall (a large one; let's call it company A) and they offer in December. I've been working to get a job offer at another company (Company B) a lot. They gave me a spring internship with intent to convert-to-hire and could not commit to a hire at that time. I accepted the job offer from Company A because I didn't want to pass up a sure thing.

I've had a fantastic experience working at Company B as an intern. Today Company B offered me a full time position. Said position (versus the full time at Company A) :

- Offers the opportunity for travel
- Offers a superior advancement path both inside and outside the organization
- Offers professional development in my intended area that no other company in the world has (that's not just their sales pitch; I've spoken to professors and others who have impressed this upon me)
- Will pay 33% more.

- Is an opportunity that is, in many ways, ""firsts"". As in, I'm the first one in my division to do this, I will become ready for my position (training) much more rapidly than anyone in the past, etc....

I am now at the point where I have to reject Company B and stick with my acceptance at Company A, or take the better job at company B and tell Company A I'm backing out.

Both companies are multinationals, by the way. I'm not screwing over a small/mid size business.

I do feel badly about it, but how should I approach this? Am I wrong for considering backing out of an acceptance?

I'm aware that Company A will surely blacklist me for life (getting any job there) for doing this. That's something I can live with."

First, some background: I did fairly well in high school, I had a 3.75 GPA, 1800 SATs, 30 ACTs, and I took 5 AP classes (most of which I scored a 4 or higher). Last year, I went to Drexel University in Philadelphia for a computer science major. Long story short, I hated my major and wasn't used to the amount of freedom I was given, and ended up with a 2.0 GPA that year. I ended up transferring to a local community college (general studies major). I took humanities, philosophy, and social science classes. My GPA last semester was 3.6, and I expect to do at least as well this semester. 

I'm planning on transferring to a 4 year school in the fall for either neuroscience or cognitive science. I'm applying to these schools: Temple University, Fitchburg State, Emory, Trinity College, Western Washington University, and Warner Pacific College. 

After undergrad, I'm planning on going to graduate school or medical school for something brain-related, possibly neuroscience, psychopharmacology, or psychiatry. I haven't made up my mind yet because I don't have any experience in the field. 

This is why I want to do an internship (in any cog/neuro/psych field) this summer, but have no idea where to begin searching for one. Any thoughts?

Also, I was wondering if there's anything I should know before entering the field, or if anyone has advice in general about undergrad, grad school, applying, etc. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!"

Hello,

I want to be an ios engineer but I don't have much experience. I went to school for a computer science degree (graduated in June). I did not intern anywhere because of my immigration issue at the time (couldn't get a work permit). I just got this resolved recently and looking for a job now. I didn't have any formal experiences but I have done some game programming side project and websites.


After college, I taught myself objective c, xocde, xcode interface builder and worked on an iphone app. It's a very simple app that counts scores for magic the gathering game. I downloaded a bunch of other similar free apps and improved mine to have better usability and nicer graphic. I released the app and it got about 1000+ something download in the first month or so. I then moved on to make a 2D game with cocos2d. The finished project was not that fun for me to play and I just decided not to release it. I also used Instruments to detect memory leaks, just to learn how to use the tool.


I found ios developing to be pretty fun relative to other things and I think I would find my career more rewarding.


My question to you is :

- How did you become a developer?

- Is there a chance that I can get started without experience? How do I make myself stand out for entry-level positions?

- While I am unemployed, what more about ios should I learn? What skills are particularly useful for an ios developer to have? What skills are valued by the employers?

- Other comments? I really, really, really want to make this happen.

I'm an intern at a non profit that's using Microsoft Sharepoint. Right now we have a .doc ""IT Handbook"" that details how to do things in Outlook, Word, some other internal software, etc. But we want to transfer the IT Handbook to the Sharepoint server so it can be searchable. Of course, this can be done by just uploading the file, but we want to transfer the handbook and convert its contents as a web page so we can use the Knowledge base or Wiki functions that come with Sharepoint. If we just upload the document itself, I'm not sure if people can search the contents of the file. We can't copy + paste it in because there are tons of screenshots in the document, and we can't paste those into the webpages unless I save them all then upload them, then put that image in the document.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

If there is a better, non-Sharepoint solution, that will work too, though my boss prefers to keep it within Sharepoint for consistency purposes."

I was originally in an ME program but transferred to a school that only offered MET so I switched programs.  

I'm having a difficult time in the job hunt despite having 40 weeks worth of internships / co-ops in engineering roles.  I've got an idea that the degree I'm pursuing is one reason my resume is getting kicked out in addition to the fact that I haven't graduated yet.  

In addition my current college is small and courses are offered so infrequently and by a terrible professor notorious for barely staying within ABET accreditation requirements.

I've wanted to go to graduate school at some point for a long time now and the lack of job prospects in my area is leading me towards a desire to go full steam into grad school soon after I finish undergrad.  

I've been told MET's have a hard time getting into ME due to lacking strong math and physics skills.  I finished my standard math requirements before transferring to MET, so my physics courses were all calculus-based.  I'm also finishing my math minor next fall semester in hopes it will help my prospects.

Anyone have any advice or experience to offer?

I am primarily interested in working in either a financial services sector or a software development division, but I am open to other fields. I have a 4.0 GPA in major and am willing to relocate if the internship is paid. 

One of my greatest strengths is my quantitative skills. I have a good record in mathematics, having tested out of multiple classes at my university as well have won first in a variety of university-sponsored competitions. I ascribe my success in this subject to my long-formed pursuit in the content of numbers predicting and mapping the world. I believe that my drive will materialize into my work, producing excellent results.

In addition, I am fluent in English and advanced in Spanish. I also am proficient and have programing experience with a variety of computer languages such as Java, OCaml, and a few others. I reinforce this statement with my 4.0 GPA in Computer Science. I believe that by learning advanced calculations and computer languages, one also receives insight into possible applications and predictions. Therefore, I believe my programming and high calculation experiences are an important asset I have.

I want to be an ios engineer but I don't have much experience. 
I went to school for a computer science degree (graduated in June). I did not intern anywhere because of my immigration issue at the time (couldn't get a work permit). 
I just got this resolved recently and looking for a job now. 
I didn't have any formal experiences but I have done some game programming side project and websites.


After college, I taught myself objective c, xocde, xcode interface builder and worked on an iphone app. It's a very simple app that counts scores for magic the gathering game. I downloaded a bunch of other similar free apps and improved mine to have better usability and nicer graphic. 
I released the app and it got about 1000+ something download in the first month or so. 
I then moved on to make a 2D game with cocos2d. The finished project was not that fun for me to play and I just decided not to release it.  
I also used Instruments to detect memory leaks, just to learn how to use the tool. 

I found ios developing to be pretty fun relative to other things and I think I would find my career more rewarding.

My question to you is :

- How did you become a developer?

- Is there a chance that I can get started without experience? How do I make myself stand out for entry-level positions? 

- While I am unemployed, what more about ios should I learn? What skills are particularly useful for an ios developer to have? What skills are valued by the employers?

- Other comments? I really, really, really want to make this happen. 

Thank you guys =)

qzuv2,2,2012-03-16,Conflicted graduating undergraduate psychology major would like to talk careers with Reddit. [cross-post from r/psychology],[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/qzuv2/conflicted_graduating_undergraduate_psychology/,"**TL;DR VERSION AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THE POST**

Hey guys, I know you get this kind of stuff all the time. I've been doing a lot of digging in the archives for answers to the questions I have. However I'm a weird one and the stuff I found doesn't exactly apply to me, so I figured I'd give my story and see what you think.

I'm a graduating senior that will have my BA in psychology this May. I haven't had all the time in the world to think about post-graduation plans (I only changed my major from account to psychology in the spring of my junior year). However, I do really love psychology, and science in general. I'm going to be taking at least a year off to find myself before committing to something that will shape the rest of my life.

I have been looking intently at PhD and PsyD programs specializing in neuropsychology and neuroscience. During my undergraduate education I've taken and LOVED classes in physiological, cognitive, abnormal, and statistics. I'm sort of a numbers guy and a fan of hard science over counseling's approach. I have also taken a master's level course in neuropsychology and am currently enrolled in a master's level counseling course. This is because I have been fascinated with neuropsychology. To me, it is amazing to be able to take all of the scientific knowledge of how the brain works and use it in such useful ways to benefit society - it really lets you see tangible results of research.

I have been toying with the idea of neuropsychology and neuroscience since I changed my major over a year ago and took my physiological psychology course with a cognitive neuroscientist. I really admire the fields and how they shun the stereotype of psychology. Not to say that counselors don't contribute value, they certainly do. However I've always been huge on the psycho-physiological relationship ever since my intro course. ""The mind is what the brain does"" can sum up my beliefs.

Neuroscience has always been extremely interesting to me, however I really don't think I would like to just do research and academia for the rest of my life. I am very interested in the topics, but I just can't see myself focusing so much on research (especially when I hear that the higher positions don't conduct research as much as manage research teams and write up reports for funding). While I love the idea, a big factor in my career path is what it is like to actually do something. I love tangible results. Working with clients and being able to apply and see what can be done with research is what drove me to neuropsychology.

Everything I have learned so far about neuropsychology has excited me. I love the material so much and feel that it's such a worthwhile discipline. Not only would I get to learn all of the interesting aspects of psychology and statistics, but I can apply them to problems. I didn't get into psychology to ""help people"" like so many others, however I believe that is a wonderful and fulfilling bonus that comes along with the joy of the work. The thing that has not sold me is that I'm really not sure how it would actually be working with the clinical population, and the educational requirements. While I might be one of (if not the best) student in my program (not to say much... my school isn't known for its psychology program and doesn't have many opportunities compared to larger state schools) I'm still afraid of PhD and PsyD programs. When I read professional research studies, it really floors me just how incredible they are. Not only are they well-versed in the area of study, but they can combine research design and statistics to test and draw conclusions about whatever they want. I don't think I am anywhere near that talented and the thought of a dissertation is frightening to me.

I understand there is also the option of going with a PsyD, which would be much more enjoyable and fit me better personally. But there are a number of problems I have seen. One huge one is funding. I hear you get plenty of scholarships and stipends with a PhD, where a PsyD will wade through 5+ years of debt. Another is that it seems like PsyDs are more limited to practice. While I don't want to spend my life researching or get into academia, I wouldn't be opposed to being able to use my knowledge in various fields and for different kinds of jobs in case the clinical job market doesn't take kindly to me.

I have also been looking at alternatives to the above career paths. I have a good background in both business and computer science. In high school I took 2 years of computer science classes (and the AP exam). While I didn't think I would like to do programming as a career, I am in love with technology and still retain the mathematical and logical skills I used. I'm also really interested in features and user interfaces. Optimization and facilitation are areas of interest, I enjoy making things more effective and efficient. I would love to incorporate psychology into that. During my career search I found the area of engineering/human factors/ergonomic psychology. It sounds incredibly interesting, but I really don't know much about it. I've looked at Wikipedia and the About.com pages, but I haven't been able to find out much more than what it's about. My main concerns are what exactly people do for jobs (day to day workplace experience), as well as what kind of engineering/mathematical background is necessary. Though I'm pretty good with statistics and enjoy it, I was not as good with my calculus courses. I didn't really like differentiation (and HATED integrals) but I managed to solve problems. Part of it I think stems from never having it explained correctly when I was young, but I would be prepared to learn. Another benefit is that it seems like a Master's degree is sufficient to lead into a lucrative career in this field, and that sounds like great news to me.

My business background is mainly focused in accounting, although I have taken other courses in management and marketing. I have also worked at an internship in corporate accounting for a large healthcare distribution company for two years, so I have real experience with how business is actually conducted. I have looked into industrial/organizational psychology, and while my skill set could definitely be put to good use in the field, I'm not exactly sure if my heart would be in it. Boosting efficiency and productivity sounds great, but I'm not sure if I would be interested in focusing on employees. I have not ruled this out, although I haven't been gravitating towards it either. It seems very close to HR, and I don't really know if I'd want to pursue that kind of career path. I'd definitely be interested in what a typical workday is like, however.

I refuse to be in a rush to make any decisions, however I would like to do as much research as possible into possible career paths that utilize my knowledge and love of psychology. Any advice would be so greatly appreciated, even if it's just a nudge in the direction of more information. I don't expect life-changing, personalized commentary. But I do believe that talking specifics with professionals and other knowledgeable individuals is infinitely more helpful than being left on my own. If you have read all of this so far, I can't express my thanks enough. I am serious about my career and want to do everything I can to ensure that I will love the 1/3 of my life I will be at my work, and the fact that others could care to help so much is really incredible.

For those who aren't able or don't want to read all of the above (although it would give much greater insight), I have included a TL;DR version of what I'd like to ask below:

**TL;DR VERSION BELOW**

- I am unsure about pursuing a graduate degree in neuroscience or neuropsychology. I am leaning towards neuropsychology, however I'm scared of the commitment to grad school without knowing what I'm getting into. If I don't want to do research or academia, but would like to keep options open for things other than just practicing clinical psychology, what kind of degree would I get and what kind of jobs would that qualify me for?

- What are some resources (that aren't wikipedia or about.com) that could give me insight into what the fields of engineering/human factors psychology and industrial/organizational psychology are about? I have also visited the APA's divisional websites, but they seem hard to navigate and devoid of real info.

- What are some things I can do with a BA in psychology to help facilitate making a career decision (besides work experience and contacting professionals about the field)?

- Thank you for taking the time to read this and perhaps respond. "

qzqr2,9,2012-03-16,Graduating in May. I have no real projects of my own. Better to work on some after I graduate before entering the workforce?,SnailHunter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qzqr2/graduating_in_may_i_have_no_real_projects_of_my/,"I'm graduating with my BS in CS this May. I always hear people saying that you should have a portfolio of all the projects you've worked on in your spare time, and that employers really look for that kind of stuff.  I've had two internships, but I haven't really done any projects on my own. 

 I would like to make some of my own mobile apps (as I already have some experience doing this with internships), but right now I'm way too busy with school. Would it be better to take some time off after I graduate to work on some project of my own that I would be proud of before I start interviewing for jobs? More importantly, does it look bad to employers if they see that you took time off after you graduated instead of getting a job right away? What if I wanted to take a year off to travel, for instance? Would this hurt me?

The big reason I really haven't done much in my spare time is that, for one, I didn't even know how to program before I began my CS degree. And for two, the little spare time I've had while pursing this degree has been spent socializing to ensure I keep some semblance of sanity. I think the biggest reason though is that I just wasn't experienced enough to even consider making something interesting on my own. As a senior, I definitely feel ready to make some things on my own now, and I really want to. I started working on something during spring break, but now that school's back I just don't have the time. 

So, to summarize my question, would it better to take some time off after I graduate (maybe a few months or more), or perhaps just work part time, so I can work on a project of my own that I could be proud of and show off to employers? Does it look really bad if I have nothing to show except the stuff that I did in my internships (which isn't really that interesting)?

Also, what should I even say if an employer asks me about my own projects and I don't really have any?"

Would they take a pre-professional student to do something like that if I were only working there over the summer? Also, would I be better off getting my CPhT before summer? I'm leaning against that because I'll have my internship license next summer anyway. Finally, what are some job prospects outside the retail world? My summer home is in Cleveland, OH."

every time i felt allot of improvements in a lot of aspects in life. i`d even go as far as saying i was becoming ( but not reaching by a long shot :P ) the person i`ve always wanted to be.

in my current try i`ve added sport 2 times a week and i`ve started a internship. also i`ve redecorated my room to `banish` my habbit fap places which seems to help even better then i dared to dream about. 

i`m in 9 days now, but my increased social skills, energie, mood and motivation all went down the drain again and i`ve felt pretty shitty the last 4 days. on the other side my urge to fap or watch porn was almost non existend the whole time.

can anyone tell me if this is normal? feeling shitty all the time is a huge problem for staying motivated, not because i can`t handle it but because i feel like nofap isn`t working the way i expected it to.

I'm pretty sure I spoke here about my internsip in the past. Yesterday I decided to give it up. I was hired as an intern to build a website and do general IT admin for a company. Getting the website built was supposed to be my top priority but this wasn't exactly easy given the very slow pace of feed back I was getting from management.

By the end of December and the start of January I had provided them with everything the required and the general manager was happy with it. Then everything slowed down even more, the website was ready to go online I was just waiting for the go ahead which I never got.

So yesterday evening before I left I was turning off all the computers in the office. One of the managers had left their email open and a few other windows. As I was closing them I noticed a website template using graphics and images that I had made for the company website.

I know it wasn't the most professional thing to do but I had a look through all this stuff just to see what was going on. From what I can see The company I work for has been dealing with another web design company to build a website for them also!
So for the past two months or so I've been sitting at my desk like an idiot while they have hired someone else to do my job. I was never told about any of this. Whenever I asked about the progress of my project I was just told to work away at it and they would deal with it when they had time! 
I don't understand it if they weren't happy with it why wasn't I told? and why did they tell me to keep working at my project when they already have made up there mind to go with someone else?
I've no idea where I stand in any of this but I'm not very happy with the whole situation and I see no reason why I should go back on Tuesday.

qz3v7,6,2012-03-16,Conflicted graduating undergraduate psychology major would like to talk careers with Reddit.,[deleted],psychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/qz3v7/conflicted_graduating_undergraduate_psychology/,"**TL;DR VERSION AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THE POST**

Hey guys, I know you get this kind of stuff all the time. I've been doing a lot of digging in the archives for answers to the questions I have. However I'm a weird one and the stuff I found doesn't exactly apply to me, so I figured I'd give my story and see what you think.

I'm a graduating senior that will have my BA in psychology this May. I haven't had all the time in the world to think about post-graduation plans (I only changed my major from account to psychology in the spring of my junior year). However, I do really love psychology, and science in general. I'm going to be taking at least a year off to find myself before committing to something that will shape the rest of my life.

I have been looking intently at PhD and PsyD programs specializing in neuropsychology and neuroscience. During my undergraduate education I've taken and LOVED classes in physiological, cognitive, abnormal, and statistics. I'm sort of a numbers guy and a fan of hard science over counseling's approach. I have also taken a master's level course in neuropsychology and am currently enrolled in a master's level counseling course. This is because I have been fascinated with neuropsychology. To me, it is amazing to be able to take all of the scientific knowledge of how the brain works and use it in such useful ways to benefit society - it really lets you see tangible results of research.

I have been toying with the idea of neuropsychology and neuroscience since I changed my major over a year ago and took my physiological psychology course with a cognitive neuroscientist. I really admire the fields and how they shun the stereotype of psychology. Not to say that counselors don't contribute value, they certainly do. However I've always been huge on the psycho-physiological relationship ever since my intro course. ""The mind is what the brain does"" can sum up my beliefs.

Neuroscience has always been extremely interesting to me, however I really don't think I would like to just do research and academia for the rest of my life. I am very interested in the topics, but I just can't see myself focusing so much on research (especially when I hear that the higher positions don't conduct research as much as manage research teams and write up reports for funding). While I love the idea, a big factor in my career path is what it is like to actually do something. I love tangible results. Working with clients and being able to apply and see what can be done with research is what drove me to neuropsychology.

Everything I have learned so far about neuropsychology has excited me. I love the material so much and feel that it's such a worthwhile discipline. Not only would I get to learn all of the interesting aspects of psychology and statistics, but I can apply them to problems. I didn't get into psychology to ""help people"" like so many others, however I believe that is a wonderful and fulfilling bonus that comes along with the joy of the work. The thing that has not sold me is that I'm really not sure how it would actually be working with the clinical population, and the educational requirements. While I might be one of (if not the best) student in my program (not to say much... my school isn't known for its psychology program and doesn't have many opportunities compared to larger state schools) I'm still afraid of PhD and PsyD programs. When I read professional research studies, it really floors me just how incredible they are. Not only are they well-versed in the area of study, but they can combine research design and statistics to test and draw conclusions about whatever they want. I don't think I am anywhere near that talented and the thought of a dissertation is frightening to me.

I understand there is also the option of going with a PsyD, which would be much more enjoyable and fit me better personally. But there are a number of problems I have seen. One huge one is funding. I hear you get plenty of scholarships and stipends with a PhD, where a PsyD will wade through 5+ years of debt. Another is that it seems like PsyDs are more limited to practice. While I don't want to spend my life researching or get into academia, I wouldn't be opposed to being able to use my knowledge in various fields and for different kinds of jobs in case the clinical job market doesn't take kindly to me.

I have also been looking at alternatives to the above career paths. I have a good background in both business and computer science. In high school I took 2 years of computer science classes (and the AP exam). While I didn't think I would like to do programming as a career, I am in love with technology and still retain the mathematical and logical skills I used. I'm also really interested in features and user interfaces. Optimization and facilitation are areas of interest, I enjoy making things more effective and efficient. I would love to incorporate psychology into that. During my career search I found the area of engineering/human factors/ergonomic psychology. It sounds incredibly interesting, but I really don't know much about it. I've looked at Wikipedia and the About.com pages, but I haven't been able to find out much more than what it's about. My main concerns are what exactly people do for jobs (day to day workplace experience), as well as what kind of engineering/mathematical background is necessary. Though I'm pretty good with statistics and enjoy it, I was not as good with my calculus courses. I didn't really like differentiation (and HATED integrals) but I managed to solve problems. Part of it I think stems from never having it explained correctly when I was young, but I would be prepared to learn. Another benefit is that it seems like a Master's degree is sufficient to lead into a lucrative career in this field, and that sounds like great news to me.

My business background is mainly focused in accounting, although I have taken other courses in management and marketing. I have also worked at an internship in corporate accounting for a large healthcare distribution company for two years, so I have real experience with how business is actually conducted. I have looked into industrial/organizational psychology, and while my skill set could definitely be put to good use in the field, I'm not exactly sure if my heart would be in it. Boosting efficiency and productivity sounds great, but I'm not sure if I would be interested in focusing on employees. I have not ruled this out, although I haven't been gravitating towards it either. It seems very close to HR, and I don't really know if I'd want to pursue that kind of career path. I'd definitely be interested in what a typical workday is like, however.

I refuse to be in a rush to make any decisions, however I would like to do as much research as possible into possible career paths that utilize my knowledge and love of psychology. Any advice would be so greatly appreciated, even if it's just a nudge in the direction of more information. I don't expect life-changing, personalized commentary. But I do believe that talking specifics with professionals and other knowledgeable individuals is infinitely more helpful than being left on my own. If you have read all of this so far, I can't express my thanks enough. I am serious about my career and want to do everything I can to ensure that I will love the 1/3 of my life I will be at my work, and the fact that others could care to help so much is really incredible.

For those who aren't able or don't want to read all of the above (although it would give much greater insight), I have included a TL;DR version of what I'd like to ask below:

**TL;DR VERSION BELOW**

- I am unsure about pursuing a graduate degree in neuroscience or neuropsychology. I am leaning towards neuropsychology, however I'm scared of the commitment to grad school without knowing what I'm getting into. If I don't want to do research or academia, but would like to keep options open for things other than just practicing clinical psychology, what kind of degree would I get and what kind of jobs would that qualify me for?

- What are some resources (that aren't wikipedia or about.com) that could give me insight into what the fields of engineering/human factors psychology and industrial/organizational psychology are about? I have also visited the APA's divisional websites, but they seem hard to navigate and devoid of real info.

- What are some things I can do with a BA in psychology to help facilitate making a career decision (besides work experience and contacting professionals about the field)?

- Thank you for taking the time to read this and perhaps respond. "

qz1s2,1,2012-03-16,"A final, humble, plea.",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qz1s2/a_final_humble_plea/,"TLDR at bottom, but it really lobotomies the story of my situation.

Most of my life I've been completely miserable. I don't really know why, I just always feel alone, even with my best of friends at times. In high school I thought I was a complete loser...even as I walked off the field being crowned homecoming king. I always felt like an idiot even though I walked in late to my act without a calculator or a god damn clue and wound up with a 31 and used that to segue my way into a full ride scholarship, not to bad for an idiot I thought. I got to school and got heavy into drugs. They made me happy. They were not to be my ultimate problem though. That would be my parents.

They are divorced, have been since I was 4 weeks old. Dads rich, moms poor, lived with mom, visited dad, that old story.

I am at msu in my second semester, spring 2010. A bad LSD trip has convinced me to profess my hidden/repressed feelings for my best friend. She makes me feel like no body else can or will. Let me rephrase this again, more clearly; the only times in my adult life that I have been happy, were because this person, and this person alone, was simply there, talking to me, and genuinely caring that I existed.  She feels the same towards me, and I get to spend the greatest time of my life with her. Things are great. I'm getting off drugs, im happy, truly happy, and at peace with myself and others for the first time in my life. Fast forward one month. I get sick.I have to go home on medical leave, we end up taking a break, mutually, I'm so sick I can't leave the bed. The doctors say its mono. I cry in front of my mom over my loss of my new found happiness and love and she sends me to a psych ward. I get out 3 days later. I see a psych, get put on every medication you can name, get my sanity and mind pushed through zaps, loops, to the very edge. I get back to school in the fall. Things between me and the only girl I will ever love (20 since none come close) questions my sanity and is seeing someone. I drink heavily and fail. Get pulled out of school by dad. At this point he was running my finances, paying my bills. I thought he had control of my tuition grant. Nope, he just forged my name and lied, forcing me to come home, and go to community college for the past year and work for him full time, because he knows I don't have the will to do anything about it anymore.

My mom tried to kill herself last year. Luckily I was home, and with my encyclopedic pharmacology knowledge I knew I could stabilize her long enough until the emt got there, she ended up totally fine. She hated me for it. He wanted her friend to save her. Her friend never showed up, or if she did, it would have been much too late. A month after that I had to sleep outside. My mother, the one I saved, was going to press assault charges, for yelling at 1am when I woke up to her screaming at my poor crying sister balled up on the kitchen floor ""you are not sending my sister to the nut house and fucking her life up like you did mine because you are tired of being a mom"". She called her bf crying saying I was going to hit her then 911 and said out now. Had fun explaining to dad why I was leaping on the lawn o dad when he picked me up for work.

Oh yea, and those psych ward and psych visits? My mom hid the bills from me. My credit is shit and I'm still in debt. I honestly should have watched the bitched choke on her vomit. I'd be happier too, yea I'm fucked in the head, but you would be too if your mom left you with a babysitter that just locked you in the hallway closet screaming for fucking hours.

So here I am. I got my own apt and car now. Most if not all my friends have abandoned me, or ignor me, the girl of my dreams is now my long distance ex girlfriend I will never get over, and I haven't felt a happy or non-alone moment since I left college freshman year. I wake up every day wondering what I did to deserve this. I look at me, and my mom. I try to do the right thing every day, my mom throws m under a bus for a hundred bucks. She owes me her life and she fucking hates me. She's evil and does nothing but wrong, used that suicide attempt to guilt trip her new husband to the altar and is on her honeymoon in the virgin islands now. Me? The one responsible for letting her have all that? What good karma reward do I get? To wake up every day crying. Take orders from my fucked up family, at their ass backwards company, doing a job that anyone lse would get paid 6x the amount, but I get minimum wage to make web pages, owners manuals build machines, order parts, find new, cheaper parts, fix the network, all shit these old, technologically impaired ppl cannot do without huge outsourcing costs.

Here's the icing on the shit cake of my life. The girl I keep talking about visited over spring break. It was great to see her again and talk. It was kinda awkward, but in a good sense, if that even makes sense. Anyway, I get to saying how after ll this fucking shit I'll finally be able to get back on track and to school in the fall. Well fuck my face, she is moving back here in the fall to do her internship at our old high school. Fan. Fucking. Tas tick.


Now, I'm a logical man, I know there is probably no one who gives a fuck to read all that, and I dont blame you, you got your own problems and that shit is depressing, so let me try to tldr this, because I need help so bad reddit, and I've gone to th best, and the rest, it's up to you and me. This ldr is a gross oversimplification but,

TLDR: I was forced fom the love of my life by my parents, and I will never find anyone close to her, or get over her. I may significantly alter my long term life goals if I can still get her back, but I don't even know how she really feels now. She's the only person/thing that ever made me feel happy, or loved,or wanted, or like I fit in. She's the only reason I wake up and go through hell every day, crying, in complete agony. Without the hope of her, I'd kill myself right now. I know how wrong that I, but it's true, and no amount of drugs, legal or not, therapy, anything, has been able to change that, no matter how hard I try, no matter how much I want it to. Please help me not be that crazy guy that kills himself over a girl that doesn't want him reddit, idk if that's the case, but it may be, I'm so alone, just, please help me :("
qz1og,4,2012-03-16,My Story So Far (First post in this sub),historic66,Buddhism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/qz1og/my_story_so_far_first_post_in_this_sub/,"*Note: I'm writing in a stream of consciousness, so I apologize in advance if this becomes a TLDR post*

I was raised in church. By raised in church, I mean I was [dedicated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedication_%28Baptist_ceremony%29), and attended often, usually three times per week (twice on Sundays and once on Wednesdays). I went through every level (I use that word as though one might use it to describe grades in school) of Sunday school, attended [bible school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacation_Bible_School) until they would no longer let me and attended church camp from fourth grade (the first year one is allowed to attend) until I was a senior in high school (the last year one is allowed to attend as a camper). I also served as a counselor to ""junior camp"" once I was in high school and lead the band in my youth group for almost six years.

To sum up, I was about as dedicated to ""Jesus' team"" as one could get.

In the summer of 2002, the youth pastor I had always known abruptly left, giving no reason for doing so. Two weeks later, rumors began to spread about the senior pastor following his intern's (a different man than the youth pastor) abrupt departure. After several weeks of testimony before the [Deacons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon), it was revealed that the pastor had engaged in an inappropriate homosexual relationship with the intern and resigned.

During the next few months, our church and youth group, now both in shambles, struggled to get back to ""normal"". During this time, the adults in the church seemed to be far more concerned with their own wants and needs, neglecting the youth entirely. It was during this time that my band became the tightest and most creative of our entire tenure. It was also during this time that the youth began a rotation of ""taking turns"" delivering the youth sermons on Wednesday nights.

Eventually, a former Deacon stepped up to lead us until both a senior pastor and youth pastor could be found.

Both of the aforementioned hires turned out to be worse than having no official leadership at all. The senior pastor was a money hungry, [hyper-Calvinist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-Calvinism) who often used the church funds for person gain and neglected the congregation. The youth pastor was an immature liar who saw his job not as his [calling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_%28religious%29), but as a stepping stone to senior pastor. After he verbally embarrassed one of my close friends during a sermon and asked him to leave, I stopped attending church on a regular basis. For the second and final time, I also left the band I had been playing with, more or less, since I entered the seventh grade.

In the fall of 2007, I was attending a commuter college and began seeing my first serious girlfriend. It was during this relationship that I lost my virginity. My parents, upon discovering this, [kicked me out](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m67gf/need_some_help_with_acquiring_a_car/) and sold my car. Although I attended church a few times during our relationship, my days as a regular attender had come to an official end. This was also the event which caused me to look, critically, at everything I had been told growing up, especially considering the complete contradiction between what my parents had taught me and what they were doing.

Since then, I have attended church only a handful of times (for various reasons), but have ceased believing in any sort of higher power. Also since then, I have begun to research religion a great deal and am amazed daily with the [inconsistency of the bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency_of_the_Bible) and with the absolute lack of common sense Christians seem to have. 

Someone posted something [here](http://reddit.com/r/atheism) not long ago that mentioned how it takes a long time to ""cleanse"" someone of a religious upbringing. I had never thought of it until then, but now I notice it constantly. From time to time, something from Christianity will be presented to me (the story of Jesus' birth as told during Christmas at a local [theme park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Dollar_City), for example) and I will get chills, only to remember moments later that the story is bullshit.

Since joining reddit, I have been an avid follower of [/r/athesim](http://reddit.com/r/atheism) while at the same time researching Buddhism more and more and I have to say...it clicks...on so many levels.

To close, I want to say ""Hello"" to you all and I look forward to discussing the teachings of the Buddha with you."

I remember while in 5th and 6th grade going to bed and thinking of killing myself. I am a junior in college now. I have cut myself, I have tried to hang myself, I have punched myself, I have tried to over dose, and so on. 

I got a job once I turned 16. I was working 40+ hours a week up until college. This just made it worse. I didn't make many friends at school since I was always working. It was a shitty Subway/DQ job. I worked there up until college, then worked there over the next summer. Always 40+ hours a week. Last summer I got a different job since I didn't want to go back. This time at a deli. Was working 40+ hours a week all summer with people I hated. Just as bad as the other. 

Now for this summer. I am a Mathematics major and I have applied to countless internships, 10+ REU programs and I know I won't hear back from any of them. I have decent grades, but I'm not a minority, or female. Just an average white guy. My girl friend applies to two things and hears back that she is in an REU a month later.

[How hard is it to get your foot in the door as a columnist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41c3ss?context=5)|It's difficult to give you a very good answer on that. I guess I would say, It's hard. It's so difficult to make journalism work as a career these days that I advise most young people I meet to look for some other kind of work. At the same time, there are so many ways for aspirants to showcase their work that it also seems more likely that talented people will get spotted and rewarded.   The other thing is that there's a lot of luck involved in this business. One of the main things I have going for me is that I was born in the right year -- 1978, which meant I got on the job market in 2000. That was the peak of the dot-com boom. Everyone was hiring. I got a job at Wired.com; I was the last person they hired before layoffs commenced.   I was lucky enough to ride out the bust at Wired, and then I got a job at Salon -- which was also still struggling -- and then, when the economy looked better in the mid-to-late 2000s, I went to Slate. If I'd been born one year later, my career wouldn't have taken off nearly as smoothly. 
[You write for 4 different sites. Does that mean 4x the money or 4x the work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41c3qd?context=5)|In short, yes: 4x money and 4x work.  I consider Slate my main home on the Web, and Fast Company the main place where I write for print (although my FC articles appear online, too; it's just that when I write them, I think of writing for a print audience). I also write different kinds of articles for different sites -- for the NYT, I mainly write about home tech devices (like white noise machines or thermostats) that I wouldn't write about elsewhere.  But yes: I think of myself as being in the writing business, meaning that I write to make money as much as I write because I find the job enjoyable. 
[What's the difference between a print audience and an online audience? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41cotl?context=5)|I don't think the audience is different. It's the experience that's different: People read deeper into print stories than they do online. Online, we read more stuff, but we read less into each piece. In print, we read less stuff, but we usually finish articles.

It must get overwhelming.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41c4o8?context=5)|Yes. Yes yes yes yes.   I think a lot of people suspect that gadget reviewers get into this business in order to get a lot of free stuff. Most reputable tech writers, though, are obsessive about returning all the tech we get. The only thing that you have going for you in this business -- which lacks licensing, credentialing, exams, etc -- is your reputation. And the only way to maintain that is to not take stuff.  I will say that returning all this stuff is a logistical nightmare. I work alone, at home. I don't have interns or assistants. My home office is always packed with gadgets and boxes that I need to return. I spend about two or three weekend days a month handling it all. It's a nightmare that makes you hate gadgets.  On the other hand, I've found that getting all this stuff has changed my own appetite for consumption. Because I get to open so many gadgets I don't experience a thrill, anymore, of getting new stuff. And for most gadgets, that thrill is the best part. So I find myself wanting a lot less stuff than I used to in the past.

Something political you retweeted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41cdgk?context=5)|Yes, I think it would have to be the bookstore article. (Don't Support Your Local Bookstore! [Link to fm4.fm](http://fm4.fm/yMORGH)  Salman Rushdie called me a moron on Twitter, which I took to be a fatwa. 
[Dang, did you just Godwin your own IAmA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41dl4w?context=5)|Yes, I did. I was wondering if Godwining my own IAmA would break the Internet. Alas no. 
[How does writing for 4 different companies work logistically?  i.e., who are you a full employee of with health care et al., and are you a freelancer for the others, or are you technically a self-employed freelancer for everyone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41cfow?context=5)|I'm technically self-employed. I have contracts with these companies and get paid as a 1099 contractor. (I recently set up an S-corp to deal with all this.)   I get healthcare from my wife's job. Before I was married, I bought my own. I can't wait for Obamacare to kick in.

Indians go back several generations in South Africa; my own extended family has been there since the late 1800s.   My parents and my sister and I moved to California in 1987, when I was 8 years old.   My name: People always mistake me for Iranian, since Farhad is a common Persian name. It turns out it's also a popular name for boys among South African Muslims. 
[Apple's been seriously criticised for the conditions in its factories, most notably by Link to mikedaisey.blogspot.com and the NYT but tech journalists don't seem willing to cover this properly. Are you - or perhaps other tech reporters like Siegler and Pogue - too conflicted to take this on? Would serious coverage of Apple's \(or other tech giants'\) working conditions cause you to lose access to the latest gadgets, software, etc? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41csqd?context=5)|I really don't have any access at Apple that I can lose. I don't get early stuff from them, I only get grudgingly invited to their press events (about half of them), and they never answer my requests. I think this is true of nearly all tech journalists; Apple offers little access, so there isn't much to lose.   Most of the tech sites I read have covered this story quite well. But I think there's a sense of helplessness about it: We don't know what to do about Apple's labor conditions, or what to tell our readers to do.   A boycott? The trouble with that is we'd have to boycott all electronics. Nothing is made in conditions we Americans wouldn't consider punishing.  There's also the argument that for many of these workers, a job at an Apple factory is better than no job at all. And that's really the future we're heading to: More and more of these plants are being automated. In the future, your iPad isn't going to be made by workers who get paid higher wages and work shorter hours. It's going to be made by robots who get paid nothing and work all the time. 
[Thanks for the reply! I see what you mean about access; do you think there's nothing in the speculation about Pogue being left out of the Mountain Lion preview? Link to www.washingtonpost.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41d3im?context=5)|No, Pogue wasn't left out of the preview. See: [Link to daringfireball.net](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/18/jumping-to-conclusions.)
[You mentioned that megapixels is a buzzword to try to sell cameras to the population. I gotta say, even I have fallen for that. What exactly should I be looking for in a digital camera?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41cfy2?context=5)|You should be looking for good lenses, a big sensor, and speed to take pictures and focus quickly.  I suggest you read The Wirecutter, Brian Lam's new review site. He slices through all the specs to tell you what's the best of a certain class of gadget.
[Why does Slate hate mattress companies? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41c5rq?context=5)|We just do, OK. Isn't it obvious? They suck.   (I think you're referring to Seth Stevenson's [Link to www.slate.com](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/shopping/2000/11/going_to_the_mattresses.html) I loved that piece!) 
[It's wrong because you say so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41dwzf?context=5)|It's also wrong because most style manuals say so. And typographers. 
[Very cool to see you jump in on IAmA, Farhad. What devices make up your personal tech list these days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41cbbw?context=5)|I've got an iPhone 4, a Macbook Air, a Windows 7 desktop I built myself with two huge displays and an Apple wireless keyboard. I also have a Sony nex 3 camera. 
[Whatever happened with growing your tomatoes in the containers? I read your article last year and it was to late to try it in my area. How did it turn out for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41cdhl?context=5)|It was fantastic. I'm going to do it again this year.  I had one problem: Late in the summer, the plants contracted some kind of fungus. This I think this happened because one of my seedlings had it and spread it to the rest. This time I'm going to quit being organic and start spraying them with a fungicide early.
[How much leeway do you get from Slate for choosing your column topics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41cjzb?context=5)|I get a lot of leeway from Slate. (Case in point: I recently wrote about how people should wear pajamas all the time.) If I have an idea that strays from my main beat, I often send it to our internal email list, and if it sparks a lot of discussion, I'll usually write it. 
[It really opened up my eyes to how much of current tech is impacted by old tech \(as in, the use of QWERTY and double spaces from the typewriter\). Really fascinating stuff.   Have you ever had an idea you thought would be awesome only to have your internal email test turn it up as a dud? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41cq2x?context=5)|Yes. I send many ideas, mostly as I think of them. Often they go nowhere. I also keep a big .txt notepad of column ideas, but I only get to a small fraction of them.
[Are you implying there are fewer programmers now than there were in the past?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41ey5o?context=5)|No. I'm saying there are more people writing in type now than ever before. The vast majority of them are using proportional space fonts. 
[I have worked in the IT field for 20 years and in that time I have acquired many friends and acquaintances who also work in the field. We often wonder aloud why Slate allows you to write about technology. Specifically technology in the workplace and the enterprise. We pass around your articles and shudder to think that readers are subjected to your misinformed observations and make decisions based on them.   It's gotten to the point that when someone mentions they were reading an obviously misguided tech article someone else will invariably ask, ""Was it a Manjoo article?"" The response to the question is not as important as the fact the question is asked in the first place but not surprisingly a fair percentage of the responses are along the lines of, ""Ahhh, yeah."" Sometimes followed with a, ""Sorry, never mind.""  It is obvious on its face that you lack a basic understanding of IT so my question is why does Slate, an otherwise seemingly reliable and trustworthy site, allow you to write on a subject you know very little about? Is it because there is no one there that knows enough about technology to question your articles? More specifically, do you think you suffer from the Dunning-Kruger effect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41fxqb?context=5)|So let me get this straight: You and your colleagues in the IT department didn't appreciate the article in which I questioned your entire reason for being? In which I said, ""In the information age, most companies' success depends entirely on the creativity and drive of their workers. IT restrictions are corrosive to that creativity—they keep everyone under the thumb of people who have no idea which tools we need to do our jobs but who are charged with deciding anyway.""
[If you had to pare down to one electronic device/gadget and use it for the rest of your life, what would you choose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41c97d?context=5)|My Macbook Air. It's the best computer I've ever used.   I would hate to pare down to one, though. I do love my dual-monster-screen Windows 7 desktop PC. And I can't do without my iPhone.  But if I had to have just one, it'd be the Air.
[Are Dana Stevens and Emily Bazelon as awesome irl as they are on their respective podcasts? And how cool is John Dickerson?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41c8hd?context=5)|But since I live in California and they're all on the East Coast, my main connection with them is also through their podcasts. I love love Slate podcasts. Everyone should listen. 
[Where do you get your ideas.leads for your articles? How closely do you follow HN and progit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41crak?context=5)|I read a lot of tech sites. I spend most of my day reading the Web trying to think of ideas. Hacker News is one of the main places I check. 
[You called the iPhone 4s unimaginative the day before Steve Jobs died. Was it strange to criticize an Apple device, only to have the company's founder die the next day? What impact did the article have on your feeling towards Jobs' death, if at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41cf1d?context=5)|I don't remember feeling bad about that. I think it was probably because I was expecting the death to be soon, so I wasn't surprised it happened right then.  I felt really bad when Jobs died. I don't usually feel sad when celebs die; I didn't know them IRL, so their deaths wouldn't mark an absence for me. But for Jobs, what I mourned was the loss of more great innovations. I also live in Palo Alto and work in an industry that reveres Jobs, so everyone I know was talking about it.
[One: What tech sites \(besides Techmeme\) do you read daily? What kind of material do you expect from each? For example: You get your gossip fix at Tech Crunch? Your long reads from...?  Two: What sites do you wish you read more of? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41kufw?context=5)|1) I guess I'm like Sarah Palin: I read all of them. I really try to, anyway. I spend a lot of my day looking at aggregaotors like Techmeme, Hacker News, Google News, HuffPo, Drudge, Kottke, BoingBoing, Buzzfeed, etc. I also check out big tech sites like TechCrunch, AllThingsD, Wired, TheVerge, the NYT, etc. But while I'm doing all that, I'm mainly looking at Twitter, which has become my main personalized news feed for news. I see all kinds of interesting links there; Twitter sparks more story ideas than anything else for me.  2) Cooking sites. I spend a lot of my day wondering what I'm going to make for dinner. I love cooking and wish I had more time to read foodie pages. Also, I wish I had more time during the day to read longer articles. I usually have to push magazine articles to beyond the workday, because I don't have the attention span to read long stuff while I'm browsing the Web. I wish I did.
[Three: What's your biggest pet peeve in tech journalism today? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41kufw?context=5)|3) Pet peeves? Hmm, not many major ones. I hate when people are quick to flash EXCLUSIVE in their headlines and I hate all the tech writing about tech writing and journalism, which nobody outside our biz cares about. But usually if something bothers me, I stop reading.
[Do you hate the titles your articles get sometimes?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41efct?context=5)|Yes, sometimes. Rarely but sometimes. 
[How many dudes did you have to blow to get your first job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41di3y?context=5)|Way too few.
[I thoroughly enjoy your articles, and while I don't always agree with you \(*cough*twospacesisfine*cough*\) I always enjoy the perspective you share. I do have a gripe, though. I mostly read Slate when I'm in public on my phone. I'd love to listen to your podcasts with Emily Yoffe about e-tiquette, but I never have earbuds with me. Any chance you could post some transcripts on the site?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41kaw5?context=5)|We do post transcripts! The link appears on every Digital Manners podcast page. Look for the link, you'll see it!
[Are you surprised by how many people subscribe to you on Facebook? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41frwe?context=5)|Yes! It's insane and I don't understand it.
[Farhad, first off I'm a huge fan. I check slate daily to read your articles. This is so wierd since my last post \(10 minutes ago\) was about a great book you recommended which I now love, Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter.  Anyway, I know I'm late to this show but would love it if you'd still answer this. Do you have any stories of fellow slate contributer the late Christopher Hitchens? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41i2j8?context=5)|I do not have any Hitchens stories. I never met him, in fact. Being all the way out in California, I rarely meet most of my Slate colleagues.
[Does it bother you that you feel as if you have to kiss so much ass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qxytr/im_farhad_manjoo_technology_columnist_for_slate/c41c4bp?context=5)|I don't feel I do have to kiss so much ass. I think if you look at my record, I've been critical of every company I cover.   But it's kind of silly for me to defend myself that way. It *does* bother me that there are folks who do think I kiss so much ass. So if you care to expand on your complaint a bit more, I'll be happy to talk about it.

I have no idea if these are appropriate for a girl my age and my size (I'm petite, 5'1). Also, I don't know about color. I generally like black since I wear a lot of blue/darker colors and denim, but I wonder if brown/beige might be more appropriate for a professional office setting. I'd like for this bag to be my ""main bag,"" so if I can find one that would be appropriate for both casual settings and the workplace, that'd be fantastic.

Any advice would be appreciated!"

I guess this is also a throwaway account. 

I could write a whole lot to recap our relationship and explain things but I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

Ex and I were really in love...dated over a year. Broke up last February. We are 23. 

Ex and I both got really stressed out towards the end of college. He was stressed out/depressed about family issues and about finding a job.

I was experiencing some EXTREMELY difficult emotional issues that were in part triggered by our relationship and in part triggered by my family. Traumatic things happened to me in my childhood and I kind of relived the emotions sometimes in our relationship--not my ex's fault, but because I never got therapy to really heal. I would hide my pain from him because I didn't want to burden him with talking about it for the thousandth time, and I would grow really depressed and irritable. Seriously, although I was in love with him it was a dark time for me and it had a strain on our relationship. This coupled with things currently happening with my family were putting me through some unbearable emotions. 

Ex also had his shortcomings, although was all around a good boyfriend. I think some of the inconsiderate things he did were largely exasperated by my emotional state and kind of snowballed into bigger problems than they needed to be. 

Ex decided things couldn't continue like this and spontaneously, without thinking for things longer than half a day, decided we needed to end things. He claimed that I wasn't losing him but he didn't want our relationship to be completely ruined. I sobbed, assuming no man would break up with me unless he didn't want me anymore, and left, completely heartbroken, unable to talk about things.

We kept in touch (he always calls me every day, no matter what)--although I tried to cut off contact numerous times, convinced he must not be in love with me anymore or not desire me anymore. I was unable to really stick to my guns for any significant length of time. I felt like the breakup was a blow to my self esteem, like I had been ""demoted"" from girlfriend to....who knows. He says that is ridiculous.

For the most part we talk every day, just as we did when we were together.

We have both been 100% loyal to each other sexually and emotionally since we broke up. A few times, in an emotionally charged moment, I've told him we should see other people and he says he doesn't want to, but if I feel like I need to go on dates, he won't like it but he can't stop me, but he won't date. 

Six months after we broke up he moved back home to a city a few hours away. After we broke up we were seeing each other about once a month. Since he moved, we don't see each other more than every few months. This is mostly because he is completely broke, and even his car has been wrecked (long story). We are both trying to get off our feet, I'm starting grad school in a few months, and he is preoccupied with an internship and living with his parents.

A few months after we broke up I started crying and asked why we couldn't be together and he said he felt extremely stressed about finding a job and he felt the timing was off. He said he didn't think we should restart our relationship until we could really sort things out and start off on the right foot.

I am now in therapy. I realized I really needed to fix my emotional traumas and I realize now just how much our relationship was affected by my traumatic past. I talk to him about my therapy and he is supportive.

I offered to drive to see him this weekend (I haven't offered to do that before). He was happy and excited about it, even though I felt a bit awkward about staying with him at his parent's house since i'm his ex girlfriend. 

It was going to happen but last minute there was a death in the family. He calls me and I am there to support him. We are still just as close as ever..we just aren't as affectionate as we used to be even though the feelings are there. We are more reserved now. We don't call each other ""baby"" like we did every day. We don't discuss how bad we want each other sexually on a regular basis. We don't say we love each other on a regular basis although we both acknowledge that we do. We've recently talked about how we should start making the effort to see each other more often and spend some quality time together again, although this won't be easy, for obvious reasons.

 I know it seems obvious that he still loves me and wants to be with me but do you have any insight or advice? I want to be with him although I acknowledge that this is an inconvenient time period in both of our lives for a relationship. I'm glad we still talk but sometimes when I think about how things used to be, and how affectionate we were when we were together..it hurts.

r0kt8,1,2012-03-17,Recent high school grad outperforms two msft programmers,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/r0kt8/recent_high_school_grad_outperforms_two_msft/,"It was the summer of 1996.

My dad got me a job as an ""engineering intern"" at an avionics company that built computers that would be installed in airplanes (i.e., Data Flight Recorders, among other components).  Their main product was a ""data loader"", a $100k system that works as a CD-ROM drive for these computers (loads data not 640MB optical disks and then inserted into these computers).

The main problem was the proprietary programs worked on this computer, but an easy-to-use menu needed to be built for integration purposes (to have a complete product).  Two former Microsoft programmers were tasked with writing this menu program and came up with an issue.  Although these proprietary programs worked, the menu program exceeded the 640K limit for using base memory and would cause the entire system to crash.

Learning most of my skills from changing key bindings in DOS (as practical jokes), I was able to create a .BAT file that used colors in the background and could make a finished product.  Granted, it was text-based and used ANSI color schemes, the current product the MSFT programmers had looked no better.  And as my script was a .bat file, it took no memory overhead.

I felt really bad after the fact as the asshole boss fired both of the programmers for incompetence.  I went to college and found a different career.  However, I heard one of them made a lot of money from creating a key innovation in VOIP, so perhaps I won't feel too bad.

The main reason why I'm posting this story is to remind people that 640K was almost more than enough memory that was needed at one time.  I'm sure people who have been in computers longer will say 64K was adequate--or the space on a punchcard."

I also hold a Master's in Social Work and am registered with the Board of Behavioral Sciences in my state as an Associate Clinical Social Worker (i.e. I am working on my licensure hours) I have the training and the legal right to diagnose.  As does a psychologist either PsyD or PhD, a MFT (intern or licensed) or a professional counselor depending on state licensure.  You do NOT have to have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist (MD) they are the ones who can dispense meds, but they are NOT the only ones who can diagnose.  In fact, in the United States the majority of community mental health care is provided by social workers.  A psychiatrist CAN diagnose, but their word is not the end all be all of diagnoses, in fact a therapist (MSW/MFT/etc) will usually spend more time on a bio-psycho-social assessment in order to get a correct diagnosis, please please please do not discount other mental health professionals!!!

I recently acquired a dress from a Banana Republic outlet that looks similar to [this](http://site.labellush.com/saleimages/fashion_files/FWCapsuleWardrobe/work-dress.jpg), except it's dark gray in color. I think it looks professional enough to wear to an office environment (or, say, to an interview for an internship that I hope to be getting soon). But I was wondering what I should wear with it. A cardigan? Or a blazer?

Also, does anyone know where I can find shoes similar to [these](http://www.target.com/p/Women-s-Merona-Erin-Mary-Jane-Pumps-Black-Patent/-/A-13469928?reco=Rec%7Cpdp%7C13469928%7CClickCP%7Citem_page.adjacency&amp;lnk=Rec%7Cpdp%7CClickCP%7Citem_page.adjacency)? I've been looking for shoes like these (I'm terrible at heels...they always seem to slip off and I've realized the Mary Jane style is perfect for me). But they're sold out at Target. :(

I guess I had more questions than I thought. One more: what length should dress pants be, in relation to heels? Like, should they hit mid-heel, approximately?

I'm from Long Island, NY, and after hearing about UCSC it instantly became my first choice for schools. I plan on majoring in Computer Science (or doing something in the computer field, not quite sure yet), and am extremely ecstatic that I was accepted yesterday; however, my parents have done their research and approached me telling me that the school is very ""druggie"" (I'm an undercover ENT) and the quality of the CS department is less than other schools I've applied to (Stony Brook, UCLA, UCSD, and a few others).

I, from what I've heard, think that the environment at UCSC is the best suited for me, and that the experiences and education I would get there would dwarf those at nearly any other university.

Are there any undergrads with a CS major who can speak on the quality of education/the opportunities available after graduation with Silicon valley internships (that's the major selling point to my parents).

I'm majoring in Chemical Engineering with a focus in Bioengineering. I've done fairly well, but as of late my grades have slumped; I've gone through some emotional ""stresses"" and whatnot, plus my professional level classes take a lot of time.

Anyways, so my GPA is a 3.42, though after this semester I hope to raise it to a 3.55-3.6 (this is my last semester that's going to go on my med school application). I'm not sure what my science GPA is, but its taken a hit due to the previously mentioned problems as well as some douche bag professors. I'm very involved in the college of engineering; I'm a member of AIChE, as well as Theta Tau (eng. fraternity), plus I've been an officer for Tau Beta Pi (engineering honors society) for 2 years. I've done research with the Univ. of Michigan, and am now working in a highly esteemed tissue engineering lab. I have a lot of clinical experience from shadowing 5 different physicians (though I've spent most of my time shadowing an ER doctor). And finally, my MCAT is coming up in April.

So, I'm a little nervous about things; I feel like I'm not going to get in because of my GPA and my community service (I have some comm serv at a free clinic in Detroit, as well as 150 hrs with a hospital at the end of my senior year in high school going into my freshman year of college).

Right now I'm a student. I'm in my 4th year in a very difficult major at a good university, so I have to spend a lot of time studying. I'm also an intern at one of the largest corporations, and I have a job lined up after graduation. So, while future prospects look good, I'm poor as fuck right now. My parents are just as poor as me, so I can't ask for money. I'm living in a super small studio apartment and live very frugally, so I get by. 

My girlfriend is currently in school too, but she lives with her family. They're really abusive and she wants to move out, but her internship is unpaid, so she's poorer than me and can't afford to. Her family often kicks her out then forget about their argument after a week and let her move back in. During those few days, she usually crashes with me. It gets soooo cramped, but she's got nowhere else to go, so I'm fine with it.

The problem is that she eats all my food. I live off of beans, rice, eggs, and ramen noodles. I can't afford to feed us both, even if it's just one week a month. I'm perfectly ok with her staying with me, but I really need her to throw in a few bucks for food or buy her own.

How do I ask this? I don't want her to think I don't care about her or make her feel unwelcome, and she probably doesn't have a few bucks anyway.

tldr: I'm poor. My girlfriend is poor. Sometimes she stays with me. She eats all my food. I want her to pay for it. How do I ask her?"

It is too porous and risks contamination! I have began collecting stone bricks and glass to rebuild parts of the damaged SeaLab and would ask any collaborators to remember to sterilize their building materials with fire before use!  Safe materials are: Stone, Stone Brick, Brick, Glass, Obsidian, Lapis Lazuli, Iron, Gold, Diamond.

That said, the Op. could use as much sand, glass, stone, stone bricks, cobble and coal as any of our interns or allies can spare.  We are not actively rebuilding the SeaLab as priority 1, but we are interested in stabilizing the structure so that we may re-open it to the public -- even if official Op. experimentation moves to our SkyLab.

As the title says, I have been living in a medium sized city in Sweden all my life. I am 26 years old, in january 2013 I will have completed my education at my local uni.

I have about five years of work experience (retail) along with five years of studying to become a teacher in secondary school. Now the thing is I want to get away from my hometown and I have always wanted to go to the United States. As for time frame I was thinking that I'd like to be away for a year or so.

I'd like to consider myself employable. however, I realize that I can't just get a job since I am not a citizen so I was thinking along the lines of getting an internship somewhere. The job does not matter.

I could also see myself taking some classes, but I am already in debt from studying five years here in Sweden. It is not a big debt, but I have used up my student loan quota.

The reason I want to go i simple. I'd really like to visit the US to get a feel for the culture and meet the people, broaden my views. I think it would make me a better teacher in the end (Social Sciences and English).
On a more personal note, I am tired of doing the same thing day in and day out, meet the same people. My week is basically work, study, party, (occasionally) meet girls and it is killing my soul. I want to do something more stimulating. Call it my own personal journey or something crappy like that.

It might be a bit naive of me to think that going to the US is possible for me, but one can dream right?
Oh, and if there are any unmarried american female redditors looking for a blond blue eyed swede with an accent, maybe we could make an anchor viking baby :)

So what are my options?

Thank you beforehand for any advice!

I want to go to the US to work or study, what are my options? Thanks!"

2) If I get like 1g of protein per kg of bodyweight (~80kg = 176lb) but don't lift, what happens? Will I lose strength and/or muscle mass?
3) If I lift but don't get enough protein, will I at least be able to keep most of my muscles?

My problems are that I don't speak Chinese and in mainland China barely anyone speaks English (aka I'm fucked). There might be a gym in this city but I don't know what Chinese people consider a gym. I found a KFC nearby but doubt I could get whey. Eating KFC each day doesn't sound appealing but I'd prefer that over losing all my gains any day. Then again I'd probably have to eat a ton of food at KFC as that'd be my only source of protein. I don't mind gaining fat as I can cut when I come home.

I appreciate anything. 

tl;dr: Please answer my questions 1) to 3). "

I've been thinking about this for some time, but I'm not sure what to do, so i would appreciate some sort of feedback.

I really want to go to grad school for math (phd), really want to have that knowledge just for the sake of having it. The dilemma stems from the fact that even a math phd degree will most likely not get me into some sort of a decent-paying job.

My question is, would it be a bad decision to go for a phd, and THEN, years later, start up on the actuarial exams? Would it be too late, from a recruiter's point of view? I realize that the accepted way of getting into the actuary field is doing 2-3 exams in undergrad, getting an internship, and then working up from there. Would my path be too far from practical?

So I have looked over many sites about Shanghai internships, teaching opportunities and what not. I am very much interested in these teaching programs I've heard about where you teach english for a stipend/salary although I don't have a teaching degree or experience in that. So I am open to anything. However, I have also read about many scams and whatnot. So my question is basically can you guys help me out in any way? Information about work/volunteer/intern/teaching opportunities, warnings about certain types of hirings, any information from you guys that actually live there will help. btw my degree is in political science and asian studies, and I've only taken chinese 101 and 102 at my college. Thanks for reading. 

Edit: I also just wanted to add that I am Tibetan. I am an American citizen though, but still do you guys think this could cause any drama with employers?"

r1juk,2,2012-03-17,Getting that foot in the door,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/r1juk/getting_that_foot_in_the_door/,"I hope this isn't too off topic.  I'm looking for some advice.  Even an answer like ""You're asking for too much."" helps me.  I just need some perspective and advice.


First, here are a few observations I have made about my city.  

We are an ""engineering city"" with a decent amount of tech jobs.  Many of these revolve around government contracts.  In order to win these contracts, it seems that the employers are only hiring more senior levels or helpdesk with little to no juniors.  Companies here are not wanting to train anyone.  They just want someone who can walk in and do the job.  


I've had multiple companies fly me in for interviews.  I've fielded call after call from recruiters out of state, but I can't seem to get anything going in my own city.  


A little background on me.  I am currently working in a web hosting tech support position while finishing the last semester of my degree.  I have worked co-ops and internships all throughout college, and have about four years of total IT experience from these positions.  I'm kind of a generalist, which is why I had my degree focus in information security.  I'm trying to really land a good junior sysadmin position and really expand my learning.


I've been running little servers at home for years - asterisk, BSD file servers, LAMP, Active Directory, NAS boxes, and the like.  It's hard for me to learn something just to learn it, so I come up with a way I can incorporate it into my home network to make it run more like an enterprise.  This has worked with great results for the most part.  These are things that my college degree aren't going to teach me.  


Now, I'm trying to get to that next level, but I'm having trouble out of most companies.  I actually have a job offer.  It's what I want to be paid out of school, and it's significantly more than my current job and the co-ops I've worked for around $15 / hour.  The job really calls for an IT generalist, but is going to require a lot of moving around -- every two years on average.  I'm actually wondering why this company is willing to ""take a chance"" on me when I get cold shouldered by the rest.  


Here is what I don't want - I don't want another tech support position.  I can post my resume if it'll help, but I really think I have experience beyond the support desk.   Am I asking too much to want to be hired into a junior sysadmin position, considering I will be fresh out of college?  Is the formula of being hired into tech support and moving up after a few years the way I am going to have to go?  Should I just shut up and take the good offer I'm given out of state?  


I would seriously appreciate some sage advice here.  Most of the people here are on experience levels I only hope to be on one day."

Here's my current situation:

- Will be graduating college this May
- No student debts/loans to pay back
- No credit card debt
- I owe my parents money for a car they helped me purchase 2 years ago. They gave me a 36-month repayment plan and I have 11 more months to go
- My only other bills I have are monthly cell phone bills and those run me $30/month
- I commute to and from school once a week, and I drive to and from work about a few times a week, so I'm spending about $40/week in fuel costs

I make about $500 every other week and from that $500, I have $70 automatically taken out for company stock. My employer also provides me with an additional 15% of my $70, so I'm getting $80.50 in company stock every other week.

I don't have any emergency fund saved up. Due to some lengthy periods of poor spending habits and a few unpaid internships with fairly large expenses attached, I have only just now begun to get back on my feet financially.

Should I continue to purchase company stock? I work for a massive, stable company, so I have no fears that the price of stock will suddenly take a dive. I'm just wondering if what I'm doing is smart, or if I should stop and really just start saving?"

I'm doing a lot with my life and am extremely busy: school, job, internships, gym, court-required dui classes, community service, studying.

However, since my ex broke up with me about 6 months ago, I've been very lonely, and at the end of the week, although I talk to many people at the things I do, I'm having a hard time being alone in this struggle.

She was my best and only friend, so when she left, all of the friends I had connected to her also turned against me. My coworkers arent really my friends, and my classes don't meet regularly enough to get to know anyone, and, i don't know, I don't have any friends I can just call and hang out with.

I mean, when I do talk to girls here and there, my conversation skills are pretty strong, but I'm rarely in one place for long for anyone to get to know me. I don't know too many people my age, and the few people I do study with don't have a strong interest in friendship, just association. I'm getting more and more phone numbers, but all the connections I make are professional and lack spice.

I'm doing a lot in my life, and I hope I eventually do meet people soon and make new friends, but right now it's just really hard. I go home at the end of the week and realize I haven't hung out with a single person.  I don't know if this belongs on nofap, but I watched porn a few nights and it provided me a sense of escape, even though I didn't fap. I'm more and more tempted to escape in this way, and have been more tempted to touch myself.

My libido is also super high, and the fact that it isn't going anywhere is a bit depressing. I don't know what to do. Maybe just stick to my commitement until some friends wash along the shores of my wants and desires? Stay positive and hope I find some good opportunities? Am I not putting myself out there enough?

It is here I must ask you this:


Is it possible to have a successful revolution (I am not going to define how this is carried out, only that after the revolution, The Workers own the Means of Production, or some governmental system is in place to eventually achieve that goal) with out violating Human Rights via Terror etc?


Is the notion of Human Rights (freedom of speech, freedom of religion, etc..) a Capitalist ploy? By Ploy, I mean like an opiate to ease the workers pain while keeping them in bondage.


Should we abolish certain freedoms?


What is a Socialist (or Communist) Morality? Does Socialism (or Communism) have a ""ends justify the means"" morality?


Is it right to torture, summarily execute, or intern Capitalists?


Is it right to exclude Capitalists from the political process? Even in a Socialist country, where I am assuming their money will have little sway on the Workers?


What universal rights do Humans have? Do they have them all the time?


Thank you for your responses. This post doesn't have some sort of Anti-Socialist agenda, I am merely trying to find answers to my questions.

I visited the U of I campus and fell in love immediately. :/

Alternately, I have a few upcoming interviews for attorney's offices here in Florida where I live, which would again incur no major costs of living there, with no income either. However, I do not have anything locked down as of yet. 

I don't have family in Florida, so I worry that being able to display strong ties to the state may be a challenge for OCI interviews for my 2L year.

First, let me preface this by saying that I actually don't suck at my work. I was laid off this afternoon due to cash flow issues. But anyone who's looking to fill a marketing job should be pretty happy with my skill set.

* Writing: I got this in spades. I have my BA in creative writing from the University of Houston. I graduated after having successfully completed an editorial internship with the university's fundraising wing as well as with honors in major and a completed novella. Additionally, upon graduation, I worked as the temporary Development Communications writer for the university. In my most recent job, I wrote the company's press releases, blog posts, and social posts; created and maintained the company editorial calendar; and created and maintained the standards for marketing communications. 

* Community Management and Social Marketing: Again, this is something I know pretty well. I cut my teeth moderating chat rooms and forums as a teenager, then picked up even more in college when I started doing recruitment for gaming groups via mySpace (it was relevant then), Facebook, and Twitter. A couple of years ago, I started taking care of social management for Extra Life Houston, a gamers' and geeks' charity, and here in Austin, up until about 20 minutes ago, I was the social media and community manager for a small social-mobile game development company.

* SEO: For on-page optimization, you won't find anyone better. Not only do I know how to seamlessly insert keywords so that they're unnoticeable to people while being present for search engines, I'm notoriously detail oriented, meaning that I always have suggestions on ways to improve a page. I'm a big proponent of ensuring that a page's content is of high enough quality to be shared via social channels (free links, you know), and I'm always down to collaborate on something.

So, yeah, long post short, if you need someone with my skills let me know."

Ho. Lee. Fuck. Massive confidence boost right there on top of finally getting an interview. Gonna celebrate tonight with all kinds of LoL, Guild Wars, and pretty much everything I can conceivably do with my boy. ;3"

My professor sucks and nothing is changing about that. In undergraad I was incredibly pleased with both my lecturer and my book, Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences by Thorne &amp; Giesen. It was very helpful and made a lot of sense--but it only goes up through chi square. 

I am currently using Advanced &amp; Multivariate Statistical Methods by Mertler &amp; Vannatta, but since I am receiving no lecturer assistance in learning this stuff, I am having a very difficult time. Can anybody recommend some literature that would be much more reader-friendly? 

I am particularly looking for good explanations and examples regarding discriminant function, path analysis, logistic regression, and confirmatory/common factor analyses. 

Thanks, and I will put this into a few other subs like for Psychology in case this is the wrong place for it. 

I just feel completely let down. I was so proud of my understanding of statistics through undergrad, I tutored for 3 years, and breezed through Advanced Stats in grad school since it was covering everything I already did in undergrad. Now I am lost and I feel unprepared for internships doing data collection and analyses. "

A lot of these ""studies"" do not use very good statistical models to represent their study population and/or make huge unrealistic assumptions.

I have read a few more academic based studies where a bit more attention is paid to using proper statistics...but even then...it's not as good as it could be.


I am almost done my undergrad in engineering and have had 2-3 internships, and the statistics used for testing is amazing (ofc these are much more simpler beings)

But who is supporting these studies with no math/stats basis at all? they might as well not do them."
r3wil,3,2012-03-19,"About to change my major, tell me if I'm crazy.",Dancetrooper,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/r3wil/about_to_change_my_major_tell_me_if_im_crazy/,"So I've had my heart set on being a Computer Engineer since high school. The curriculum so far is great. Programming isn't exactly my strong suit, but it's a valuable skill and I'm glad to know more than the average college student.  I love the hardware aspect of my major, and I'm much better at the electrical engineering side than the computer science.

But there seems to be this problem when I try to go out and find internships or even have casual conversations with people about what I'm doing in school.  When I'm speaking with employers, a lot of them have a hard time understanding what computer engineering is. Maybe I just get the herps and derps of recruiting, but this problem has come up enough as to where I'm probably going to switch to Electrical Engineering.

When I talk to anybody, the conversation goes something like:

Me: ""I'm a sophomore in computer enginee...""

Recruiter: ""OH SO COMPUTER SCIENCE K WE WANT ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS, LATER""

Me: ""No actually, most of my curriculum is electrical engineering classes, and it really only differentiates itself from electrical engineering during the last few semesters of school.""

At that point, they kind of understand, but seem to still be confused or horrified by what I'm doing, and continue to assume that I sit in front of a computer and program all day. I'm convinced that Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science would be a significantly better choice, and it will clear up the confusion people are having with what I'd like to do upon graduation.

For the summer, I took a full-time research job at my university instead of an internship. This may or may not have been a horrible idea, but once I officially switch my major, I'll have to stay in school an extra semester or two and figure I can make up for the lost internship/co-op during that time. I didn't want to take a computer science internship, which is basically all that was available to me. I feel as though electrical engineering positions will be given to electrical engineers, and computer science positions will be given to computer scientists(and I feel like the computer science positions are much more abundant).

Anyway Reddit, this might be a rash decision, but I want people to know that I'm more interested in hardware and electrical engineering than computer science. I was hoping to get some feedback on whether or not this is a bad idea, or if other people have had the same problem."

On certain days, I'm also the only technician working. This can get ridiculous because I am responsible for check-out, drive-thru, drop-off, answering the phones, as well as production (pulling meds, counting pills, performing RTS). However, on the online tutorials for CVS pharmacy, it mentions that techs should only have 1 customer interaction job in their list of duties. That would be great if we actually had enough techs! I asked the pharmacist about hiring more techs but she told me we're already over our budget. 

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy pharmaceutical work even at the retail level. I also love the pharmacists I work for. However, for less than 11 bucks an hour, I am not willing to run around for 8 hours straight while having to try to eat a sandwich in between typing up prescriptions. The whole practice makes me believe that CVS is just setting up the perfect environment for error and I wasn't entirely surprised that the CVS in New Jersey accidentally gave out tamoxifen pills instead of fluoride pills. :( Is there anything I can do about the situation? I know AZ doesn't have any laws mandating lunch breaks but I absolutely disagree with the way the pharmacy is currently being run. 

I'm going to be an intern once school starts in August and I'm starting to think CVS might not be the best place to work for me. Anyone got suggestions for better pharmacies to work for? "

* Build gears and a crankshaft out of them and create a human powered fan out of them. When one of the interns asks me if I need help I can have them pedal my fan :)

The task: clean the office toilets, which, since the office was below deck ON the ship, meant the job was extra cramped and completely unventilated (also super gross). I did the day's work and got home and like a whimp told my parents about it. They were horrified, so I didn't show up the next day and went to work at Starbucks instead.

What i do at the internship is I take layouts of business cards and load them on to Photoshop then crop and fit them into the standard size. I am not that skilled in Photoshop though so they have me do basic things. Soon they might teach me how to set up layouts of cards.

Hello. I have been reading and learning about the Russian Revolution and other revolutions. Its seems to me that the use of Red Terror was a serious violation in Human Rights. Then I began to think about my own definition of Human Rights and Morality. If I have been raised in a Capitalist Environment, then have I grown up have those views ingrained in myself. That is, do I have a Capitalist view of Morality and Human Rights?

It is here I must ask you this:

Is it possible to have a successful revolution (I am not going to define how this is carried out, only that after the revolution, The Workers own the Means of Production, or some governmental system is in place to eventually achieve that goal) with out violating Human Rights via Terror etc?

Is the notion of Human Rights a Capitalist ploy?

What is a Socialist Morality? Does Socialism have a ""ends justify the means"" morality?

Is it right to torture, summarily execute, or intern Capitalists?

Thank you for your responses. This post doesn't have some sort of Anti-Socialist agenda, I am merely trying to find answers to my questions.

This post is also rather vague. This is on purpose. I want to get as many responses and as widely a variety as I can. Please, I want to hear from all the Socialists (Marxists, Leninists, Trotskyists.. etc... etc).

Quick Edit: What I meant, is that I want to hear from all shades of Socialism.

My CT just wrote me a good mid-term evaluation rubric--standard strengths/things to improve on. No grave concerns. Every conversation we'd had had been cordial and positive. We don't really click on a personal level, and he seems grumpy about the administration a lot, but no big deal. 

At least I thought so. The other day, I was grading papers, minding my own business, and he sat down across from me and just started berating me out of nowhere. He seemed angry that I had not yet gained complete independence, that I was not planning and teaching everything all on my own (I've been taking the lead teaching 3 of his 5 classes, doing most of my own planning but asking for his input/help). I tried calmly explaining that I was working towards a two-week solo period in April, that it was explained to me that I should gain independence gradually, etc. He interrupted me and angrily told me not to argue with him. I said I was just trying to discuss things and he said, ""I'm not gonna schmooze and discuss things with you."" He also said, ""I'm not here to teach you how to teach. I'm not getting paid for this. I have enough work to do."" That particularly made me feel like shit, because I thought he was supposed to be my mentor. I very calmly asked if he could give me specific things that I wasn't doing that he wanted me to be doing, and he said, ""Oh, now you're really getting me angry!"" It was soooo weird.

I acted in a very calm way, was apologetic for whatever shortcomings there were, etc. I didn't really have any choice but to be totally submissive. This was in the middle of the day, and I still had to teach in an hour or so. My feelings were really hurt, badly. He threatened to try to get me failed out of my program: ""The next time your college supervisor is here, it won't be pretty!"" Well, I have a good relationship with my college supervisor, so I called him right away. This incident happened on Friday, and my supervisor is coming in first thing on Monday to try and get things straightened out.

This weekend, I put a lot of time into designing lessons and just trying to feel OK about everything. My supervisor and some other people I've talked to seem to think that my CT had some other issues going on, and that he blew up at me. I'm eagerly awaiting my supervisor's visit tomorrow morning, just to try and get some sense of normalcy back. The whole thing just sucks, because I now dislike my cooperating teacher as a person and do not feel comfortable around him. But I'm over halfway through my student teaching, and I don't want to start all over. 

Does anyone have any advice for me in this situation? Should I just grin and bear it, and hope he doesn't flip out on me again? Should I try to switch to a different teacher halfway through? Should I scrap it and try again next semester? Why would this guy volunteer to be a cooperating teacher if he was going to feel like he's ""not there to teach me how to teach"" because he's ""not getting paid for this""? I mean, what the hell? 

Anyway, I feel like shit about the whole situation. I wanted my student teaching to be a good experience with a mentor who would help me and communicate with me. Not someone who flips on me out of nowhere, then says, ""I'm not discussing this!"" It feels good just to vent about it. 

UPDATE: So, after spending the weekend working hard on planning and trying (unsuccessfully) not to worry about the situation, I went back to work this morning. My college supervisor, my CT and I sat down and talked things out, and it seems like everything is going to be fine. Hopefully that incident was just an anomaly, and we can continue to work together. He was very positive and helpful today, and I no longer feel like shit. Best of all, I learned from the experience, including areas where I can improve my teaching. So. Moving on."

Should I go to Cannes?,hbomberman,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/r2vwv/i_need_advice_should_i_go_to_cannes/,"I've been offered the chance to go to the Cannes Film Festival as the intern of a film finance consultant. As her intern, I would hold preliminary meetings to see who's worth her time. She has told me that this is a great opportunity for me and that each contact she makes will also be a contact for me. I would have to leave Cannes early (I have my college graduation and a big trip that we've been planning for a while) but while I'd be missing many screenings, most if not all of my work for her would be done by then.

Also, it will cost $5,500 without airfare. That includes hotel, festival pass, and some dinners/events.

How worth it does this sound? Should I go?"
r2v8h,5,2012-03-18,I've just about fucked my entire life up ,beyondthis,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r2v8h/ive_just_about_fucked_my_entire_life_up/,"Hey all, 

Not even sure where to start. To some this might not even sound like a big deal but I'm just about ready to give up all hope. I used to be driven, aggressive, and goal oriented. I went to film school and wanted to work in the entertainment industry my entire life. I was always positive that I'd be successful, I've had some really awesome internships in the industry, lived in LA for a little bit, and was genuinely proud of myself and confident that I would succeed. 

Then I graduated college about a year ago. I thought I'd move out to LA within a matter of months and get my life started. Well things haven't gone exactly as planned...

I (stupidly) hadn't saved up a lot of money over my college career, not even a real penny to my name once I graduated. This meant I had to move back in with my parents and postpone my plans. Fortunately I live in a suburb of NYC so I thought finding a job in the entertainment industry would be easy and I would be on my fast track to LA in no time. Hit with reality hard when I realized that no one wanted to hire college graduates, that it is almost impossible to get experience, that the best I could do was getting unpaid internships. I was still positive though, managed to find a paying gig on a game show and saved up a good amount of money. Since the season of that show ended (November) I have not worked since. All the money I saved up I either spent on basic living expenses (even though I live with my parents I still need to pay my own bills and food) and student loans. I am now penniless basically again. I can't even seem to find unpaid internships in my field. I feel like a complete and utter failure for the first time in my life. The past month I just kind of accepted that my dreams are up in flames and there is no way of getting it back. This has also caused me to hate what I have become, I feel so pathetic and worthless. I have no idea what to do. My parents just tell me to get a job driving a cab or something. I have nothing against these types of jobs, I would feel like I failed at my goals if I did this. I don't feel like the same person anymore, I feel like a worthless mess of a human being and dread waking up everyday, unemployed and with no hope or prospects. 

I don't even know if this makes any sense, but I lost all motivation to do anything, what can I do to help myself out of this mess?"
r2v3h,4,2012-03-18,"Morality, Human Rights, and other questions.",JustAnotherBrick,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/r2v3h/morality_human_rights_and_other_questions/,"Hello. I have been reading and learning about the Russian Revolution and other revolutions. Its seems to me that the use of Red Terror was a serious violation in Human Rights. Then I began to think about my own definition of Human Rights and Morality. If I have been raised in a Capitalist Environment, then have I grown up have those views ingrained in myself. That is, do I have a Capitalist view of Morality and Human Rights?

It is here I must ask you this:

Is it possible to have a successful revolution (I am not going to define how this is carried out, only that after the revolution, The Workers own the Means of Production, or some governmental system is in place to eventually achieve that goal) with out violating Human Rights via Terror etc?

Is the notion of Human Rights a Capitalist ploy?

What is a Socialist Morality? Does Socialism have a ""ends justify the means"" morality?

Is it right to torture, summarily execute, or intern Capitalists?

Thank you for your responses. This post doesn't have some sort of Anti-Socialist agenda, I am merely trying to find answers to my questions.

This post is also rather vague. This is on purpose. I want to get as many responses and as widely a variety as I can. Please, I want to hear from all the Socialists (Marxists, Leninists, Trotskyists.. etc... etc).

Quick Edit: What I meant, is that I want to hear from all shades of Socialism."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What is one thing you wish you knew while you were still in school?  What is your favorite thing about working where you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429guv?context=5)|I wish I knew how to fly a plane - it would have made me that much more interested in classes.  One of my favorite things is working with numerous different type of projects. Design engineers have fun, but occasionally they are limited to the specific project they're working on. Since I only oversee projects, I can bounce from project to project if I get bored.
[What is your most memorable experience in your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429guv?context=5)|Most memorable experience is completing my first project that I served as project manager. It was a really validating point for me.
[Do you ever find the technology curve in the FAA limits your success?  As an example, the federal bureaucracy that oversee's the FAA only 2 years ago upgraded the ""approved"" browser from netscape 4.3 to IE something.  Would your position benefit from privatization?  Do you think the federal oversight limits this organization or thrives from it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c428yl7?context=5)|Federal bureaucracy has its ups and downs. The upside is that we are extremely thorough and no stone is unflipped. That's really important in our line of business due to the high volume of flyers. Privatization would lead to a quicker turnaround, yes, but it would affect the quality of our work. As it stands, we do get feedback from the powers above us sometimes that drives our work in a certain direction, but I support the federal oversight as it stands.
[I am an aspiring aerospace engineer who dreams of working for either CAE simulations or Airbus. I have a huge love for airplane cockpits and should I end up in Airbus, I'd love to do avionics engineering. What's your advice for an 18 year old kid like me who intends on studying a Ba in Aerospace engineering in less than 1 year's time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c428xy5?context=5)|First of all, that's awesome and you should keep that passion going into university. I won't bore you with the typical parenting advice such as studying, doing well to get a high GPA, etc. Instead, you should read aviation blogs and keep up on the news. It'll be impressive in interviews with Airbus if you're in the know about their updated projects. Also, try to take some flying lessons if you can afford it. It's an awesome experience and you will find studying a lot easier if it's something you can relate to in a physical sense.
[I work in the aerospace industry as a design engineer and I hope you'll be able to answer my question.  There has been a recent shift in how the FAA is performing audits by either using designated engineering representatives \(DERs\) or forcing the airlines to do the auditing themselves.  Why the shift in policy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c4292sc?context=5)|Great question. The recent change is for resourcing purposes. Our offices are regional based so each office is overseeing 5-7 states worth of companies. That means we can't spend enough time on each office without sacrificing scheduling on industry's part. The DERs are a way to privatize certain parts of the FAA's work in order to facilitate projects. We don't want to force anybody to comply, it's predominantly for the company's interest.
[, do you get to travel a lot and who is the favorite supplier, airframe, or airline to visit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c4292sc?context=5)|My traveling schedule has ups and downs. Sometimes I'll go for four months without travel and then be gone for 5 out of 8 weeks. Like this spring/summer, I have 5 trips lined up with 2 forecasted so it definitely varies. I enjoy visiting JetBlue and Southwest for the very same reasons you enjoy flying with them. They're a funny and interesting group of guys.
[What is the most rewarding part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c428zr5?context=5)|Most rewarding is that I am working in the public's interest. This sounds super cheesy, but I enjoy working with the flying public's safety at mind and knowing that the quality of my work will affect so many lives. I'm just a cog in a large organization, but I know many of my colleagues feel the same.
[The least rewarding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c428zr5?context=5)|Least rewarding is the lack of physical exposure to designs/factories. We don't get to physically work with or on the aircraft we're certifying very often so it's a lot of paperwork and that can get tiring.
[Is there anything about commercial aviation that you are aware of that scares you/needs immediate fixing \(in your opinion\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c428zr5?context=5)|No, we are really on top of any safety issue that can lead to anything more serious. We have so many ways to determine root cause and risk analysis that if anything even remotely seems like it'll be unsafe, it will be addressed immediately.
[What do you commonly find in aircraft designs that need to be added or removed that somehow get into every design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429irj?context=5)|Not sure what you mean by added/removed from designs. Like a hidden design?
[When it came to the 787, what were you or your colleagues primary concerns with this stunning and high performance airliner? Was it the carbon composite body? Was there too much carbon composite? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429irj?context=5)|Primary concerns were structural integrity and more importantly, the fly-by-wire features of the 787. There were a lot of software/electrical data to be analyzed followed by re-designs. This was probably the biggest cause for delay. Can't go into too much further detail for obvious reasons.
[Join the AIAA and Royal Aeronautical and Engineering Society. They have a presence in Australia \(you're going to RMIT?\), and I have found that they are incredibly useful tools to get into the industry. Do some volunteer work for either, and you will meet some very influential people.  In Australia there is the Australian Youth Aerospace Association. We're smaller of course, but a good start if you're an Australian aerospace student.  As far as Airbus is concerned, you're actually in a good position. Airbus is working on expanding in China, and speaking chinese is a valuable asset. Given you live there, I assume you speak either Mandarin or Cantonese?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429ft9?context=5)|Great advice. Also the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) is a great group to be a part of. Lots of aviation guidelines use SAE documents.
[You're 23 and have a masters in aerospace engineering? Where did you go to school? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429zn1?context=5)|Nah, currently working towards a master's. I went to Rutgers University.
[What are some future models that you are working on? Can you give any specs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c428wj2?context=5)|Hard to project future models because of company proprietary reasons, but some of the more interesting projects would be how the FAA oversees the commercial space flight projects.
[What should a teenager who wants to become a aerospace engineer be doing now to help for college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429dj7?context=5)|Good grades. That's how you get into college. Also do extra curricular activities to boost your application.
[I'm a senior in high school looking at going into engineering. I'm not really sure which I want to do, I have my eyes on mechatronic, mining and aerospace. Are you satisfied that you went into aerospace?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c4298vr?context=5)|Very much so. I had a heavy interest in aerospace going into university so I had that in mind, but I kept my options open during my freshman year (we select our specific engineering degree at the end of freshman year). My suggestion is to ask questions to other engineers of the interested fields and talk to professors also.
[Ever see or hear of some unexplainable ""ufo"" type shit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429ca7?context=5)|Nah bro, sorry.
[To what degree does the FAA use type certification to provide an unfair advantage to local manufacturers over foreign companies. Ie. By dragging their feet on certifying foreign produced aircraft to stop/slow them from competing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42964g?context=5)|Almost none. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the EU's version of the FAA and the FAA have a strong bilateral agreement. This means many of our policies are aligned and that makes validation of a European product extremely facilitated. We also work with the International Civil Aviation Organization to set international standards. Speaking for myself, I don't treat foreign companies any differently than domestic ones.
[Aerospace engineer here too. Was wondering from FAA pov: - which company is the worst to work with? - which current project do you think will have the most trouble to get certification - what is the worst design \(in term of safety\) you saw? - bonus: favorite airplane?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429o1e?context=5)|Ahh - can't answer any of these questions except my favorite airplane - Boeing 777. Ridiculous reliability on that thing.
[What are some of the challenges in creating reliability models and maintenance policies for aircraft that are using increased amounts of carbon-fibre composite materials in place of aluminium?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c4296mq?context=5)|The challenge is having not enough data to create accurate reliability models. Because the composite materials are new in terms of how much is used through the fuselage and the wings, we don't have a lot of service history to use. Plus, we have very few failures (as well we should), so we don't have a lot of failure studies to use for our root cause analysis data. It's tough to answer this because this is more of a flight standards question and I work in aircraft certification.
[How did you do during your undergrad?  How big of a factor was your gpa and other activities when you started looking for jobs?  Do you wish you had worked harder or taken it a bit easier during college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429emj?context=5)|GPA is a big factor and doesn't get enough attention. It's a standardization of sorts for companies when they're looking to hire. However, I also emphasize extra curricular activities a lot because that is how I met the people I did to hire me for my job. I think my college experience was well-rounded and I don't have too many regrets for my work level. In hindsight, I think everybody feels like they could have gotten better grades so there's that.
[I am studying Aerospace Engineering at University of Cincinnati, but I am starting to feel lost in it and uninspired. Do you have any advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429cmj?context=5)|Hey, that's rough and I'm sorry to hear that. I felt the same way when I was in school and I think a lot of students do. I gained a lot of perspective when I interned the summer before senior year. If you don't have an internship lined up this summer, it might be a great way for you to get back on track.
[What's your opinion on people using personal GPS receiver in flight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429ndl?context=5)|Don't do that.
[I'm a third year aerospace student and I'm terrified to graduate. If I could work anywhere, I would have to say it would be SpaceX. Are there any tips you can give me on the steps I need to take to get there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429ebb?context=5)|Oh man, that's exciting. You should look into design competitions to get your name out there. There is a competition called RASC-AL that I participated in and they have NASA engineers there to judge proposals and select a winner. If you win, the judges send the proposal to NASA for consideration and if you play your cards right and network, you can get a job down the line with NASA or SpaceX. Applying for internships straight up is also a method, but it's less personable unless your application is stunning. Lots of students are interested in working at SpaceX obviously so you need to do your best to stand out.
[Would you recommend majoring in mechanical or aerospace engineering from practical standpoint?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429lzy?context=5)|Bachelors in Mech with an Aerospace Masters.
[Fellow aerospace engineer here. Been any interesting discussions at the FAA after SpaceX made their proclamation that they want to attempt to land their booster, second stage, and capsule? Think they can actually conserve enough fuel to land a first stage and actually have a decent payload capacity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429ydp?context=5)|I was just discussing this with a SpaceX employee a week ago. That is extraordinarily ambitious and I'm exciting to see where that goes. We haven't begun discussions on that yet, but there will have to be numerous issues addressed such as landing sites, safety radius, communications with towers, etc. 
[What is your opinion on DO-254 and DO-178B?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429itr?context=5)|I'm not a electrical or avionics engineer let alone software so I can't answer this properly. I have a co-worker who would have a field day with this question. The consensus is that they're not adequate in addressing the new software features being developed. I do know they are working on revisions 178C is already out if I'm not mistaken.
[Im going into first year engineering next year. Ive pretty much been in love with aircraft since I was a kid, so becoming an aerospace engineer is what I'm going for. What kinds of jobs are out there for us and what is the job outlook in your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429ynx?context=5)|Job outlook is not good currently, but in 3-4 years, I think we'll have an upswing. There are so many stages to aircraft work such as design, engineering, manufacturing, flight stands, that there will always be lots of interesting jobs out there. Best of luck in school from a fellow aircraft lover.
[COS-related question, but less mechanical:  So does having my mobile phone turned on while flying actually interfere with anything \(besides making annoying buzzing tones on the radio\)?  There are plenty of examples that point out this is a BS policy:  airborne wifi, numerous USAF platforms that emit all kinds signals, and ...less formal,  my airline pilot friend who always flies with his phone on.  Moreover it's that much of an issue can't the airlines just shield the fuselage/antenna wires when they do a redesign of the interiors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429oh8?context=5)|Was addressed elsewhere in this thread, somebody else made a good point about interference with glidescope and localizers.
[Narita airport in Tokyo has in-ground APUs at the gates now to help reduce pollution \(or so they advertise....maybe more of an electrical cart or something\).  Anything similar in the works for the US?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429oh8?context=5)|Very possible, NextGen projects might have these in works, but I haven't done too much work on that.
[What do you think about all this biofuels stuff?  A bunch of BS or legit for jet engines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429oh8?context=5)|It's pretty legit from the presentations I've seen. Still in early stages and I like the direction it's heading.
[What's your take on the UFO phenomena? Has anyone ever brought it up with you while working on aerospace related things, perhaps on the subject of safety?  *""We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity... anything you can imagine we already know how to do.""*  More quotes from astronauts, nasa staff, air force, cia and presidents - why would they say this? Any insight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429sfx?context=5)|That's a really cool website. We haven't been exposed to any of that - it would go to the Department of Defense first.
[If you were in charge of the entire agency, where would you direct funds? What would you want to accomplish for the good of humanity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429sf5?context=5)|Oh jeez. For one thing, I would put more effort into electronic documentation instead of the massive piles of paperwork that we store. I would also have a better way of communicating policy changes to the agency. For the good of humanity, I would like more sharing and caring.
[As a freshman in AE hoping to go to grad school, do you think schools weigh grades and gre or clubs more? How much did your first year gpa reflect your graduating gpa? Thanks for the ama.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42bw1g?context=5)|Grades are more important. Clubs/extra curricular activities are the bonuses and can make you stand out. My first year GPA was about the same as my graduating but the classes get much harder so it's no surprise if your first year GPA is higher.
[Ill be attending UNC Charlotte next semester for mechanical engineering, their program is partnered with NASCAR. While I have become more interested in parts development and research since my time at Autozone, I've always been fond of the idea of working as an Aerospace engineer for say, Northrop Grumman, like my cousin, or Lockheed Martin, like one of my bosses.  My dad is a civil engineer, and his belief is that ""you can make an aerospace engineer out of a mechanical engineer, but you cant make a mechanical engineer out of an aerospace engineer."" What do you think? Do you think that this degree would give me a good shot at getting a career in this field?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42ava9?context=5)|Your dad is on the right track, but engineers can move from field to field relatively easily if it's not a crazy jump. My suggestion is the Mech E undergrad and Aerospace masters if that's what you're really into.
[Hi I'm a senior in highschool being discouraged of going in aerospace since the industry isn't there in canada and getting a job is very dificult compared to other fields of engineering. That's what they say anyway. Do you think this is true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429rv3?context=5)|Not true, lots of engine companies are up in Canada such as Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE. If that's not your particular interest, you can always work for the US. I would say follow your interests and you're young, things will change in university if you attend.
[How does the FAA acount for human error when certifying aircraft? Aren't some cockpit designs going to be more error prone than others? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429tj4?context=5)|Human factors is huge when certifying aircraft. Lots of research goes into it so it's definitely accounted for. Each company has their own unique designs which is why commercial aviation pilots are certified on an aircraft to aircraft basis.
[Hi, I'm an Aerospace Engineering college student and a co-op at Delta. We deal with the FAA every day, so I'd honestly like to know, why are so many FAA officials total douchebags?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42bccb?context=5)|No idea how to answer this one. I personally try to keep the douchebaggery to a minimum.
[What hurdles are/were overcome to make something like this possible \(if you know any about it\)?  What types of technology do you believe will impact aviation in the near future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429xf2?context=5)|Unmanned aircraft is up and coming and there is discussion about having unmanned aircraft for commercial aviation.
[What were your marks like in high school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429wog?context=5)|Not awesome, one of my high school regrets.
[I am a recent college grad with a BSAE, and i am currently working on the 787, and i have come to find out that this is the more over analyzed airplane ever. There are literally thousands and thousands of load cases that we can analyze with computers now. And i have heard that for previous airplanes \(e.g. 747, 767\) there were only 8-12 load cases involved.   How does this new era of unbelievable analysis power affect what you do, and where do you see it going in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429rw0?context=5)|It's definitely been analyzed extensively because it's such a new re-design. I hesitate to ever say anything is over analyzed in my line of work because better safe than sorry. The analysis technology we have is great, but there are too many and not enough standardized procedures. I can see a lot of root cause analysis programs getting weeded out based on type of aircraft and sometimes, good ol' logic goes a long way.
[Thanks for doing the AMA! I am just about to graduate high school and enter into the world of engineering. I have been taking technical drafting classes at my school for three years, and I really enjoy it. If you could give one piece of advice to a student just about to enter college, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42clki?context=5)|This is really simple advice and it might seem really obvious now but it'll be a lot harder once you get there: don't sacrifice sleep for work. Seriously, when you're up, be productive and have fun, but when it comes down to it, you need to sleep every night to be recharged. Obviously there are deviations, but get your rest for the most part.
[My girlfriend is currently at an internship for Sikorsky in CT until about May, and she was given an offer as an intern for the FAA for the rest of the summer. Thing is though Sikorsky offered her to stay for the summer, so now she's a bit confused as to what to do next. She likes where she works and she gets along well with her coworkers, but she was wondering what it would be like to work for the FAA in Atlantic City. Any insights?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429nha?context=5)|Congratulations to your girlfriend. Personally, I would continue with Sikorsky. There's more to learn from them and from my experiences, they're a great group. The Atlantic City FAA office does some private contracting so to be honest, they're probably pretty similar in terms of what type of work she'd be doing, just on different projects.

No but seriously, airline seats go through so many testing cycles it's ridiculous. I would suggest bringing a pillow to support your lower back.
[I'm going to major in MechE next year when I go to college and, if all goes correctly, I'll have about 56 hours worth AP credits banked up. I am majoring in MechE because it's a relatively broad field and therefore pretty practical \(and interesting\), but I really want to do something with Aerospace \(even more interesting\). Will I be able to take enough classes as an undergrad to be able to get a career in aerospace if I fill holes in my schedule with AE classes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429xg6?context=5)|Definitely. You just described what I did in college and where I am now.
[Hello I am a ME major in my second year undergrad and I was wondering what GPA did you finish your undergrad with? I ask because my GPA is sinking and I feel like it is going to be impossible to get a good internship.  Also, how did you grab your first internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42bteq?context=5)|I got my first internship by applying to a bunch of places and I actually knew a guy on the review committee so that helped me lock it in. My final GPA was 3.1 and you do have to bust your butt a lot harder in the latter years of undergrad just to keep up. Best of luck!
[Ok, safety guy, can you tell me for real why I have to turn off my phone and DS for take off?  I'm not convinced there ever has been any danger of using an electronic device - even one that broadcasts or transmits - near airplane equipment, but at least for the past 40 years or so, our understanding of electromagnetic interference renders it trivial to isolate compartments in airplanes.  Plus, lately, they're playing the safety video during taxi to the runway, and there's a coffee pot on, and god knows what else.  So, can I get a no-bullshit, grounded \(heh\) in science, non-nanny-state answer: Am I really going to crash the plane if I don't shut off my iPhone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c429vmo?context=5)|Everything in the aircraft that runs on electronics is tested to exhaustion to work on the aircraft. Your iPhone is not aircraft-certified so that's why it should be off. It's not about one person who keeps their phone/device on, it's about if enough people do it.
[Hey I'm a junior physics major and I want to go to grad school for something after I finish, but I'm not sure exactly what for. I've heard that some engineers go to graduate school and get a Masters or PHD in engineering after studying physics as undergrads, is that true? Or do you think you have to study engineering as an undergrad in order to do it in grad school? thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42av7m?context=5)|The masters in engineering will probably have some pre-requisites that you might have to fulfill first but you should be able to do it with a physics degree.

If so, what was it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42b8kl?context=5)|No not yet, but I hear they are good learning situations. There is probably a more depressing side to it because it is an accident investigation.

[My girlfriend is going to be graduating with a bachelors in Aerospace in 2 months. She's almost constantly worried about not being able to find a job despite the uniqueness and versatility of her field of study. How can she land her dream job \(space programs or environmental sustainability\) without going back to school for 2 more years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42awzn?context=5)|Don't expect to land the dream job right away. Don't be afraid to try new jobs or take on new tasks that you're not comfortable with because it'll allow her to grow and increase her experiences. Keep the goal in mind and honestly, try to create opportunities and capitalize on them.
[Hey there, I'm an aspiring Aerospace Engineer in high school. I was just wondering if what you do is as good as you dreamed it, when you decided to go into it. I feel like I have this great image of designing and producing aircraft and the like, but I also have a feeling that it may not be like that. Any advice? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42dnl1?context=5)|You're right, it's not as grand as you're envisioning, but it is similar to a lesser degree. It'll be a good time if you're interested enough.
[Okay, so you're a rocket scientist.  That don't impress me much.  So you got the brain but have you got the touch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42ls7f?context=5)|Oh I got the touch. I keep the skies safe because I'm so fly But at night I kick it back you don't need to ask why.
[How much can you bench?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42avz8?context=5)|Oh man, I'm awful at benching. I can press my body weight (155) though which I'm pretty satisfied with.
[Isn't the composite construction of the Boeing 787 sort of a risky venture?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r1y9e/iaman_aerospace_engineer_for_the_federal_aviation/c42jlaw?context=5)|Very much so, but the end result is a lighter plane that is more fuel efficient.

r5wqq,2,2012-03-20,"Likely that my girlfriend will have to move out of the country in a few years, it's ages away, but it's bothering me",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r5wqq/likely_that_my_girlfriend_will_have_to_move_out/,"I met her in high school. We were best friends for ages, after being friendzoned for a bit, we started dating for 6 months. We broke up. After ironing out the issues we had before, we got back together and have had a good few weeks together. A lot of the issues that were there before are simply gone, and we're a lot happier. Oh, and we're both 18.

I'm doing medical school, so I will need to stay here (In New Zealand) for at least 6 years, at the minimum. After doing that, I have a guaranteed job here. I COULD move but it would be very inconvenient. 

She is doing a pharmacy degree. It is very hard to find a job with that here, but in Australia, there is a huge demand.

I'm freaking out.

When we were first applying for university, she applied for Australia too. She really wanted to stay here, but if she didn't get in here, she wanted a backup. From the moment I knew this, to the moment I found out she got in here, I was freaking out. That was the worst month of my life. I obsess over things, that's my nature. It is SO helpful for studying in my degree. When I want to sit down and study and focus, I can do so for like, 36+ hours straight, but it's not helpful when a bad thing comes up. I can't think about anything else.

I knew she would probably have to move before, but I forgot it and wasn't thinking about it. She brought it up just offhandedly/casually yesterday, and i freaked out. She has 3 years of the degree, then an intern year. If she can't find a job here, she will need to move in 4-5 years, or, even worse, if she can't find an internship here, she will need to move in 3.


The big thing that was an issue in our relationship last time around was that I liked her so much more from the start. I wanted so much, and I admit, it was my fault, but I acted like everything was on a time limit. If anything small happened, like we missed once chance to hang out or something like that, it would REALLY bother me, but she would just say ""Don't worry, stop acting like we're on a time limit, we have as much time as we want"". Same with anything that happened. This time around, for the first few weeks, I kept to that. I learnt and realised not to get hung up on little things. There's no reason to get upset when we have all the time in the world to make up for it. 

Now we don't. Now we (probably) have a time limit. I know that it's years away, but it's coming. I can't deal with it. The reason it's been so good this time around is because of a) The fact that she likes me so much more this time, so it's more even, so I don't feel like it's mismatched, and b) I have calmed down and relaxed and realised that since we're not running out of time or anything, I don't have to get upset over little things.

Now that b) is gone, it's like its back to last time. How can I deal with it? She will most likely LEAVE in a few years. Anything could happen in those few years with us. I don't know what will happen. But the only definite thing, is that she will probably have to permanently relocate to a different country. We have a time limit. Help me."
r5t0k,6,2012-03-20,I've mastered being completely worthless and am about a week from being homeless because my family doesn't give a shit and I have no friends that care.,sosothrownaway,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/r5t0k/ive_mastered_being_completely_worthless_and_am/,"I am a college graduate, yet I have been either marginally employed/unemployed since I graduated over 2 years ago. At best I've worked, like now, 30-35 hours a week at minimum wage jobs in one of three different states I've lived in because of how far I send my resume out. I just this afternoon got yet another rejection email from a job that I ostensibly could have been perfectly qualified for that I drove over 400 miles round trip for the interview for. I have no phone, but have gotten calls from people at my parents number, constantly about student loans that I'm trying to defer, and credit cards I had to stop paying on because my accounts became overdrafted.

My parents went from suggesting I could house sit for them a few months ago to finding some random co worker of my mothers so now I don't even have a house to stay in, and not enough money to actually get a place to live where I work, over 2 and a half hours away. The only money I've saved from tax return and paychecks needs to cover registering a car, getting car insurance, and nearly 300 dollars worth of repairs it needs just to run. 


Meanwhile, as my parents tell me I have 3 weeks to figure something out, my mother expects me to feel something about her mother, who is in the hospital with pneumonia, at 80 plus odd years old. A woman who I haven't so much as spoken with in nearly 2 decades, since before I was 10 years old, and then only sparingly. All this on top of them not giving a shit about me at all. Odds are they couldn't even tell someone, if that person asked, what my major or minors were in college. 

The people I've been staying with are shitheads to me, treat me like I'm nothign but a burden even though I'm only there for about 4 horus a day, twice a week, just to sleep, basically. 

Even if I had the money to cover car and an apartment/house with the only friend I know in that town I'm working in, I wouldn't have a bed, or furniture, or anything else. 

The only reason I even still feign interest in my parents is because they did give me access to their 17 year old car that needs over 300 in repairs just to run, just to get to work. Though they still hold that over my head, as two retired people with two other newer cars and an RV like they're doing me some world breaking favor. 

I have absolutely no one to talk to, my friends are all living lives that have nothing to do with me. Even the friends that I've applied for jobs where they're working have done nothing to help me even get other low end serving/restaurant jobs where they are. 

At one point, I had been an intern at state government, wrote a column for my school paper for nearly two years, that won an award, and had even  received one personal correspondence from a national level. Now I'm making just enough money to cover gas, oil, eat at work...sometimes. Not enough to feed the 2 small dogs I have, who are staying at my parents while I spend all my money on gas to travel working/looking for jobs/trying to fight off the crippling loneliness/burgeoning insanity I feel creeping up from this feeling of utter worthlessness and solitude. 

I'd kill myself but I don't think suicide is the right answer, at least not yet. Plus I do love my little puppies.  I regularly debate just saying fuck it, and going absolutely 100 percent off the grid, keyser soze style. As opposed to now, where I""m apparently only 85 percent off the grid, having no phone, no money, and no one to talk to, wandering the lonely streets in solitude, wondering what the shit I'm supposed to be doing with my self.

There's nothing I hate more than self pity, and I want to work my ass off and get into a better place. Which is on some level, what I thought college was for. But I've begun to feel more akin to a recently paroled felon than a college graduate.


Perhaps the most frustrating thing is that I keep so much of my stress and other concerns bottled up, and try so hard to smile and be a good social companion on the rare chances I do get to be around friends. Yet at the same time, even doing that, my friends don't have any interest in hanging out, pretty much ever.That's one of the most frustrating things. I've become quite socially adept at meeting new people, and making casual new friends, yet I have no one to talk to. And that's really all I need. I don't need therapy, or drugs, or any other sedative/etc/really. I just really would like a little human companionship, and empathy for the human condition, but no one gives a shit. 

This may all very well sound particularly stupid, and not of the highest points of my life. But I feel like my life just gets worse each day, and I'm never sure exactly how to make it any better, and don't have any one to talk to, pretty much ever. So I thought I'd write this, even just to get it out, and then just disappear back into the lonely world of the internet and post collegiate poverty.

r5skl,7,2012-03-20,Work is sucking what little life is left in me.,lutheranian,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/r5skl/work_is_sucking_what_little_life_is_left_in_me/,"I'll start this out by saying I'm not suicidal, nor have I ever been truly suicidal.  To be honest, I have a pretty good life.  I have a job with a major energy corporation, albeit a contract position.  I got married a week and a half ago to a wonderful supportive man who adores me. We adopted a kitten a few weeks ago.  

But my fucking job.  I loathe it.  I'm basically a data entry drone.  They're gradually giving me more responsibilities, but they haven't given any hints that I'll be offered a full time (salaried) position.  I'm an incredibly efficient worker and I finish my work pretty quickly (unintentionally).  When I finish my work, I'm sent home.  I fucking hate it, because as a newlywed and someone with student loans, I CANT AFFORD TO BE SENT HOME.  But I also can't slow down my work speed, I already have tried and realized I just can't.  

I don't want to go to a job where I have to interact with people.  I want to work from home.  I have incredible potential and know that I should be doing more with my life but by not getting an internship in college I royally screwed myself and am stuck at a soul-sucking job day in and day out, where my contract could end any day.

Not to mention I have had migraines the past couple months, and have missed more work than I should.  I got a talking to by my boss last week about it.  But yesterday she decided to come in hacking up a lung and now I'm feeling feverish.  It's just a shit ball rolling down shit hill and I just want to be out.

I'm sure most of us know what the job market is like right now; it's nearly impossible to find a job with limited experience.  This is my first professional job and I've only been there 3 1/2 months but I want something new.  

I don't know where I'm going with this... I just want a new job.  I want to work from home.

TL;DR: I'm too efficient at my job. I've been sick quite a bit recently and my boss just got me sick again, but I can't afford to miss work.  I want a more rewarding job, or to work from home, but the job market sucks.  My life is going well but I just feel like this job is sucking the life out of me."

I want to intern for a company. That company cannot pay me, although the prospects of payment further down the road are definitely possible. So the only option is an unpaid internship and thus I would be receiving college credit. Problem is, that due to budget cuts at my community college, I only have 3 units this semester and to quality for internships in the summer, I needed to have 6.

Obviously keeping this company out of trouble and negating liability is very important to me but I would really like to intern for them. Is there any other way to do this/loopholes I have not considered.

r5mye,5,2012-03-20,Bridging the Digital Divide,SeanONA,digitaljournalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitaljournalism/comments/r5mye/bridging_the_digital_divide/,"# Bridging the Digital Divide

While most of us live and die by the ""Digital First"" buzz phrase, most local newsrooms do not understand why they should embrace digital. If they are still making money off print advertising -- even though less than before -- what's the impetus for going digital? (A former publisher told me he feared my success with our digital product was cannibalizing our paper product. Sigh.)  



Simultaneously, my former interns and recent grads often ask me for guidance and direction about the general tenets of good reporting. Are we launching them from the nest before they are ready to fly?  



I propose a session that matches and marries best practices from both traditional and digital camps for newsrooms. Offer a panel of six; three from each side. Define the session in a five-minute opening address from a moderator, but focus on questions and topics solicited earlier through email, blog posts, tweets, etc. Pick a common topic -- dysfunctional courts,  police reporting, foreign stories, for example -- and approach it from both sides of the divide. Show the real nuts-and-bolts practices and benefits of each and how they interweave. Make the session interactive and livestream it. 



On the traditional media side, I'd pick veterans like Christopher Dickey and John Temple, who have embraced digital. On the digital side, I'm sure you have a long list of talented ""new"" journalists. I'd suggest a police reporter from the Lowell Sun (Robert Mills) who has been using new practices and social media for some time on a very tight budget. 



Why do this? To invite a wider demographic into the ONA membership family, for one. Also, to reach out to traditional journalists who are struggling with new technologies. To help newer journalists see what they can do with their new shiny technologies. Finally, to put strong, basic reporting back on the front burner where it belongs. 



Thanks for listening!

",DEEFORT,HomeworkHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/r5mri/help_needed_brainstorming_ideas_for_persuasive/,"&gt;I am an outside consultant with a large manufacturing company.  I have a four month contract to assess the quality of the research being done by a group of eight engineers.  I have met them, as well as their five interns.  The interns are PhD students from a local university.  They help with various projects, are not paid, but do receive credit for their work.

&gt;One of the engineers is writing papers that are based primarily on data that were generated and analyzed by an intern.  She is not crediting the intern; she is only putting her own name on the work that is based on this student's research and analysis.

&gt;The quality of this research is good--and research quality is exactly what the company hired me to access.  The quality of the other engineers' work is also very good.

&gt;However, the way this one woman is getting and publishing her data makes me uncomfortable.  If i expose her, this group may be unhappy with me, and that could lose me further consulting work with this company.  But if I stay quiet, I could be tacitly supporting unethical behavior.  What should I do and why?


This is a 4 paragraph persuasive essay I have to write for my business communication class.  There's clearly side A (snitch) and side B (keep quiet).  Side A has many more pros than side B.  Most students WILL be choosing side A as their position because it's much easier to do so.  I'm looking to go with side B.  I have already established the possibility that this is a large firm.



TLDR;  There really isn't a tldr, but I need as much ideas as possible.

*Side A:  Expose the engineer for not giving credit.


*Side B:  Keep quiet

Help me list pros, cons, possible outcomes for side A and side B.  **I'm mostly looking for more pros for side B.  I'm trying to take my position with side B.**"

So this is where I'm hoping you guys will be able to help. I'm about 6'2"", ~250 lbs. I love the look of the Harley Sportster line, but with the aforementioned budget I probably won't be able to get something name brand. So if everything goes to plan, I get more experience riding, take a rider safety course and have around $5000 to spend on a bike, what should I look at?"

So last night... I've been piled up with school work, two exams to study for Wednesday, work at this internship today, run an errand with a co-worker to buy his moped, and I decided to smoke it up a bit last night with a buddy of mine. You know which smoke I'm talking about right?

So, we smoke together, let the feeling kick in, and we ate at AppleBees. I'm having the most relaxing time of my life but I have to be careful because I live with my mom &amp; dad meanwhile I'm in community college.

I go home and go straight to my room to shower up, dump my clothes in the laundry, and hop into bed only to KO within 10 min.

In the morning... My mom asks why I didn't check up with her and I said, ""Because I thought you were sleeping.""

Mom: ""Always check up on me if you come home late. I had a bad dream of you coming home all drunk wearing a suit. It was a nightmare.""

Me: ""You're crazy mom.""

MeInside: *GUILTKICKSINOVER9000* ""HOW DOES SHE DO THAT?!""

TL;DR: Got high, quickly went to my room, mom dreams of me getting drunk...

Does she have a third eye or something?

Needless to say, this is an extremely important first step in my career and I want the job badly.

I landed the interview through an organization called INROADS, who helped refine my resume, gave me some practical tips on interviewing, and put me in contact with some of the managers of Hamilton. In addition, INROADS also helped an older member of my fraternity that I'm friends with land an internship at the same company a few years ago, and he's now graduating and being offered a full-time position!

I have a few concerns. While I have a great GPA (3.7), and great leadership skills (Eagle Scout, Student Lead at previous job, etc), I really lack engineering experience. I haven't gotten to the design/lab oriented courses in my curriculum quite yet, and while I have tried to become involved in things on campus (Formula SAE for 1yr, research assistant for environmental engineering prof), I really haven't DONE much of anything yet. The most difficult question for me to answer is ""what was your most difficult engineering challenge and how did you deal with it?"". I'm a very quick learner, and know that I could be an asset to this company in the future.

I know the company isn't expecting loads of experience as a young intern, but how do I focus attention on my leadership ability and strong academic performance and not on my lack of experience?

I would like to move somewhere to Western or Central continental Europe (who doesn't?), though honestly I don't care if it's Australia instead. I hear good things about the netherlands.

I've spent 6 years of my life in Germany (I was a bosnian war refugee) before coming to the US. I have relatives (not immediate family, but plenty of blood-relatives) in Germany, Bosnia, and Croatia. I used to be fluent in german, but I still have intermediate language skills and could pick it up very quickly if I were to try learning again. I frequently travel abroad and I've spoken to many friends, strangers, and relatives in many countries. Netherlands is one of my top picks, as is Austria, Germany. I love Croatia, I know the language fluently, but I fear there are few job prospects.

**tl;dr: my questions start below**

Anyway, seeing as I want to do this, I figure I need to find work or internships abroad, or build my resume here. I've seen AIESEC and I'm wondering if they'd have opportunities for someone like me, seeking an eventual permanent move, who is graduating at the end of the year? 

I've also heard that there are a lot of countries desparate for similar technical jobs. I apologize, because I'm sure this has been asked before, but where do I start? I don't know where to start *looking* for work for someone like me. What are some good sites or organizations that can help me? My end-goal is a permanent move or EU citizenship, but I know this takes a long time. Help me figure out the fastest way to reach it.


Thank you for reading this.

Now, my current job and past internship deal with general IT support in an office setting. I have limited web design experience professionally, but I've taken several courses in the subject and logged hundreds of hours in the languages the potential company uses.

r512s,7,2012-03-20,I am the master of bad timing.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/r512s/i_am_the_master_of_bad_timing/,"I'm a 24 year old male, and she's 20.

I started dating my ex about a year and a half ago. When we first started dating, there were issues. I we both had issues with exes, though mine were much more predominant than hers. I was afraid of falling in love again after the first girl I truly fell for absolutely destroyed me. She fell head over heels in love with me.

So after a year, I broke up with my ex (I'm going to call her B from now on) because I was having doubts. She mentioned moving in and I didn't know what to think. We soon got back together a week later.

Things were fine up until February where I broke up with her again. I hadn't fallen in love with her and it scared me. I thought I could do better, I didn't want to hurt her, or because the sky was blue, I don't know why I did it. 

And just like last time, we drifted back together. Except this is where things get bad for me. I realized that she meant so much more to me than I was allowing myself to believe. I was afraid of getting hurt, but after a month, I came to realize that I had fallen in love with her. It was wonderful, I had finally found what I had been looking for. She kept telling me I was the perfect guy, but during this time she was trying to move away from me emotionally, and didn't show it. She didn't know I was growing more attached. Then, She then tried to sleep with my friend who didn't know what was going on between us so I have no right to be upset with him. 

So in the span of two days, I realized that I had finally fallen for a girl years after I was emotionally crippled by my old ex, only to have the girl I had fallen for tell me she tried sleeping with my friend but he was too nervous to go through with it but she wanted it regardless. 

This was last week. Since then, I've been such a mess. I want to be angry, but after speaking with my friend, he really had no idea that anything was happening between us, and I believe him. B and I were supposed to let the other know if we wanted to see other people to give us a chance to start distancing ourselves. 

So now, she wants to see other people and I want nothing but for her to come back. I suggested we try for one month. To see if she can't feel something for me again. No dice. The past two nights I spilled my heart to her and she kept saying she was sorry, and crying but just couldn't shake the feeling she didn't want a relationship right now and she wants to see other guys. 

I'm usually a very angry person when things don't go my way... but now, I just feel empty. I'm just existing and nothing more. I don't know what to do. How to react to all of this. Not that I'll get any answer here that I haven't already heard or thought of myself, I just wanted to type this out. Feel free to comment if you wish.

**Edit**: Just adding a little bit more information and TL;DR

I am seeing a therapist and a psychologist but I hate both. The therapist doesn't tell me anything that I don't already know. Doesn't give any helpful advice, and I'm seriously considering not going to her anymore. As for my Psychologist, all he wants to make sure is that I don't go into recreational drugs and hardly knows me. I hate anti-depressant medication and I don't think I'll ever take it again.

This past week I could barely eat anything more than a quarter of a bowl of cereal. I feel sick all the time. I don't want to speak to anyone but I have a full-time job. (luckily I'm an intern and I get left alone for the most part.) I just want to forget everything. I want to stop thinking. 

I'm addicted to relationships. Everything else in my life is great. Health, a good job (I get paid a fair bit for this internship), I'm in school, I have friends, and yeah. There isn't much I can really improve other than finding a worthwhile relationship. I don't know how to be happily single. Right now, I'm so conflicted. I know I shouldn't want B, but I do. I can't see myself going after another girl. I hate the girls I meet. They're bitchy, conceded, fat, ignorant, cruel, immature, just so many attributes that make me sick. It's so hard for me to find someone I'm attracted to. 

**TL;DR - Had an amazing girl for a year and a half but didn't realize it. When I finally realized that I was in love with her, she's moved on and tried sleeping with my friend.**"

My exact approach will change based on your company’s business model/target audience/website goals.  By the end you will definitely get:

* A report (powerpoint or .pdf) with main strengths/weaknesses
* Design/Information architecture recommendations based on evaluation

Evaluation may include data from user testing (and recordings of sessions) depending on your target audience.

**What I need from you:**
If you are interested, please comment or pm me with:

* The URL of your website
* A brief summary of what your company does, what the website is trying to accomplish, and target audience

After I give you a report, I would like to know what recommendations you applied to new designs, and permission to use before/after pictures in my portfolio.  If your site is amazing and I have nothing extra to suggest, this will not be necessary.  I will provide evaluations on a first come first serve basis for sites that I feel may benefit the most.

This is why I want to become a consular officer, to learn more about the world and simultaneously better myself.  I have made a point to always expose myself to diverse backgrounds.  I abhor homogeny and believe that America's strength lies in its multiculturalism.  When I lived in Ireland I joined a musical society and worked with other Irish people in order to produce a musical.  I did this to immerse myself in their culture.  I am currently dating a Latin woman and I went to high school at a predominantly African-American school.  I have planned my own trips and activities abroad; I have even done so for friends.  I majored in Western European History, but my studies did not end there!  I have travelled and experienced other cultures on my own.  Operating and surviving on my own was a thrill and a challenge.  And I would use this knowledge and curiosity to immerse myself in foreign cultures to help other Americans remain safe abroad and at home, while at the same time helping them learn and grow from their experiences in foreign cultures.   My resourcefulness and curiosity makes me an ideal consular officer candidate.   

2. Intellectual Skills:  In the Foreign Service you will confront challenging situations that require identifying the problem, collecting relevant information, and formulating or advancing innovative solutions to resolve the problem. Describe a time when you responded innovatively to unanticipated circumstances to solve a problem. (What was the situation? What steps did you take to think through the situation? How did your action address the situation? What were the results?)

Work at Quatrefoil, being able to teach myself programming and adapt to the situation in able to effectively complete what was required of me.  I was given an internship at a company based on my strong computer skills.  However, I had never tried programming before.  The company needed to create a shell user interface for a crane simulator.  I sat down and basically taught myself how to code.  Instead of constantly questioning my boss for solutions, I found them on my own by consulting guides, asking my co-workers, and using online resources.  I was able to complete the program in the time required.  This is not the only project that I completed at Quatrefoil, I also set up and programmed a light display which required learning how to wire motion sensors and other circuits, and I also created an interface to calculate body mass index for the National Healthy Museum.  My work can be seen to this day on display at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey and Discovery Place in North Carolina.      

At Vocus, I proposed several solutions in order to help media research on various countries.  I have constantly received more responsibilities from my manager; she has often approached me for help finding difficult contacts or determining the viability of outlets.  I also have proposed and been able to implement many innovative changes, such as using Google translate to search in local languages for relevant information or using a program to develop macro scripts for the research application.  Moreover, when a French contractor was unable to finish research on Germany for Vocus, I volunteered because of my German language skills.  I gave cultural information to the rest of the team and even tips to deciphering the German language.  Our research team finished processing Germany at a much faster rate than the French contractor and helped to convince upper management to continue our project and even fund it further.  I have even been offered a job to help refine and manage the data.  

During my senior year in college I had no time to continue studying German.  I had deeply enjoyed learning a new language and unlike my previous attempts in High School, a decent amount of it stuck.  I decided instead to continue learning on my own.  I taught myself through a course named Assimil.  Unfortunately the next course was written in French, instead of ending my study there I translated the entire course into English for my own personal use.  With the knowledge I gained from both translating and the actual course itself I am now able to read novels in German; during my studies in college I could barely figure out word endings and declensions.  Now, I continue to study on my own by saving almost every word I do not know to a flashcard program on my computer.  My regular regiment of both native content and active vocabulary learning has led me to further consider a career with the State Department and now I feel confident enough to one day possibly be stationed in Germany or pursue a Master’s degree.  
  
3. Interpersonal Skills: In the Foreign Service, you will be called upon to interact effectively and diplomatically with people in difficult situations. Describe how you have used your interpersonal skills in a specific situation to resolve a problem or achieve a goal. (What was the goal or problem? What specific steps did you take? What was the result?) 

During my time at the Maryland English Institute I was given the task to help tutor a student named Mazen.  Mazen was from Saudi Arabia and was having trouble adapting to the situation.  The goal was to get him to follow instructions and complete his homework, and hopefully help him on his way to understanding more English.  I spent the better part of a week attempting to frame things in a way that Mazen would understand, including framing exercises in a way relevant to him: this included asking him to write about the Saudi King and attractions in Mecca, Riyadh and so forth when he refused to complete a rubric about a favorite sport player or celebrity.  Mazen was more responsive to my tutoring than the teacher and I believe he received some value out of my tutoring.  Unfortunately, he was not able to complete the course.  I actually don’t know what happened to him, fuck.  
	

While at the University of Maryland I was assaulted while attempting to reclaim my property.  My girlfriend’s roommate had allowed an extremely intoxicated man to enter into their apartment.  The man stole my property.  We called the resident assistant when we found him hardly conscious in the hallway of my girlfriend’s apartment.  When I convinced the man to return my property he had sudden second thoughts and charged at my girlfriend.  I was able to restrain him with minimal physical harm, despite injuries to me, and walking away peacefully.  The Residential Association attempted to charge me with instigating a fight, however I was able to represent my case clearly before a board of peers and the charges were dropped.  

In Spring 2011 my friend and I decided to go to Mexico during our spring break.  When we arrived the hotel was completely inadequate; it was dirty, and it did not have the amenities that were described.  I called our travel agency, all while calming my friend who was distraught because she had lost her phone, and explained the situation.  I told them that the hotel did not match the advertisement and explained to them detail by detail what was lacking.  I was insistent yet calm and eventually we were given a new hotel and an apology from a manager.  A similar event required me to coordinate with the better Business Bureau in order to correct fraudulent charges a company made on my debit card.  In both situations I remained patient and presented my case, while availing myself of such resources as the Better Business Bureau.     

During my time at University College Dublin I planned and led several trips on my own.  This included planning a trip with my roommate to London and leading him around the city.  I also planned friends’ trips logistically, showing them how to book hostels and rail tickets.  While in Paris, I helped guide my friends around using the public transportation.  To plan the trip I purchased airplane tickets, found a hotel, and researched what to visit and how to get there.  Towards the end of the semester I planned a nine day trip around Central and Southern Europe, through Munich, Budapest and Rome.  I made all the reservations myself and planned trips, excursions, and even nights out.  All these trips were an astounding success and we managed to do all of them relatively cheaply, finding budget airfare and hostels.  When plans went awry I took control of the situation; and communicated my way back to the airport after we missed our train stop.  

When I visited Budapest in the winter of 2009 we almost missed our non-refundable flight to Rome.  Our train tumbling through the darkened outskirts of Budapest, my travel mate and I were finally resting our feet after a long day of roaming the city.  I was sure that they would announce each station over the intercom; unfortunately they did not.  Our train ended up going forty-five minutes in the wrong direction.  I approached the conductor calm, but urgently showing him our ticket.  He seemed to understand that we had missed the airport but he did not offer any other options, instead of frantically running around I calmly paid the difference in fair and began to question those around us in the little Hungarian I knew: Do you speak English?  Luckily, the man in front of us did.  He helped direct is to a taxi cab and while we were waiting I explained to him where we were headed and how much time we had.  My outgoing nature and my ability to remain diplomatic and explain the complicated situation saved us in the end and we arrived at Terminal 2 five minutes before the check in counter closed.   

4. Communication Skills: Communication skills are critical to successful diplomacy. Describe a situation in which you used your communication skills (either in English or another language) to further an aim or achieve a goal. (What was the situation? What steps did you take to deal with the situation? What was the result?)
	 
At the Maryland English Institute I helped adult foreign nationals understand basic English vocabulary and grammar.  These students’ first languages were a colorful collection; many spoke Arabic, some Spanish, and even Japanese and Korean.  I used my communication skills to help them learn topics like the “past perfect tense” and tutored one student who was having trouble.  Instead of trying to frame topics in foreign terms I gave this student things to write about which were relevant to him: such as the King of Saudi Arabia, local musicians, and cities in Saudi Arabia.  In vocabulary class I used a flash card game to tutor a group of Saudis.  I also helped lead group work in class.  In doing so, I framed the project’s goals and expressed complicated geo-political concepts concerning the European Union in simple terms.  The groups were very cooperative and many of the students that I tutored enjoyed their time with me and at the Maryland English Institute.  I occasionally ran into former students around campus and they would always great me with a smile and a handshake.  

5.  Management Skills: Foreign Service Officers are often required to manage projects, demonstrating the ability to plan and organize, set priorities, employ a systematic approach, and allocate time and resources efficiently. Describe a project you managed or helped to manage and how you sought to achieve the project’s goals. (What was the project? What steps did you take to manage the project? What was the result?)

During 2006 and 2007 I worked at Quatrefoil Associates, a museum design company.  The company needed to create a shell user interface for a crane simulator; in order to finish this I taught myself from scratch how to code.  My manager gave me direct control over the entire process, from the use of hardware to the designing of the program.  This required coordinating with the company's graphics designers on both form and functionality.  The expectations of the project were fairly strict so I had to define and order graphics with specifications in mind.  I also had to determine what was realistic concerning animations (like a load screen) and a splash (intro) screen.  I also coordinated with other on-staff technicians in order to integrate joystick control: I found the appropriate software and coded it into the interface.  My work can be seen today at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey.  My entire work at Quatrefoil is an example of taking initiative and being able to correctly manage complext projects while matching deadlines and being able to coordinate several different aspects into one whole.  

(This might get left out)The crane simulator was not my sole project at Quatrefoil; I also set up and programmed a lights display which required learning how to wire motion sensors and other circuits, and I also created an interface to calculate body mass index for the National Healthy Museum.  My work can be seen to this day on display at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey and Discovery Place in North Carolina.  

6. Leadership Skills: Leadership can be defined as motivating others, encouraging creative solutions, establishing positive team relationships, or significantly influencing the direction of the work. Describe how you have demonstrated leadership, either on one particular occasion or over time. (What was the situation? What steps did you take to show leadership? What was the result?)

At Vocus, I proposed several solutions in order to help media research on various countries.  I have constantly received more responsibilities from my manager; she has often approached me for help finding difficult contacts or determining the viability of outlets.  I also have proposed and been able to implement many innovative changes, such as using Google translate to search in local languages for relevant information or using a program to develop macro scripts for the research application.  Moreover, when a French contractor was unable to finish research on Germany for Vocus, I volunteered because of my German language skills.  I gave cultural information to the rest of the team and even tips to deciphering the German language.  Our research team finished processing Germany at a much faster rate than the French contractor and helped to convince upper management to continue our project and even fund it further.  I have even been offered a job to help refine and manage the data.

r4eg3,1,2012-03-19,Day One,No_Touching_Willie,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/r4eg3/day_one/,"Hello nofap redditors. I'm rather glad I ran across this sub today. Here's my story.

I began my addiction to pornography when I was 12 and discovered Google image search. I soon discovered fapping, (all without any sex ed or parental sex talks unfortunately) and I've been addicted ever since. I'm now 19. I'm a born again Christian and have always struggled with the fact that masturbating goes against my morals, but I've never quite been able to completely, well, beat it! My longest nofap streak I've hit was two weeks, which happened after I had a completely awe-inspiring religious experience, and during those two weeks I felt wonderful! Not a single urge to fap. And then I just caved, without any real temptation. I think I almost wanted to congratulate myself, or see what it would feel like after two weeks, just one of those stupid rationalizations. Since that streak failed I stopped fighting the urge and just acquiesced to my addiction again.

Now I've met this girl who I've been talking to for almost 6 months, who is a great Christian girl,and I'm applying for internships, and I'm dissatisfied with the distancing that my pornography addiction causes in my relationship with God.

So here I am. I won't say that now I'm finally in it for the long haul, or today will be the time I'll finally beat it, because those statements rarely come true, and then it's all the more frustrating when failure hits. But I'm stepping back into the ring, and that's a start!

Thank you for providing me with the community I need start my battle again!

I am currently using Advanced &amp; Multivariate Statistical Methods by Mertler &amp; Vannatta, but since I am receiving no lecturer assistance in learning this stuff, I am having a very difficult time. Can anybody recommend some literature that would be much more reader-friendly?

Thanks, and I will put this into a few other subs like for Psychology in case this is the wrong place for it. 

I just feel completely let down.

I've toyed with this idea for quite a while but never really investigated my options for this career path until now. The problem is, to qualify for a postgraduate art conservation program I need some studio courses and several courses in art history. Unfortunately, the rigorous engineering course calendar has not provided me with enough flexibility to fit these prerequisites in. Perhaps I should apply for an undergrad program for a BA or BFA. I'm wondering if a BA or BFA program will be cost/time-effective because I don't necessarily need a second Bachelor degree. I guess I should also seek some sort of internship or apprenticeship in the field, but I don't even know where to start looking for one.

I'm a bit unsure of how to proceed so I'm hoping someone in the field could offer me a little bit of guidance or advice.

I posted a while back before having an interview with Google. It didn't go very well because my weakest area is programming. I understand this is the core of software engineering. I've done a bit of stuff on TopCoder and have continued working on my projects when I have time. TopCoder, however, seems a bit silly unless you're trying to practice algorithms. (Why not instead work on a project?) I'm currently trying to update an HTTP 1.0 proxy in C to 1.1 and add caching. (This was originally a project from last semester.) I am also working on small components of a distributed file system using RPC in C++ for a distributed systems class this semester. But that's just an assignment. I also have some Java experience, and know/can leverage most of the simple/intermediate language features, but haven't done anything of scale. 

I've had a couple of phone screens for software engineering positions that seemed to go well enough, but were for positions that I didn't directly apply for, so didn't really line up with my strengths. I have also received a number of no's just from my resume. Really what it comes down to is that my weakest point in terms of experience and expertise is programming as far as software engineering is concerned. On the other side of things, I've applied to a couple of IT positions. I was a manager at a university helpdesk, can do some scripting, and know some linux (not a lot, but enough to be useful). But in IT I don't have the experience in networking, database administration, ad, etc.

I'm still applying to places and have one interview coming up that lines up pretty well and seems like it might go well. But I feel like I am applying for the wrong positions entirely. I really like problem solving and feel I have a strong grasp on all of the undergraduate courses I've taken, but since many are missing from the department, I haven't taken a good OS, networking, or compilers class.

I like to think of myself as smart (I get good grades, etc.), but that doesn't seem to be very helpful at the moment. I also feel that whenever I am presented with a problem, I am pretty good at finding a good solution, given a little time to myself. I would have applied to graduate school were it not for student loans, but my plan is to pay off loans before going back. And when I do apply I think I'll go for EE, because I am much more interested in working with the technical details of things than high level abstractions.

I am wondering if anyone has suggestions in terms of what I really should work on in order to improve my chances for software engineering-ish jobs. I know that if I want to do IT, I should take courses and the like. Perhaps it's foolish for me now to be working on something in C because it takes such a long time to get everything correct and do all of the testing without making your own suitable abstractions (considering I have limited time)? Any suggestions for places to which to apply? Suggestions in terms of career path?

I appreciate any direction that I can get. Thanks.

I don't fear death, and would kill myself in an instant, but I know my parents and sister would suffer if I do. So I'm tortured, suffering for my failures, without any way out. I know that if my sympathy for my family dies, so will I.**

I'll give my story here so that, if anyone reads this, they can understand where I'm coming from. But if you want to see the main problem, skip down to ""Current Situation""

**Background:**

I'm 20 years old and in college. The only thing that was pushing me forward in life was my ambitions to do something great for the world. The traditional idea of having a stable income, getting married, having kids, owning a house, retiring, etc. just doesn't appeal to me in any way. I need to make some impact on the world.

I knew that I could accomplish this either through music, politics, or science, since I'm pretty good at music, I'm good at speeches and understanding the intricacies of the law, and I love learning about anything in science. Since science can directly save lives, I decided in high school to pursue bioengineering.

But I was lazy in high school. I got rejected from every college that I wanted to get into. In the first year of college, I considered abandoning everything and becoming some sort of religious monk, so on the side, I studied every religion I could find. Each one I studied had some logical deficiency, so I abandoned this pursuit.

By that time, I was in sophomore year in college. I was still sad about getting rejected from the colleges I wanted, and I started performing poorly. My grades fell into the B and C range.

The summer of 2011, I decided that I should try to bring my grades up if I was to have a chance of getting into grad school, which would allow me to pursue my research and try to invent or discover something that would save lives. So I tried hard in the first semester of Junior year to do well. 

I didn't. My grades and GPA remains low.

From last December, I was pretty depressed. I contemplated suicide. But I decided that I still had time to fix myself up, and I should try my hardest one more time, and should try to bring myself out of this rut.

So, since the beginning of 2012, I have been pushing myself really hard. I exercised daily, I studied as hard as I could, and I tried to work harder in research so that I can get something published this year, which would help me get into a good grad program. I also applied to several summer internships, which would both give me experience and help me with my grad school applications.

**Current Situation:**

My attempt since the start of 2012 fell apart in the last week. Because of my past grades, I got rejected from every single summer program that I applied to. Since I'm competing against the same people for grad school, the fact that I can't even get a summer internship now means that my chances at grad school are extremely slim.

I got the result from the first round of midterms, and despite studying the hardest I have ever studied in my life, my grades remained either average or below average. I have absolutely no idea what I could have done differently in studying - so this leads me to the conclusion that I really just am not as smart as I thought I was. Instead of being an outstanding individual who will be able to make an impact, I'm just mediocre. And I hate that.

My research is also failing. Despite working on a really basic experiment for a year, nothing seems to be working in it. I have invested too much time into it to leave it, but it is taking away the time that I could use to try something else. The end result is that I probably can't use my research to help me get into grad school.

So here I am. All I had going for me was my ambitions. There's nothing else that I care about in life. Even if I tried to accept mediocrity, it's too late for that. I literally have no friends. I have never had a girlfriend. I don't know how to interact with people outside of a purely academic or professional way. So I can't just switch over to being an average person - all I am capable of is having these ambitions to become great.

My applications to grad school are doomed. I don't have anything to show for my years at college. My grades are worse than they were in high school.

Now I know they are out of my reach due to my stupidity and laziness. Each day is a reminder of my failures. I don't fear death, and would kill myself in an instant, but I know my parents and sister would suffer if I do. So I'm tortured, suffering for my failures, without any way out. I know that if my sympathy for my family dies, so will I.**

I'll give my story here so that, if anyone reads this, they can understand where I'm coming from. But if you want to see the main problem, skip down to ""Current Situation""

**Background:**

I'm 20 years old and in college. The only thing that was pushing me forward in life was my ambitions to do something great for the world. The traditional idea of having a stable income, getting married, having kids, owning a house, retiring, etc. just doesn't appeal to me in any way. I need to make some impact on the world.

I knew that I could accomplish this either through music, politics, or science, since I'm pretty good at music, I'm good at speeches and understanding the intricacies of the law, and I love learning about anything in science. Since science can directly save lives, I decided in high school to pursue bioengineering.

But I was lazy in high school. I got rejected from every college that I wanted to get into. In the first year of college, I considered abandoning everything and becoming some sort of religious monk, so on the side, I studied every religion I could find. Each one I studied had some logical deficiency, so I abandoned this pursuit.

By that time, I was in sophomore year in college. I was still sad about getting rejected from the colleges I wanted, and I started performing poorly. My grades fell into the B and C range.

The summer of 2011, I decided that I should try to bring my grades up if I was to have a chance of getting into grad school, which would allow me to pursue my research and try to invent or discover something that would save lives. So I tried hard in the first semester of Junior year to do well. 

I didn't. My grades and GPA remains low.

From last December, I was pretty depressed. I contemplated suicide. But I decided that I still had time to fix myself up, and I should try my hardest one more time, and should try to bring myself out of this rut.

So, since the beginning of 2012, I have been pushing myself really hard. I exercised daily, I studied as hard as I could, and I tried to work harder in research so that I can get something published this year, which would help me get into a good grad program. I also applied to several summer internships, which would both give me experience and help me with my grad school applications.

**Current Situation:**

My attempt since the start of 2012 fell apart in the last week. Because of my past grades, I got rejected from every single summer program that I applied to. Since I'm competing against the same people for grad school, the fact that I can't even get a summer internship now means that my chances at grad school are extremely slim.

I got the result from the first round of midterms, and despite studying the hardest I have ever studied in my life, my grades remained either average or below average. I have absolutely no idea what I could have done differently in studying - so this leads me to the conclusion that I really just am not as smart as I thought I was. Instead of being an outstanding individual who will be able to make an impact, I'm just mediocre. And I hate that.

My research is also failing. Despite working on a really basic experiment for a year, nothing seems to be working in it. I have invested too much time into it to leave it, but it is taking away the time that I could use to try something else. The end result is that I probably can't use my research to help me get into grad school.

So here I am. All I had going for me was my ambitions. There's nothing else that I care about in life. Even if I tried to accept mediocrity, it's too late for that. I literally have no friends. I have never had a girlfriend. I don't know how to interact with people outside of a purely academic or professional way. So I can't just switch over to being an average person - all I am capable of is having these ambitions to become great.

My applications to grad school are doomed. I don't have anything to show for my years at college. My grades are worse than they were in high school. I have no extracurricular activities, while I did in high school (meaning my application is even worse now). I won't be able to show any summer programs on the app. And my research isn't going to help me either.

I also realized too late that the college I am in now is actually good. But I didn't appreciate it, and I didn't take advantage of it. So now, on top of my other failures, I feel guilty for not appreciating what I got. And I only am here for one more year.

I have come to the realization that I am not as smart as I thought I was. I realize that there is little chance for me to make a positive impact on the world. And I have no other reason to live, with that being lost to me.

Suicide would be the perfect way out, but I know that my parents and sister would suffer if I killed myself. So not only do I have to suffer, watching my life crumble to pieces about me, but I also have no way out but to suffer through it.

Today, my chemistry lab professor approached me towards the end of lab and asked me what I had in mind for next year. I wasn't too sure aside from organic chem, the common choice for sophomores. He suggested I take analytical chemistry with him. Taking that course and working with him would prepare me for a possible internship (called REU, I think?) he wants me to have for next summer. The internship would be pretty well paid as well as cover any expenses. He singled me out about this and told me he wanted me to take the course and try for the internship, that he would help me with it. He's known me since last semester; I've stood out to him in terms of grades, work ethics, personality, etc. I'm still very unsure about what exactly the internship is about and what not, but I'm incredibly interested. I'll be speaking with him as well as an advisor about my options and the whole deal in the near future.

I was curious though, what exactly is analytical chemistry? And what would be the benefits (or disadvantages) of taking analytical as a sophomore? I assume I'll be discussing this with my advisor, but I wanted to know what your guys' thoughts about this are. Also, any tips or suggestions?"
r7f3h,0,2012-03-21,Why am I not seeing size gains?,Anal_Justice_League,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/r7f3h/why_am_i_not_seeing_size_gains/,"Hello r/fitness.  First time poster here! :)

I have been lifting for a good 16 months now, with mixed results.  The first eight months or so I saw moderate strength gains, but little in the way of physical results.  After taking three months off (due to an internship) I got back into a new routine, as suggested to me by my friend.  The results have been both positive and negative.  The routine is on a seven day cycle as follows:

Day 1: Upper Body Power Day

    Pulling Power Movement: Bent over or Pendlay rows
    3 sets of 3-5 reps @105
    Pressing Power Movement: Flat dumbbell presses
    3 sets of 3-5 reps @60
    Assistance pressing movement: Seated dumbbell shoulder presses
    3 sets of 6-10 reps @50 
    Auxiliary curling movement: Cambered bar curls
    3 sets of 6-10 reps @90
    Auxiliary extension movement: Skull crushers
    3 sets of 6-10 reps @70

I know it's a bit superficial and cliche, but my biceps haven't grown an inch in over a year.  Even with moderate training, I would have expected to see something, even small.  They were 12.5 inches around last year, and remain that size to this day.  Unfortunately, I lost the log book in which I kept my old weight max's, but I do remember that the most I could do on a machine (I do mostly preacher curls with free weights now) was 100 then, but two days ago, I managed to get up to 140.

Day 2: Lower Body Power Day

    Assistance extension movement: Leg extensions
    2 sets of 10 reps @260
    Assistance pulling/curling movement: Glute ham raises or lying leg curls
    2 sets of 10 reps @170
    Seated leg press
    4 sets of 5 reps @950
    Auxiliary calf movement: Seated calf raise
    2 sets of 20 reps @640

My friend suggested that I start to take D-aspartic acid as a supplement.  In the three months that I have been doing so, I have seen weight increases in most every exercise, but have seen explosive growth in my legs.  I'm not sure as to whether this is a placebo effect or not (I have a hard time believing I went from repping 550 on legs to 950 in only three months) but I have seen some serious increases in all four leg strength exercises.  I don't do squats (even though I know I should) because even after hours of watching other peoples forms and having them watch mine, every morning after I do squats, I wake up with a raging headache.  

Day 3: Rest

Day 4: Back and Shoulders Hypertrophy Day

    Pulling Power Exercise speed work: Bent over or Pendlay rows
    6 sets of 3 reps with 65-70% of normal 3-5 rep max  @65
    Hypertrophy pulling movement: Seated cable row
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @110
    Hypertrophy pulling movement: Dumbbell rows or shrugs bracing upper body.
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @60
    Hypertrophy shoulder movement: Seated dumbbell presses
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @35
    Hypertrophy shoulder movement: Upright rows
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @60
    Hypertrophy shoulder movement: Side lateral raises with dumbbells or cables
    3 sets of 12-20 reps @20

Day 5: Lower Body Hypertrophy Day


    Hypertrophy pressing movement: Leg presses
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @600
    Hypertrophy extension movement: Leg extensions
    3 sets of 15-20 reps @170
    Hypertrophy curling movement: Lying leg curls
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @110
    Hypertrophy calf movement: Seated calf raises
    3 sets of 15-20 reps @400

Day 6: Chest and Arms Hypertrophy Day

    Pressing Power Exercise speed work: Flat dumbbell presses
    6 sets of 3 reps with 65-70% of normal 3-5 rep max
    Hypertrophy pressing movement: Incline dumbbell presses
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @40
    Hypertrophy fly movement: Incline cable flyes
    2 sets of 15-20 reps @50
    Hypertrophy curling exercise: Cambered bar preacher curls
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @60
    Hypertrophy curling exercise: Dumbbell concentration curls
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @25
    Hypertrophy extension exercise: Seated tricep extension with cambered bar
    3 sets of 8-12 reps @55
    Hypertrophy extension exercise: Cable pressdowns with rope attachment
    2 sets of 12-15 reps @80

Day 7: Rest

I am 6'3"" and weigh about 205.  I eat 300g +/- carbs a day, 200g +/- proten and consume enough calories to gain weight while working out despite my tremendous metabolism.  I take NO Xplode and as I mentioned before, D-aspartic Acid.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

r7esl,0,2012-03-21,Why the ending I think is Brilliantly Crafted,succulentjoint,masseffect,https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/r7esl/why_the_ending_i_think_is_brilliantly_crafted/,"http://uninhibitedandunrepentant.tumblr.com/post/19344938387/mind-holy-fuck

First, I want to apologize for my troll post before, but I was frustrated by all of the posts that simply complained without any justification. 

that said, I agree that the ending should have provided closure, but as it stands now I am not disappointed with it. Like this author explained, one of the themes of Mass Effect is what it means to be a living, thinking being with free will. This is why the Reapers are so sinister and a phenomenally crafted villain. It's not enough for them to simply want to kill us all, they want to crush our spirits and our hope and they want to take away our free will.  In my opinion, Bioware conveyed this idea perfectly by making the same effect that happened to so many others in the Mass Effect universe happen to the player. It was easy for us as Shephard to sit there and play through Mass Effect 1 and think to ourselves, ""Saren you idiot, what don't you get? THE REAPERS ARE TRICKING YOU, YOU FOOL"" but for those of you who did not destroy the Reapers in the final choice, you have succumbed in a similar manner that Saren, Udina, TIM, etc. did.  For the reasons I have just described, I believe the ending was perfect. It was crafted in such a way that the game extended beyond a simple morality selection. They have made the game come alive in the real world.  I think it is pretty clear that the ending was in Shephard's head, and not some hastily cobbled ending created by interns trying to make a deadline. 

After reading that blog post, would you really have preferred some cheesy ending where maybe Shephard sacrifices himself for the sake of humanity or something like that? Maybe you do. I'd prefer civil discussion, not flames about how the ending sucked without justification. 

At this point, though, the damage is done, the complainers have won, and it appears that Bioware will do something to ""fix"" their ending. I think it's a shame that they have to do that, but hey, it's just my opinion."

____________________________________________

**The Story**

We met in college my Senior Year her Freshman Year.  It was a blind date (read: no social skills on my part) set up by my best friend and his now wife to be a double date with seeing a movie and coffee.  Things started off real slow and progressed as a normal relationship should.  I ended up graduating college 1.5 years later and moved up north, about 5 hours away from her to pursue my career.  Like every long distance relationship, it started off very well with us both making time to see each other on weekends.  After about a year of this distance thing, the relationship we had started going sour.  She left to study abroad and we spent the first 2 months of that fighting and seriously contemplating our relationship. Up until this point too we were talking about getting engaged, and every indication I had from her was she couldn't wait for that to happen  (read: ignorant and complacent).

We managed to patch things up and I flew over there, traveled and brought her home to the states again. Things were great after that.....for a while. Fast forward to one year ago when shit really started to hit the fan.  She was really distancing herself from me and, ignoring the relationship and I was letting her. **I was to afraid to confront her or even talk about how I was feeling**.  It eventually got to the point where she wanted a ""break"" to figure things out, me thinking this would help, let it happen. It turned out she wanted the break so she could go out on a date with a co-worker that had been flirting with her. During the break too was our supposed 4 year anniversary (St. Patrick's Day), where she went out with this guy at 5am to the bars and proceeded to post pictures of her hanging all over him.

After the break we started talking again and semi got back together but it wasn't the same, fast forward another cpl weeks where we went to a 3 day concert in the middle of the desert. We took her car and drove with one of her friends, the whole time she was acting like a complete **** towards me. By the end of that night I had had enough of her bs and laid into her, ended up breaking up for good when I found out she made out with the bar guy etc... (read: Mistake on how I approached the situation)  The next two days culminated in her stranding me in the middle of the desert 9 hours away from home, with no car, to ride home and no where to sleep.  

One week later I had to go pick up some stuff from her house and she did everything but got down on her knees begging for me to come back.  **I agreed and things were starting to get repaired a little.** We went out the bars one night and she got super drunk and started yelling at me because she thought I was seeing someone else....she then told me out of spite that she had sex with the bar dude the Monday after the concert.  To wrap this up she moved down to southern caliifornia for an internship. Up until the week before we ended things she was loving and excited to be with me, I came to find out she was dating another guy down in SoCal while we were trying to work things out.
_______________________________________________________________

**What All This Taught Me**

I learned a ton about who I was through this whole ordeal, most importantly however that I was **too afraid of rejection** to speak up or even talk.  I was getting rolled over in every aspect of the relationship which translated into my life outside.  I became depressed because my life was spiraling out of control and I **felt** I couldn't do anything to change it.  That was the single biggest mistake I made through everything, **I stopped believing in my self**, I had hit rock bottom, felt hopeless and didn't know what to do.  My life for the last 4 years was based around another person, causing me to forget who **I was** and what made me who I am.

I eventually realized, through a lot of introspection and surrounding my self with close family and friends, that I had a lot going for me and I was pretty freaking awesome and **nobody but myself could change that**.  I was a single, 27 year old male supporting myself, living in the heart of the wine country in California with a successful job, a car and my own place to call home.

I started putting my self out there in social situations, because the single greatest thing I realized was  **I am never going to overcome this if I don't try**.  I have taken one of my favorite quotes by a famous hockey player and turned it into my personal Mantra

&gt;You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. - Wayne Gretzky

Yes some of those shots you do take, leave you crashed and burned, but what do you have to lose other than hearing ""No"" or ""Sorry"". Take every situation you are in and learn from it, its the only way you can help yourself.

From that point forward I told my self I will never be that weak, uninspired person again.  I joined a philanthropic club in town, started working out and eating healthy and stopped stressing over the little things in life, because its pointless to do so.  Most importantly I focused on who I was and what made me happy, and haven't lost sight of that since.

Feel free to ask any questions of clarifications, I am an open book and hope this story can inspire you in some way."

We are both currently on our first internship. We wanted to continue living with each other, but my roommate's job is about an hour drive from school. Mine is only about 15 minutes away.

Now she told me that she didn't want to stay in our current on campus housing because it was too far of a drive to make every single day. So I agreed to look for an apartment with her. We found one that is about  half an hour away from each of our jobs (a little more for me because I'm now driving towards the city) so that she could avoid an awful commute.

But now that we have been living here for three months, she stays at her boyfriend's dorm room (which is on campus, an hour away from work) anywhere from 4-6 nights a week.

It just seems a little counterproductive to me, since she is now making that hour long commute most days as it is. Plus it's a little aggravating because my commute is now longer and she is never even at our apartment."

Personally I believe the idea of seeing and hearing God is a sign of Mild Schizophrenia due to the signs of delusions and hallucinations. The symptoms of this general field of the disease are telling the difference between real and unreal events, as well as having a strong belief of what is happening to you even when strong evidence is against your side, and problems with thinking logically. So to sum it up, a crazy person writes the Bible, people read it and accept it thus becoming crazy, which intern creates the symptoms listed above which applies to the mass majority of religious people (Not All religious people are this way). So people are okay with following the writings of a crazy guy? I may as well write a book that talks about how I was born on the Moon before mankind and I am some sort of sentient being and create a new religion all about that. Anyone who would believe me would be on the same level as the mass majority of religious people. Please correct me on any information I may have misused or put into the wrong terms."

Here are some of mine (I am aware I still may encounter some of these problems in other nations however I couldn't imagine having all of them in a place I would want to go). Oh and I currently live in the United States.

War, this is one of the biggest reasons. The US goes to war every five minutes or at least it seems that way.

Lack of Universal Healthcare.

Way too many conservatives. I can't tell you how many times I have been harassed and in some cases even threatened by conservatives because I'm liberal.

Circumcision, I can't believe something so bizarre and barbaric could exist in a first world nation. The only nation on my list of potential moves that practices this at all (besides Jews and Muslim minorities) is Canada and even there it is a much lower rate (around 14% now as opposed to US average of 50%).

The US has terrible sex education and extremely high STD rates. I had to explain to an adult man that girls start there period around the age of 12 (he thought it was 18). He didn't believe me (and called me a pedophile) so I got a girl to explain it to him.

People of the US are also extremely prudish, it's as if the human body were ""the devil"". OH NO A BREAST ON TV AHHHHH!!! 

People of the US are xenophobic and nationalistic as hell.

Americans are stupid and I almost feel as I am Joe from the film Idiocracy sometimes.

Ive been called a traitor just for wanting to move to another nation.

Things like Glenn Beck and Fox News exist in America.

I would like to live in a place where I don't see people holding signs with dead fetuses on them (or at least not as much).

Is there anywhere in the world where I can talk to a stranger somewhere and they don't look at me as if they are saying ""Why the fuck are you talking to me"".

Even though I'm straight, I would like to live in a place with better gay rights.

I also want to live in a place with a lower crime rate and also less police brutality.


I have a personal story as well. I used to be very patriotic when I was younger, so much so that I joined the Navy. While I was there I was threatened for being different and just for not being a psychopath like them. I remember having people bang on my door in the middle of the night saying they wanted to kill me. Some even said they were going to rape me. I got out for pretending to be suicidal and I have a deep hatred for the US military. Ive tried explaining to people what they are really like but no one believes me. I hate being in a stadium and seeing military people being honored and cheered for (trust me they are a bunch of disgusting and evil red necks). Yes now I know every country cheers for there military but the big difference for me would be that if I were somewhere else, those people in that military never did anything personally wrong to me therefore I have nothing against them. Ultimately I would view renouncing my US citizenship as an act of revenge against the US military. 

Also I have mild aspergers syndrome and when I was diagnosed (shortly after getting out of the Navy) they told me I will always pretty much be a ""foreigner in my own land"". So if I'm always going to be different, wouldn't it make sense to just leave the country? At least if I was foreign I would be expected to be different.

Also my childhood here if full of bad memories. I remember cars driving by and throwing bricks and me and being screamed at. I remember people pretending to be my friend only so they can play some kind of sick joke. Even now Ive been harassed by older overweight conservatives just for having different beliefs. I had the realization a few years ago that almost everyone who has done anything bad to me has been an American.

I'm currently a junior in college and 23 years old. I plan to attempt my move after I graduate. My family is well off financially and willing to help me move.

Considering my incomplete list, what nation do you think would be good for me? Canada, Most West European Nations and Uruguay are the ones I'm considering now. I speak English and French (poorly) but could always learn something else.

Edit: More reasons, US doesn't use the metric system (this one really annoys me)

Only two political parties to choose from (and they are both crap).

Also yes everyone I know every place has it's faults and problems. Nowhere is perfect.

Also I know how to leave and things like that, I'm going to attempt to get an internship and do a study abroad program. Also in case you are wondering I have never lived anywhere else but I have visited many. I made this topic only to tell you some of my reasons for wanting to leave and asking other people their reasons.

Edit: Also I've made my mind up to leave the US. Even if everything else were the same, if I was a citizen of another nation I could have the satisfaction that I would not be giving taxes the the US military that treated me so horribly."

I don't normally post with this account, but I'm a rookie attending and I've got until Monday (he's taking Step 3 now, and has the rest of the week off) to formulate a plan to get a nice, personable guy that's straight-up ""on the bubble"", and on *probation* as of now onto the right track. I've given him 2 weeks ""off"" so he can study and not given him shit so far. If y'all wouldn't mind hearing me out, I'd appreciate the perspective.

I think the problems are twofold and the first is easier:

1. He's completely ""gun shy"" now. I feel like the attention and probation has created a mental block. When pimped (by others) he shuts down and starts saying ""I don't know"" to things like ""Why was this patient admitted?"" even though I know damn well he knows why. He's lost confidence and just goes deer-in-the-headlights to pressure. He gives up easily now. I need to be non-threatening and nonjudgmental. I'm going to have to get inside to make change by being much more Jiminey Cricket/Tinkerbell than Mike DeBakey/Red Foreman.

2. This guy is missing basic, *fundamental* skills and ideas about patient ownership and what it means to be a doctor. I know almost nothing about his intern year, but I can tell he was just treated as a bad prelim, and idly passed along until he left, and I'm frankly pissed that this has gone on for over half a year more. He seems lazy, but I think that's just because he has no sense of ""this is YOUR job"" and ""YOU are in charge of this item"". He feels like a 4th year post-match med student that's still kind of ""checked out"" instead of someone sliding toward their 3rd year of residency. He forgets basic things like lab orders and consults even when I remind him, and when he does call a consult he seems to have fabricated no picture of where we're going with the patient, *why* we're calling this consult, what we want to know, and what we need the consulting physicians to know so they can help us. **He is somewhat disengaged, and seems to be constantly waiting for orders or criticism instead of using his brain to solve his patient's problems and propose new ideas to me.**

He's not the brightest med student, fine. Neither was I. But he's made it this far and I know he can't be stupid. It's just that no one has taught him the gravity of his job. He's not been advanced to the level of a second-year in terms of actively pursuing solutions, and taking ownership as if he were a physician working without someone turning the pages of his coloring books for him.

That last comment was snide, and I don't think of him as a drooling idiot, mainly because if I did I'd just bide my time with him, do all the work, and let him get kicked from the program. I'm too fresh for this to be ""not my problem"". My timestamp of experience is going on his brain, and he is given to me as a resident, so that means he should get more from me than I get from him. He does my busy work, and I take the time to give him my all and make him a better doctor the best way I know how.

Share experiences, please. I was just like he is, but as a starting 3rd year med student, and I can't for the life of me remember what turned me around. At any rate I don't think what transitioned me into ""physician"" back then will work this late in the game for him.

**TL;DR: Bad resident. Doesn't get it. Gun shy from criticism and that's making him worse. Fundamentally lacking, but not fundamentally hopeless, and not fundamentally a bad guy. SRSLY read the whole thing please.**

Appreciate the consideration. Thanks.

**EDIT: I have an idea!** So, most of our patients are new to him, and ALL of the treatment plans have been going 10 days without him. This means he's not gonna know anyone. So, this first week, *he* is the attending and *I* am the resident. Check it: His problem is not knowing what questions to ask to formulate a linear and multidisciplinary plan. *He* is now in charge of asking *me* the right questions and getting the pertinent data from me. Nothing is off limits. The rules are simple:

1. You must first check the copy-pasted assessment and plan and ALL of the relevant notes to see if you can figure out why we're doing/not doing something. He must find the deficiencies and things left undone. He gets to pimp me about why I'm calling/not calling certain consults. They are now his patients, and I work for him (in a sense) but that sets up number 2....

2. Nothing is off limits. The only stupid question is the one he didn't ask that fucks something up. No judgement, no intimidation. If he suggests an alternative I must entertain it and we discuss. 

Obviously, he's going to be doing all the work of notes, consults, and orders. This will put him in a vacuum of direct cause-effect of his patients for the first time. I'm just here for support and guidance!

Do y'all think this will work? I'm almost optimistic!"
r6b03,1,2012-03-21,Am I dating a psychopath? Or is he just a spoiled only child?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/r6b03/am_i_dating_a_psychopath_or_is_he_just_a_spoiled/,"I (F/21) have been dating my boyfriend (M/21) for almost 2 years now.

He is an extremely charming, gallant person with a lot of friends who worship the ground he walks on. His parents (who are angels) also worship the ground he walks on. They've tried to conceive for 9 years before he came as practically a miracle and they treat him as such - he can do no wrong. It didn't help his situation that he was certified a genius (MENSA) at age 6 and pretty much lived the rest of his life as a genius, getting into a prestigious ivy league school and landing really prestigious internships. He's also extremely good-looking and, aside from a brief awkward period during adolescence, always had model looks.

His parents didn't have much money growing up, so he wasn't (and isn't) spoiled materialistically. His parents pay his tuition, but other than that, he pays all his expenses from his summer job that he works his arse off at.  He knows the value of a dollar and does not like spending a lot of money on himself, but he showers his friends and his parents with lavish gifts. 

He exudes warmth and sweetness, but he has his times when he retreats from the rest of the world, especially when he is overworked. In fact, whenever one of his friends, or his girlfriend (me) is struggling, he is extremely attentive, caring, sweet, concerned, and helpful - when he is in a ""cornered"" position and can't escape - i.e. when I call his cell and he answers and says he has time to talk, when I skype him and he has no idea what it's about beforehand. When he knows I'm hurting or going through a hard time, he avoids interacting with me on impulse. He never follows up - i.e. ""how are you feeling?"" - unless I give him shit for being a jerk and never following up - THEN he follows up the next day because he doesn't want to lose me. He's obsessed with saving face (he's Asian, that might have something to do with it). 

He can be quite the asshole, it's as if he doesn't realize how some of the things he does can hurt people - it's usually the things he DOESN'T do that hurt people. I don't know if it's because he's a psychopath or because he has the ""I am the center of the universe"" mindset that excludes everyone else's concerns from his radar?

His parents both insist he's actually extremely empathetic and sensitive, and that he's also an introvert (his flamboyance and extroversion are just a persona) and tends to internalize things, so although he cares in his heart, he feels no need to express it externally.

He is very loyal and devoted to me. I don't think he would ever cheat, although he does have a mischievous streak. He doesn't like taking risks usually, but sometimes he does something completely crazy like cross-dress in public or skinny dip in 2ºC weather (it was with only guy friends though, and no, he doesn't have a gay bone in his body, he just likes the attention I think). He is a master manipulator, and can honestly do no wrong. If you accuse him of anything he goes ballistic and somehow always manages to turn ME into the monster for accusing him of such a thing - he makes me feel like whenever I have any concern whatsoever, I'm ""crazy"". When he is criticized, and his parents said he's been like that since childhood, he cannot deal - however, he quietly modifies his behaviour if the critic makes sense, without ever acknowledging them being right. He would never admit someone else is right. He does apologize though when he's obviously wrong.

I just spoke to one of his closest high school friends and she told me that he has had the tendency to retreat when others are hurting as long as he thinks no one is noticing - thus he is pegged as the ""fun-to-goof-around-with"" friend. He's very loyal and dependable to his friends and those he loves, however, if you want any care or concern from him you have to force it out. Because of this, I wonder if it is genuine. 

He loves animals and the environment, and he would never harm a fly. He claims to be a feminist but all his female friends unanimously agree that he is not. (To be fair, he was raised with a very old-fashioned, somewhat chauvinist father - although his father is extremely sweet - he is merely a product of how he is raised - his dad is elderly, born in the early 30's, and quite traditional). He treats people very well though, although he can be manipulative, idk if he does it on purpose though. 

[Please read this](http://www.lifeafterdatingapsycho.com/blog/2011/03/signs-you-might-be-dating-a-psychopath.html)- ever since I read this I got quite scared that he can indeed be a psychopath. 

All of these match how I feel about his behaviour, except for numbers 7, 9 (except he always expresses a distaste for my friends - maybe if I lived with him it would be true?), 12, 14 (although it has been suggested), and 18 (he cares so little about me that he never even asks what I'm up to - whenever he talks to me it's almost always about him), 

I notice that especially 21, 20, 13, 10, 8, 3, and 1 are very very true for us.

What do you think?

EDIT: I really do love him, our chemistry is amazing, he is extremely respectful to me sexually (he even told me he'd wait for me as long as I wanted, even if it means until marriage). He's a really fun person, very loyal and devoted, although he can be very self-centered. The good times are incredible. The bad times leave me feeling like a total unloved piece of crap.

I am currently sick now, and had to go to the hospital. I couldn't reach him for several hours, only when I got out of the hospital was I able to reach him on his cell (he had his cell off his person, clearly). He has not asked me how I am feeling and it's been two days. I finally called him and yelled at him and he told me he's sorry, that he has a lot on his plate too, and hasn't been sleeping because of his workload being too intense. He was the one who initially suggested I go to the hospital when I started complaining about my problem, but I put it off until It got very serious. He feels that he already gave me advice and stuff, and already showed he cared...etc.  It's  as if caring about me is a chore! That's not normal from someone who is supposed to love me!

**tl;dr:** I don't know if my boyfriend is a psychopath, or just an immature, spoiled only child who will grow up when thrust into the workforce. He has many of the qualities on [this list](http://www.lifeafterdatingapsycho.com/blog/2011/03/signs-you-might-be-dating-a-psychopath.html), except the really serious ones - he'd never lay a hand on me or anyone else and in fact has a soft spot for the disenfranchised/weak, and he is extremely honest (I think). All on the list apply to us except 7, 12, 14, and 18 (that's because he is too self-absorbed and doesn't give a shit what I do as long as it's not cheat on him), although these descriptions are a lot more severe than our situation."

r68ek,3,2012-03-20,"Reddit, I've been in a 3 year relationship, on the verge of marriage. We're taking a break and it's stressing me out to the point of depression. Help?",puckpuckpuck,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/r68ek/reddit_ive_been_in_a_3_year_relationship_on_the/,"Okay, here goes nothing Reddit. (This may be a long one.)

(I will first off admit I am a little drunk, so things may not be grammaticality correct, spelling, etc.) 

I have been in a relationship with this girl for 3 year. We have live together for 2. We had two dogs and two cats. Basically, we were on track for marriage. We have previously moved two other times, and were about to prepare for our third (and at the time final) move. On a couple of days before our third move, we had a talk about our relationship after I got out of work (I generally work late nights as a intern). We've had this talk before  about where our relationship is going before - while we had both discussed marriage before and wanting to go forward with it after I had finished college (she had graduated back in December, I had a year left). It basically came down to ""We needed to take a break."" 

She left that night to a friends. From there on out, I went to live at my mothers. We had many conversations that week that were emotionally charged and involved lots of crying. After the move, we met for dinner and drinks). We were both incredibly happy to see each other, with much affection from both parties. Since the break, we both managed to stay in contact, not just because of the move, but because of the obvious. After the dinner, we made plans to see a movie and just hang out at the mall (a bizarre choice on behalf of the mall admittedly), but those previous two encounters were distant and awkward. We were both tired, I from stress and her from having to take care of all the animals (I am not capable of taking care of any of the animals due to having a maximum of animals at my Mothers). Yet, in many conversations before, she had stated being sad about us not being together. She had admitted that she was sad because it was ""almost like she had lost a friend"". 

Yet, I was a lot off worse.

The reason for the break was because both of us had to deal with personal habits we needed to deal with. I am generally not neat, I don't eat well, I manage my finances piss poorly, and I intern for a company that is an amazing opportunity but bend ass over backwards for the in an attempt to get a job next seamster (or at least a paid internship as my current job pays nothing and gives no hours at all). She also needed to learn how to be independent of me, as she could not carry a conversation without even mentioning me. 

Or course, since I didn't want to force her into anything I obliged. 

Since the break, I have become increasingly depressed. I continue to use alcohol and food as a crutch. I am no longer happy anymore. She was the only thing that kept me happy apparently, despite having such great opportunities with work and college. I try to distract myself with work, but it only works when i'm there. I've gotten back into writing music, but once I hit writers block, all these thoughts come back. I skip class frequently. I lose sleep due to the stress. 

The big problem is that she can't keep her decisions straight. A week into the break, she wants to end EVERYTHING. I haven't even made any of the changes she had suggested. Her reason behind this was due to be being drunk at the time of the phone call and not having moved anything out of our previous house. Days later, we had realized we had a miscommunication about everything - she knew I was going to a beer fest and we had not discussed a date when I would move everything out. 

Our previous two outings together were very distant. She had wanted to go out just ""as friends"". I obliged, just so I could see her. Yet, it hurt for me not to get any affection from her. 

I have seen her once time since, last week. 


Since I have not been getting any sleep due to it, I was in a daze when I saw her (I had to get her money for final bills at our old place). She had noticed I was not right, and asked twice if I was. I, of course, played poker face and lied. ""I'm fine. I'm just tired.""

Co-workers and friends have even noticed my depression. They of course help, but I am the type of person that wants input from anyone that can give it, no matter their stance, position, or relation to me. 

So, I think that's it Reddit. Questions are encouraged, along with inboxes. I love this community and would love some sort of help. I still do love this girl and have invested a ton into this relationship to end it. 

Thank you.

At first it was an ideal job... started as an intern and got a wide exposure to different environments. Now? I find myself stressed to the max and wanting a new job!

Complaints start from our poor bonus system, no time compensation for weekend work during the week, being on call for a week (text alerts and client 'emergency' calls). We're required to get certificates to keep partnerships with Microsoft and Cisco... however; we're given no training and required to study on our own time (reimbursed for the test IF you pass).

I often feel my calendar is too jammed and I don't have time to finish things that I started. It's extremely frustrating when I find myself cheating on something and taking shortcuts because I'm limited on time. It's frustrating going to a client site and doing tasks such as moving computers to new desk and climbing underneath...

We do have internal support such as service manager, receptionist, sales, but often feel they're out of the loop not knowing technology itself. When someone quits, it takes FOREVER to get replacements if at all.

Can anyone shed some insight if these type of items are common for employed consulting? Should I be looking elsewhere? Anyone converted from IT Consulting work to full time defined position with one company and regretted it?

Don't get me wrong, this company isn't a complete bust and does better than what I'm describing. They've been around for 10+ years which is quite the accomplishment in a small / medium business. I enjoy working in IT but feel I may be at the point where I need to try another company. I'm rather clueless on what my job requirements would be for a single company of larger size to be honest.

r623h,10,2012-03-20,Soooo...I may or may not have had a super awkward interview. ,haneliz,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/r623h/sooooi_may_or_may_not_have_had_a_super_awkward/,"I'm a grad student and I am interviewing for internships for next year. I decided that I would LOVE to work with the LGBTQIA community. This particular internship involves individual and couples counseling as well as facilitating groups, etc., at the local LGBT center in my city. 

I just got back not that long ago from my interview. It went pretty well- I feel pretty qualified for the position (as I have a background in LGBT issues/history, and..well...I'm not exactly straight, I guess). In my awkwardness surrounding NOT having a good label for my sexual identity, I ended up just describing myself as an ally when she asked why I was interested in working with people on the spectrum. 

Later on, I asked my interviewer about this agency's policy on staff members being ""out"" to clients (because currently I am at a drug treatment center and we are NOT allowed to disclose if we are in recovery to our clients- something that differs based on the agency and its philosophy). I do have a girlfriend (I'm female) and I was unsure if it was appropriate to hint at this (or even to hint at an orientation either way). Somehow, I think the interviewer took this as my saying that I would have to ""come out"" as hetero to all of the clients instead of LGBT. 

She went on to give a spiel about if I were heterosexual and I intend to have to defend myself to other people and constantly let them know I was straight (""No, no...I'm not gay, I swear!"") or if I would be uncomfortable being in pictures that would identify me as working at the Center, etc., that this wasn't the place for me. She pretty much got the wrong idea all around (as I present very heteronormative) and I wasn't sure how to set her straight (no pun intended, I swear) and be like NO I'M NOT WHAT YOU THINK I AM! :P So I just let it go, and I'm just hoping it didn't hurt my chances there.

All in all, probably one of the most awkward interview experiences ever. 
 
EDIT: **TL;DR: I interviewed at an LGBT Center and the interviewer thinks I'm straight and had to make sure I was okay working with the gays.**

[**Pretty PDF Resume**](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B4GIqzrUBhnUNnJTQkdNU09UZHlUMjlnU3RKcUlIZw)

This is the first resume I've put together in a couple of years, so I'm looking for any feedback I can get.

Some of the things I'm worried about:


*  Is my ""Summary"" silly or too self-important?
*  It feels a little plain.  Should I add color, change formatting, use a different font?
*  I really do a wide range of tasks at my current job, I don't just stick to simple CRUD apps.  I'm also the developer who's brought in on the conference calls with clients because I know how to interact with clients.  I'm the developer who designs the databases, and who the other developers come to for help.  I'm having trouble making my resume reflect that without having seemingly silly bullet points.
*  I tried to organize my skills by some sort of category, while keeping the lengths roughly equal in length.  For those of you who know what these skills are, was this a bad way to organize them?
*  Although I only graduated recently, I have a large amount of work experience.  I got my first internship in high school which quickly turned into a non-intern position, with full-time work over the summer and part-time work throughout the year.  The second job listed was 25-35 hrs/wk during the college year and full-time over break.  Because of this I listed work experience first, my degree second, as I'm not looking for a junior or entry-level position.  Is this the right way to go about things?

TL;DR -- If you don't want to read my ramblings above but see something wrong or room for improvement, I'm all ears.

It became clear that the things that had appealed to me about becoming a lawyer were longer applicable to the profession.  I left law school to avoid racking up more debt in pursuit of something I no longer wanted.

Having done research on other careers, I feel a strong draw towards accountancy.  The problem is that nothing I've done to this stage has given me any of the necessary credentials.  I majored in Philosophy and Russian with a Pre-Law concentration in college, and took very few math or finance classes.

My questions are thus:  What are my options?  What routes are available to me if if I should want to pursue a career as an accountant.  If I did an MBA with some kind of concentration in accounting, would that give me the background necessary?"

I'm at a bit of a crossroads. I have two options for my internship: go to a foreign country and work at a new company OR take on a school project paid for by a foundation for disabled children. The internship will start in mid-April and last until mid-September.

I should explain the situation a bit.

Currently, my girlfriend and I are living together. However, we're sub-renting and the original renter has ran out of money. Within two months we'll be forced to move and our plan is to move in with her parents. We can't afford a home of our own because I'm working on school (40-60 hours a week) and she can't work due to an undiagnosed, but debilitating medical condition. Because we're young, we're ineligible for further housing assistance by the government. Furthermore, because my girlfriend's medical condition is undiagnosed she is still expected to find a job or go to school even though she cannot work.

Further compounding the problem: my cat, whom I have practically seen born, has fallen ill. He has fits of vomiting and diarrhea and will need medication for the rest of his life. But he's only 13 years old and it's not bad enough for us to put him down. He can't come with us to her parents, so he'll have to go my father. But I'm not certain he'll take proper care of the poor thing. So I'd prefer to check up on him every other week or so.

Finally, I'm not the picture of perfect mental health either. I'm terrible with keeping house and I've had assistance with that in the past. I'm worried that without my girlfriend around I'll get depressed and be unable to do the daily chores. This includes hygiene, groceries, cleaning and laundry.

If I go with the internship in the foreign country:

\+ Experience within a real game company  
\+ Work on a (hopefully) cool project  
\+ Gather connections that might last a lifetime  
\+ Exciting option  
\+ Might not ever get a chance like this again  
\- All my friends are far away  
\- Living in a foreign country I will never fully understand  
\- Won't be there (physically) to take care of my girlfriend  
\- Won't be able to take care of my cat  
\- Make a miserable wage, most of which will evaporate on living costs  

If I go with the internship at school:

\+ Working on a cool project that helps disabled people  
\+ Most of the hard work is already done, this is the polish phase  
\+ Small team, more responsibility  
\+ Extra money I earn can be saved  
\- Same students, same teachers, no new networking opportunities  
\- Safe option

I'm not asking for a final answer, but what would you do in my situation?

Thanks for your input."

I've heard generally positive things (and yes, I've heard about the programming team), but I would love to know more. If anyone has, or had, any experience, I'm anxious to know what you think. 
Any tips or information on helping me in deciding on what university to attend would also be highly appreciated. "

I have been struggling with what I want to do with my life for a long time. I have recently decided I want to go back to school for forensic science. I am super excited especially for the internship part. there is nothing I want more right now than to get an internship at the fbi or the state equivalent. I have been reading through the disqualifies and even though I have made some dumb mistakes in the past, none of them are dumb enough to disqualify me. 
However one of the dis qualifiers I found is about drug use of others. One of my family members and some of our friends do drugs other then pot. I have smoked pot in the past, but I have never done anything else. My past pot use does not disqualify me, but if i have been around others doing drugs within the past 12 months that could potentially disqualify me. I don't plan on applying for an internship for at least a yr, but I don't know what to do to ensure this does not disqualify me. 

I generally do not see my family member or others do drugs, but i am totally aware that they are. I don't want to stop being around my family member, but i also don't want their drug use to interfere with my career. "
r8m3w,13,2012-03-22,Why shouldn't I kill myself?,someguyaround,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/r8m3w/why_shouldnt_i_kill_myself/,"I'm torn between being too much of a pussy to stay alive and too much of a pussy to follow through. My reasons for not killing myself (it would hurt, and it's scary) — sheep shit.


I'm a Computer Science sophomore. In years, but not in credits. My funding came from a combination of grants. Turns out I'm a shitty student. GPA in the low 2.x. I'm a semester away from the rug being pulled from under my feet. Where is there then? Going back 200 miles and living with my parents back in dead-end town struggling to escape to Somewhere with the ""still-bachelorless"" elephant in the room, and having that rug yanked out too?


Everyone around me is flying past me at 200 miles per hour. Getting internships, passing classes, people actually like them, they're actually good at things. Every day is the ""how much better my friends and all these people who are not my friends are than me at life"" show, waking up and dealing with people MY AGE who are biologically superior ROTC fighter pilots and REAL engineers and badass competitive long boarders and a brilliant artist slash cunning businesswoman about to get her masters in four years flat and someone who is farther along than me in their freshman year than I am now, and what am I — a soft scientist failing at soft science? It's not like I'm sitting around doing nothing. I'm writing constantly — it ain't shakespeare. Constantly cooking for myself — two days ago I fucked up red kidney beans, yesterday I severely undercooked brown rice and to make matters worse, thought I could get away with mixing it with jasmine white. I've been playing violin since middle school — picking it up way harder lately, probably since I'm standing on the titanic, and still shit at it. Programming — I'm picking up iOS outside of classes and constantly trying to refresh myself with C, but fuck if I ain't at the bottom of the class and remaining there given the mindbogglingly meteoric pace of ascension of everyone else in the field. Longboarding — did it for a year and I still can't manage a simple fucking slide, and the only way I make it down any decent hills is sans-funny-business — Not that I don't do the funny business anyway — I lost the board ramming into a felled tree going downhill on an artery road. Japanese — self-taught, failed SAT Subject. Tennis — still can't manage a decent volley. Dancing — I've no-one to do it with.



On that note, kissless, hand-hold-less, look-in-the-eye-less virgin. Got into PUA. Ditched it. I'm not just chasing pussy for pussy's sake. Did the ""improve yourself,"" ""stop masturbating,"" ""stop looking,"" ""do hobbies and have ambition and passion and learn things and leave the house"" routine. I'm no neckbeard. Nor fat. I built, no one came. But at this point I've given up, because I don't deserve anyone, especially in my current socioeconomic standing. I used to think the problem was that I was shy, it just turns out I'm a shit person. 



They say if you want to get laid you go to college, and if you want to learn you go to the library — well I'm already in college and I have a hundred dollars of library debt from a time when I spent over a year accumulating nearly 80 psychology and programming books and missed due dates over winter break, absentmindedly forgoing online renewal. The best part is despite active effort, I'm still a shit psychologist (Oh look, I had a hard on for REBT and I'm still considering suicide, that's like knowing multiplication and not being able to add) and a shit programmer — obviously, given I'm about to flunk my major at a public university in the most education-challenged state in the US. I'm so ridiculously far behind in math that if an undecided major became Comp Sci over summer semester they'd finish before me because at least undecideds don't fail two algebras.



People hit me with the your life is easy thing. Oh, I live in the great US of A, I eat three safe meals a day, I have access to clean water and nobody's trying to shoot me. I have family that seems to not want me to die. I know these things are actually miraculous. AKA, there are people out there that deserve better than I because they're actually decent people but I'm the one getting all these benefits and opportunities and sticking my flaccid useless dry-ass dick in them, burdening the roads, the soil, the animals, the education system, my friends, my extended family, and my parents, meanwhile people my age elsewhere are getting blown the fuck up? What makes me so great that I deserve anything at all while better brighter people are getting shat on?


I've seen help. Last year. Once individual counseling, another time group counseling. They were nice. It was good. Things were okay for a couple of weeks afterward. I don't remember why. Probably healing aimed at a neurosis that has now taken a different form. I'm about to do more individual this year, but I decided to switch counselors and now I've got nothing until April.


I've seen the videos, I've read shit, I know about atoms and the big bang and how many millions of years and ancestors living long enough to get laid it took just for me to exist to write this. Yeah, miracles everywhere! And the whole ""oh, you're more important than you realize"" thing that seems to be quoted extensively but rarely expanded upon — when the rapture comes — because in some form or another our generation WILL get shat on by some kind of crisis, most likely peak oil hitting us FOR REAL — nobody's gonna be knocking on my door asking me to save the world. Nobody's gonna want my shitty suggestions. I'm second — nay, seventh — rate. I'm probably not even going to survive that. I'm under the value-filter.



If I could just live alone or roommated in a tiny apartment, doing dishes at a diner by day and coding by night, maybe, maybe, everything would be cool. But that's not the reality of it. The reality is that I'll probably just end up homeless. And then fuck that up too. 



I just wanted to accomplish something, even if it didn't matter in the grand scheme of the multiverse. But I can't even do that. King tut died when he was 19. People in Hiroshima and Nagasaki got hit when they were 19. Long ago the life expectancy was 19. Ain't no guarantee your whole life's in front of you. We're all flying blind. And I'm in extreme ache of a reason to when I'm in a toy plane with no wings and a backwards yoke."
r8l63,8,2012-03-22,Student org for IT majors is recruiting,mercury_83,MSCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCD/comments/r8l63/student_org_for_it_majors_is_recruiting/,"'Sup, Roadrunners?

I'm working with the school's CIS department to try revitalizing the AITP [(Alliance of Information Technology Professionals)](http://www.aitp.org/) Student Chapter. Commuter campus, so...you know, it's not exactly easy. But I figured I'd leave this here just in case any interested parties happen to stop by.

It's $30/annual for students. On a basic level, AITP membership lets you attend monthly seminars in Denver where you get to listen to a few lectures relating to trends/happenings in the tech industry, get some grub, and rub shoulders with professionals for potential networking and job opportunities. 

Kind of useful and probably pretty boring to most. 

We would like to turn the student chapter into something more useful, though. Help people pick up some of those skills that are essential to entry-level jobs, networking for internships and jobs, help out with class material (the programming doesn't quite *snap* into place for some), provide exposure to concepts and tools that Metro won't teach, or generally just share our collective knowledge and experience in order to benefit everyone involved. I've even got a few computers collecting dust in the corner that I'd be willing to donate as guinea pigs for people to practice things like installing/configuring Linux, hands on practice with taking computers apart and reassembling them, or any other things that some may not have the resources for.

There's potential there if people are willing to make it work, and these things always make for nice resume material (which we could also help you write).

Now for the painfully honest part... The group fell apart after the last batch of officers all graduated last year (or two?). So, this would be starting from the ground up. There are currently three people (myself included) signed up and associated with the chapter, and one of them I can't even get a hold of. So this is all very much in an alpha stage and not even breathing yet. The only thing needed is interested and physically present bodies (not often), though.

If you're down, you can sign up on the AITP website linked above. I'm reluctant to drop emails addresses on a public site like Reddit, so if you'd like to discuss anything just reply here or send me a PM, and I'll try to get back to you ASAP. Alternatively, you can just stop by the CIS department on campus and they'll direct you to one of the faculty advisers. 

Thanks for your time, everyone!"

I'm xbisexual,gender queer identifying male who presents as male. I work in an office for a small mental health program, providing office coverage, taking calls, and scheduling appointments. We are hiring someone to basically do what I'm doing, as I'm moving to an internship in a few months. An interviewee came in, and I immediately was able to identify her as a transwoman (no offense meant). She was dressed very professionally, and had a good feminine voice. I tried my best to be super friendly and welcoming, but obviously didn't want to identify her as trans. I can only imagine how stressful it would be to be outed or have it inferred that she wasnt passing going in to a job interview, even by an ally. At the same time, I wanted her to know that we have a very glbt friendly work environment. I ended up not saying anything, but as she was leaving, I made sure to compliment her signature, which she painstakingly wrote on the application. I hope I got my point across without making her uncomfortable.

My long term career goal is to be a therapist who treats the LGBT population, specializing in issues of gender. I know a lot of people here think you shouldn't have to jump through the therapy hoop to transition, but my hope is that I can help people through the discrimination and subsequent mental illness they experience. I don't think every trans person is ill, but this population goes through a lot more hardship and identity confusion than your run of the mill cis- hetero. I guess I want to know what I can do to be the best ally possible both as a therapist, and in less professional settings. I think I already handle this pretty well, but there is always room for improvement. I'm not particularly looking for therapy horror stories or ""don'ts,"" but rather positive experiences and observations. How can I let a trans person know how much I respect their courage without outing them or making them self conscious? "

Is this bad for getting an entry level job?",Chrono-chan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r8g1q/my_unis_software_engineering_dept_offers/,"The program's broad courses teach the basics of CS through certain languages.  For me, it was some basic Java and PHP (which is scary since everyone here seems to hate PHP here, but don't worry, I 'got' Java before seeing the 'bad habit' conventions of PHP)

They really push the SDLC here, and hammer in the importance of documentation, and design, not the intricacies of programming or languages.  Rather than give small assignments, there are lots of big semester/half-semester-long projects that go from idea to implementation.

I actually really enjoy these early parts, like documentation.  I fear the implementation because the programming courses are so so broad and in some ways basic.  I feel like I can't get a job, especially entry level, because I would fail any language proficiency questions asked.

I seem better as serving the 'real' programmers through coordination and leadership.  I know the least, but since I really get into the projects and dive in head first, causing stronger programmers to look to me for answers, which is a very interesting phenomenon.

I have not had an internship, but I did get hired for a few semesters with the head professor in the program, mostly doing visual design (I was previously an animator) .  I may have an opportunity to work for a web based start-up (though some people say stick with the Uni jobs), and I'm super excited to program more, especially on my own projects.  

With this basic information is there any advice you can give?
Is this 'broad' education 'bad' for getting an entry level job?  

tl;dr
My strengths are communication, asking tons of questions until everyone understands what's going on, and documentation, rather than programming.  However, I don't know how to leverage this in getting jobs.  Any advice as to how I can 'sharpen the spear' more?"

I got a reply that my background sounded interesting, and since I am doing a BSc in CS they'd rather offer me an internship if I have any programming or designing skills. This is an online newspaper, who also host conferences. And I am thinking of telling them that unfortunately I don't have many programming skills, but I don't know what an intern would have to know.

I mean, I have taken one intro to programming class and I am taking the continuation of that class right now, during this semester. I can write very simple stuff in C++, Java and maybe python. But I mean really simple stuff, like solving Project Euler questions, and the longest code I've written was 2 pages long, it was, again, to solve a maths problem. I have worked with regular expressions, but I always have to look them up online, I can't memorize them and I think I am a fast learner, but I really do only have the basics.

I would really love to work at this place but the most awful thing to do would be to tell them that yes, I do have some programming skills and then go there and be a failure. What would an intern need to know?"

I am...so...at my end.

I'm a 29 year old guy, single, unemployed, living with his mother, ashamed, apathetic and completely lost in sadness, regret and self-loathing. 

I finally graduated college a year ago, after moving away to Chicago by myself, where I went to a good school, got good grades, made friends, was happy and excited about my future. The problem came in 2000 after I graduated HS, when I started trying to lose weight. I have always been the ""fat loud funny guy"", which, hey, its nice to be that guy, but sometimes, you just want to be ""normal"" or ""good looking"" or ""taken more seriously"", so after HS I started learning about weight loss and working out. Soon I dedicated my life to it and the days quickly revolved around calories in vs calories out. In Chicago I developed exercise addiction, bulimia and anorexia. Food was now my enemy. As a guy, it is so weird and socially taboo, the fact that I've spent nights huddled over a toilet purging myself after binge eating. 


Soon, however, my weight started yo-yo-ing and I began to lose control. Binge eating was a big part of my early childhood and I was now doing it on weekends on occasion. I began being able to ""catch myself"", that is, after a weekend of binging, I'd fast for a week or so and exercise even more vigorously than before. 

College ended and upon moving back home, into my mom’s modest house (because I was to busy exercising to find a job in Chicago), I fell absolutely in love with this girl Ive known since HS, but because I was so fat and ugly back then, I've never allowed myself to try with women. At all. Ever. 

We started hanging out a lot, I'd always drive 30 minutes to where she was to go get coffee and being out with her, people always thought we were boyfriend and gf, it felt nice. She told me I could be her boyfriend when I got a job (I had a PT warehouse gig, which wasn’t good enough). Soon she got another bf, while I was again on the backburner. At this point I had begun taking myself off benzo's, as I've always had severe insomnia problems and had pretty much always taken a sleeping pill of some sort since high school. Coming off benzos would be the hardest thing I've ever undertaken, with exception to what Im going through now. I began having withdrawals, depression, inability to sleep, fear, incredibly anxiety, hallucinations, twitches, the whole shabang. I checked myself into a mental hospital to be safe as the combination of getting off that crap and me seeing her go through 2 boyfriends without batting an eye made me begin having suicidal idealization. 

I got out, eventually got psudo-stable-ish off the benzos and finally got a good job in computers. It felt like the beginning of a career, for me. I was pretty happy. We made a date to go get coffee, her telling me ""I heard you got a job, Mr. Big shot!"" which to me was everything I had been waiting for. I texted her the day we were to go hang out and she said she had forgot and was at a bar for her friend’s birthday and my heart was broken.   

A few days later, on fb I see that she is, again, in a relationship with someone, this time, it being quite serious with a guy in la who, for all intensive purposes, does what I should be doing (film) but obviously he's applied himself and worked hard whereas I've only worried about my weight. 

Next I lost my job. I wasn’t even there for 3 months. It was the first job outta college, the most important job of your life, supposedly. Its really the only job I've ever had that was serious, too. This was nearly a year ago, now.

Since then, I've made powerful steps towards completely destroying myself. I've tried to kill myself with overeating and though I havent succeeded yet, I am emotionally dead. Binge eating is prevalent in my life again. And when I say binge eating, I mean it emphatically. I would go to multiple fast food restaurants in one day, get the food, take it home, sit on the couch and just gorge. I easily threw back TENS of thousands of calories a day(spending $40-60 a day of my moms money to do so). This was my protective barrier. I would make myself so physically unappealing again that I would never allow myself to interact with girls or believe in myself for doing so, ever again. The plan worked too good. 

I did this for 8 months or so. I stopped playing ball, stopped going to the gym, stopped caring, about everything. This soon evolved into not going outside, not looking in the mirror, not wanting to hang out with friends, not wanting to do anything but sleep, cry and overeat, giving the beast more fuel to hate himself. I threw out all my fat guy clothes a long time ago, but I wouldnt even be able to fit in a majority of them now anyways, because Im just that big. I was never an XXL in high school, but to my chagrin, I am now (and then some). I only squeeze into a few gym shorts, sweatshirts/sweatpants and a hockey jersey. Trying on and buying new “big &amp; tall” clothes is just too depressing, I haven’t even brought myself to do it yet. I was a fat kid, then an athletic mid twenties guy, and now am nearing a clinically obese 30 year old, the roller coaster ive taken is just too much.

I'm bi-polar and have had 2 short episodes of mania this past year but the rest have been the deepest, darkest depression I can imagine or describe. Because of my experience with benzos, i am apprehensive to get on anti-depressants of mood stabilizers (i tried them when I was young and they were nothing but problems). Ironically, the greatest anti-depressant I ever gave myself was becoming addicted to exercise and maintaining my 162 weight, muscle mass and tone. That was the happiest ive been.

I'm so fearful about my future. I don't look for jobs and when I do, its so discouraging seeing the experience requirements and what not, realizing that instead of getting jobs and internships to put on resumes, I was exercising, which holds no merit today. Still, i don't apply or even draft up a resume, out of apathy or fear of rejection. I cant imagine what I’m going to do in an interview, when they ask me what I’ve been doing for the past 9 months or so, since my last job. I can’t tell them that I've been incredibly depressed, and have been busy destroying myself, emotionally and physically. But its worrisome as, clearly, I don’t care about self preservation. I no longer bathe or brush my teeth, let alone try and craft a future for myself. I'm 1/10th a human.

The apathy, towards both things I once loved (basketball, golf, friends, comedy) and the things I really should be working on (my future, career, relationships, myself, etc) keeps me under the covers all day, every day. I don’t know how to escape this. I can't escape my thoughts, this room, this house, this town or this sadness.

I think about getting back on sleeping pills and that's obviously quite scary, but I cant just wish myself to fall asleep at midnight or 2 or 4 or even 6. Sometimes, because of the way I feel, they way my brain is thinking and tormenting me, I just cant sleep until absolutely physically depleted. And obviously I will never be able to go to the gym and start working out unless I’m awake before 8 o’clock at night. This is no way to live.   


I don’t know how to fix my eating problems, how to tackle my resentment/regret towards myself, how to deal with my sleep issues, not to mention weather I should once again give a run at the lab rat game of anti-depressants or how to be able to step back into the gym and devote myself without thinking of all the negatives, time lost and pain I’ve accumulated. Id love to be able to say that I will one day love myself in this obese body, but I cant and I wont. I know, after feeling what I felt, leading the life, NOT of a fat man, that I will never be happy as a fat person again. I was the class clown, always confident in my ability to be funny, its what I wanted to do with my life (comedy) since childhood yet now, because I’ve changed myself from fat guy to swan to super fat guy, I just cant be myself. I cant even be funny or anything but terribly cynical. 

TL:DR: As of now I am a single 29 year old, the fattest of his life, living at his moms house, no job, no aspiration to find a job or friends or a significant other, completely wrapped in a cocoon of regret and extreme self hatred for all that I have given and taken away from myself. I am now a cynical being, whose religion is apathy, finding joy in absolutely nothing that he used to, feeling every day that the sweater is unraveling a bit more, and all it needs is one final tug on the string. Not sure about meds. Therapy doesn't really help. I am on my way to becoming a homeless person, i say this not in jest. There may be a bigger chance of that happening than of me taking my own life, which, i don't know if that's good or not. If anyone wants to talk...

r86ho,1,2012-03-22,I fit almost perfectly between Small and Medium for everything. What should I do?,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/r86ho/i_fit_almost_perfectly_between_small_and_medium/,"I have a 37-38 inch chest(not really sure where to measure), 32 inch waist(though I wear 31 for some looser cuts), 15 inch neck, 32 inch inseam. I kid you not this puts me in the worst possible position when I'm trying to buy anything online, and as your average college freshman I don't have a car to go around trying stuff out. I even failed when trying to buy [these exercise pants](http://www.amazon.com/Champion-P7083-Mens-Caliber-Pant/dp/B004G8PSBI/ref=pd_sbs_a_1), cause I feel like I'm wearing a parachute and they becoming sails when I cycle to the gym.
According to [this American Apparel chart I fall exactly in the middle](http://www.americanapparel.net/sizing/default.asp?chart=mu.shirts), and [this Target chart shows the same](http://www.incentranet.com/main/app/target/na/costore/target/?pg=sizing-info). What does MFA suggest I do? Even when went to stores over Winter break  4 out of 5 times I try the Small and Medium and neither will fit right. Currently at 166 lbs, 5'9"", Asian build. 

Right now I'm on a cut. Gonna stop when I hit 155 lbs, but after that I plan on bulking to at least 170 again. Any suggestions? I would probably fork out some money for tailored shirts once I need them but I won't be in an office for at least another 6 months, possibly a year depending on my internship opportunities.

tl;dr medium is too big, small is too small, what to do?

Thanks in advance."

**The Five Minute Interview**

It's been fourteen years and I've never told a soul about this until now.  Not that it matters much; they wouldn't have believed me and you probably won't either.  But, it's true.  I was there and I saw it with my own eyes.  To this day, I still am awakened at night from nightmares of it.  And, when those tight-lipped memories bubble into my subconscious, they share as much with wet dreams as nightmares.  But, I digress.  Let me start from the beginning.



It was the winter of 1997 and I had just moved to D.C. with my first husband, Lee, during that summer.  We had finished our undergraduate degrees at Texas A&amp;M, me with Journalism and Lee with Pre-Law, and Lee had been admitted into Georgetown's Law program.  The plan, ill-fated though it was, was for me to get a job as a journalist to help pay for Lee's tuition while he ""invested in our future"".



I was young, twenty-two at the time, a native Texan so constitutionally a greenhorn about the District that I believed my husband and I would have an easier time as an interracial couple there than at College Station.  In all my youthful enthusiasm I honestly thought I would easily land a job at a major rag, maybe even the Post.  After all, I had graduated Summa Cum Laude and was involved in all kinds of ""filler"" for my CV.  It should have been a cinch.



Needless to say, I spent the first three months getting a lesson in what the old boy network in D.C. thinks about Southerners, especially Southern women.  By the time Lee was registering for Winter term, we were dipping way too deeply into our savings and I needed a job.  With dejection growing frighteningly familiar, I tried the unthinkable to my recently emancipated mind: the college paper.



The then-editor of The Hoya took a liking to me for all the wrong reasons and hired me as his Assistant Copywriter, which essentially meant that I'd do the writing that he that was interested in but was too lazy to write himself.  Although I was thankful to get the job, this seemed like a downgrade from life in College Station and after a few days the editor, with his preternatural scrutiny of my every mood and curve, picked up on this and decided to play the friend.



""What if I told you that I've got the inside scoop on the biggest story of next year,"" he said, feigning breathlessness.



""I'd say you like to tell what we call 'Tall Tales',"" as I smiled courteously and suppressed my eyes rolling.



""Oh, this is the tallest of them all, honey,"" he continued, ""and yet it's the genuine article, if you get the pun.""



I coughed out a laugh.



His voice hushed to a whisper and he leaned uncomfortably close, ""President Clinton's errant cock has caught up with him.  The word up the street is that he's been having an affair with a White House intern and this isn't going Gennifer Flowers, either.  He's made plenty of enemies and they intend to put him under a rock for this one.""





Well, now this was interesting.  If it was true, of course.  Maybe you'll remember that a lot of folks were nodding their heads and saying ""duh"" when they heard news.  It wasn't like it was out of character for our President.



""I'm in.  What's the scoop?""



""Hon', I don't know all the details yet,"" as his grin broadened, ""but, that's what you're getting paid for.  What I can give you is a damn good lead.  None other than Hillary Clinton herself is coming to Georgetown to give a speech tomorrow and I want you to try to find out some details about what's going on in her personal life.  She knows about this and the coming shit-storm for sure!""



""Wait, you want me to follow her?""



""Don't be an idiot, Sheri.  She's got Secret Service and all that crap.  I've gotten her PR person to agree to you interviewing her for five minutes afterwards.""



""Holy shit!""""



He looked happier than a Jersey bull sucked off by Dolly Parton, ""Now, look, you can't go and ask her directly about anything because we're not supposed to know.  But, what I need you to do is get inside her skin and see if they're worried.  This bigger than just an article.  There are... people... who want to know.  Anyways, it doesn't matter.  Can you interview her?  Ask her some crap and probe how she's doing?""



""Y-Yes... of course!"" I tried blustering over my embarrassment and genuine nerves, ""It's no big deal.  I minored in Psychology.  I should be able to read her like a book.""



""Uh-huh,"" he dipped and smiled, ""you just get over to the Columbia room at fifteen of two tomorrow and make it happen.  Got it?""



I quickly nodded and mumbled affirmatively.



""Remember, you can't let on that you know.  I've been assured you'll have time up close with her, at least a couple minutes worth.""



  *   *   *   *



I watched the seconds hand tick upwards on the wall clock, ticking each step of the way.  2:16.  Christ, lady, how long are you going to be in there.



Her handlers told me that she needed to take a personal call and would be with me as soon as she was done.  I hadn’t so much as seen her and my nervous bladder was becoming dangerously full, though I didn’t dare move an inch from my seat.  I was going to get this story, come hell or highwater.





“...so you can meet here then?  Downstairs?  Alright, give me a few.  Yep, OK.  Bye,”  Hillary said as she stepped out from behind the door, looking distractedly at the ceiling as she walked and clicking her phone shut with a decisive clack as she fixed her gaze on me.  And, the performance began.



“So, you’re Cherry?” she intoned, extending her flecked hand as her cheeks blossomed into a convincing, many-ringed imitation of a smile.  This was before Botox, after all.



“Yes, Ma’am, ‘Sheri’,” I corrected as gently as was humanly possible, “I’m here from The Hoya to ask a couple questions about your speech.”



“OK, great.  Do you mind if we walk and talk?” she pretended as she briskly stepped towards the hallway, “I’ve got to meet someone in a bit and can’t be late.”



“Of course!” I hurriedly followed along with my Montblanc and pad clutched in hand, “Could you tell me about your plans for promoting SCHIP in 1998?”



“You know, we’ve got many things planned, um, hold on a moment,” she turned to the two Secret Service men shadowing us and added, “Guys, I’m going to need about thirty minutes.  RP at the driver?”



There was a long pause as if there was an inaudible sentence and then the two men in black said in unison, “Yes, Ms Clinton.  Understood.”



They disappeared behind us and we walked silently for what felt like minutes when she suddenly continued, “Anyways, if we’re going to make it a reality for ten years it will take bi-partisan support.  So, of course I will need...”



Her phone buzzed in a strange rhythmic pulse, almost like a code.



“I’m sorry, I’ve got to take this.”



We continued walking as she turned away from me to answer.



“Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Okay.  No, I like that a lot.  Uh-huh.  Sounds like fun.  It’s got to be fast though.  Wait, could you hold on just a second?”



Suddenly she stopped and with simulated embarrassment she turned back to me and covered the mouthpiece of her phone.



“I’m sorry, Sheryl, but could you wait here for a moment?  There’s someone who has something for me down here.  It won’t take long.  Write some notes or something.”



I was helpless to protest as she opened a nondescript brown door and stepped through, shutting it softly behind her.  I bit my lip and crossed my legs, my bladder directing my thoughts to where a bathroom might be.  As I looked around, I heard a slight squeaking sound and stared as the brown door leaked open, spilling a faint light up from its contents.



I waited silently for a moment and, hearing the faint echo of the First Lady talking on her phone, I edged suspiciously towards the door.  It beckoned now, stopping a full inch open, allowing me to see that behind it were metal stairs leading downwards.  As I bent towards the door, my hand almost unconsciously reaching for its handle with my heart pounding, I could almost make out what she was saying.



“You know what it requires... I know it to will be enjoyable... He had his fun, let’s have ours...”



And, then, like a beam of light, I heard another woman’s voice, “I’m ready to begin.  We’ve got a wait ahead and the sooner we start the better.”



Without a clue who was down there with her, my hand, slippery with sweat, pulled the door open ever so gently and, refusing to let my brain think it through, I stepped stealthily into the stairwell.  And, to this day I don't know what the hell I was thinking.



Hillary spoke, “When Bill left here in ’68 he knew big things were in store for him, just like Barry feels over in Chicago.  But, we can’t forget what we’re really about.  That clown John Paul’s time will be up soon and the families will be one again with a new Duce at the head.”



“Barry’s ready for that.  I’m ready, too.  I accept the rite and all that it entails.”



Who was this other person Hillary was talking to?  I crept down the stairs as slowly as I could until I could just begin to make out her face.  Her strong, even manly black features balanced mischievous feminine eyes that switch from stunning to withering in a temperamental instant.  I’d learn several days later that this was Michelle Obama.



Hillary cleared her throat and produced a small, yellowed book from her coat pocket and, drawing a deep breath, began reading in a solemn, serious voice.



“In 1430 our Endless Mother, Joan d’Arc, was accused of mating with Dunois’ donkey, among other blasphemies.  The fraudulent church of course could not understand the ritual of Saturn and so wanted to squash it, even though it secretly arose from their very own pope’s perverted sacredness.  This honor, this privilege of uniting Heaven and Earth remains to the sisterhood even today.”



WHAT?!  I gasped and felt for a moment like I was going to pass out while trying to process this unprocessable information.  Were they pausing?  Had they heard me?  Fear numbed my panic as I steadied myself on the railing and waited, desperately hoping they would continue, uninterrupted.



“Sister Michelle, the Seven Starred House was come to meet with yours today.  We have brought the Golden Ass, as has been ordained.  Prove your submission to greater path of the Order and in this moment wed the donkey with your gifts.”



It was then that my stupefaction cleared sufficiently for me to see that Michelle was wearing a long, light brown robe, several shades lighter than her own chocolate tone.  The robe had a silver fringe and lowered hood and, with me more in shock than had I been abducted by aliens, she pulled the robe cord open and stepped smoothly into pure nakedness as the robe fell behind her.



Her supple, muscular body stood erect, her pear-like breasts attenuated with her gaze, which was directed at something just out of sight.  Past the point of no return, I lowered myself downward, scooting a couple stairs until I saw something I had not seen since College Point, a gray Cypriot Donkey.



Hillary led the donkey to Michelle with a silver-looking rope attached to his tack.  It was easy to see that the donkey was a “he”; the donkey had an enormous grey and white penis longer than its ears sticking out between his furry legs.



Now, growing up in Texas, I’ve seen plenty of animal cocks and they don’t just go sticking out unless there is a female animal of their kind around or they’ve been specially trained to breed, like for artificial insemination.  This donkey, with his hard cock easily as long and thick as my whole arm had been trained for sex and what happened next made that doubly clear.



Michelle put her forehead to the donkey’s and cooed, scratching his ears before sidling along him and kneeling, her sable hands massaging his rear leg in circles that inched towards his cock.



“Hurry, Michelle.  There’s more to the ritual and little time.”



Ms Obama didn’t look up at Hillary, but nodded and smoothly stroked her hands across the beast’s leg to his massive, curved shaft.  She gripped the donkey’s huge member with both her hands together and milked it forwards towards the glans.  The donkey’s eyes blinked rapidly and Michelle, without hesitation, bent her face towards the donkey dick, opened her mouth very wide, and began licking and sucking on the pulsing head of his cock, still stroking his giant root.



Hillary meanwhile removed her pantsuit and stepped into some kind of metallic shorts with complex silver and golden patterns.  Attached to the front of these shiny bloomers was a large but short, tawny white cock made from what looked like ivory.  Hillary dipped her hand into a metal bowl of oil and liberally coated her artificial phallus.



“Let Heaven and Earth meet and the animal and divine again reign in passionate, frothing ecstasy,” she incanted as she got behind Michelle, who was on all fours as she continued to ardently give the donkey head and a handjob.



With an “amen” from both women, Hillary pushed the ivory cock into Michelle’s frizzy pussy and Michelle stopped sucking just long enough to emit a moan before she returned, smiling now, to felating the donkey.  Hillary looked down with unabashed pleasure as she fucked her initiate, writhing in pleasure as the donkey’s slippery pre-cum began to drip from Michelle’s dilated lips.



I’m not proud of what happened next.  In fact, I’m very ashamed of it and I wish it wasn’t part of the story.  But, when I decided to tell the world about what happened, I determined then to state the whole truth and not leave anything out.  Even the most embarrassing parts.



I’ve had a lot of time to think about it and I think I was extremely sexually repressed when this all happened.  Lee and I hadn’t fucked in weeks and growing up Southern Baptist the only thing worse than fucking was dancing.  I’m not saying it as an excuse, but keep in mind that I was, I think, more horny during that winter than probably any other period of my life.  And, we all know, Bill Clinton included, that being horny can affect one’s judgment.



Point being, I was in such shock seeing the extremely lewd acts in front of me that I hadn’t even noticed that my right hand had strayed to between my legs and down my panties.  My knee-length skirt was hiked carelessly to the side and my fingers pressed hard on my pubis as I slid my fingertips up and down across my slippery clit and sopping pussy lips.



I may have been even more surprised by the sight of my finger fucking myself to such obscenity than the otherworldly scene in front of me.  But, I couldn’t stop.  And, even if I could, I didn’t want to.  My hand thrusted up and down between my legs and I arched forward, beginning to cum as Hillary quickened the pace of her fucking Michelle and both women sung their ecstatic rite.



Just as I reached my orgasmic tipping point, strong, large hands gripped each arm and literally lifted me off the seat of the stairs and started downstairs!  I yelled instinctively, but one of the brutes stuffed a musky soft fabric into my mouth and I could only procure a muffled objection.



Then, to my abject horror and yet indescribably relief, I peed myself in front of the two woman as my captors reached the bottom of the stairs.  My face flushed with fiery embarrassment as I felt the hot, wet piss stream all over my legs and ass, soaking my skirt and dripping on to my flats.



When I opened my eyes, both women and the donkey were in the same gyrating sexual dance and the two Secret Service creeps were holding my arms.  Hillary smiled at me and licked her lips.



“Every ritual needs a sacrament.  You look worth every penny we paid that moronic husband of yours.  Don’t worry.  We won’t hurt you,”  Hillary stated authoritatively, “but, you’ll need to play your part for this to be fun.  And, just to erase any doubts about what you’re worth, you’ll be getting a generous... kickback.”



She laughed and the agent to my left roughly pulled a huge wad of cash from his jacket, throwing it on the ground in front of me.  Without delay, the men led me to a thick wool blanket and firmly lowered me to it.  The one who had produced the cash now took out a small tool, like a box cutter and in smooth, professional movements cut my clothes from me in a matter of seconds.  Suddenly naked laying on the bed, the Secret Service men stood up at my sides and the women eased to a stop in their bestial sex and stood up together.



Striding towards me, Michelle Obama soon stood over my recumbent figure, each of her feet by a shoulder of mine.  She got to her knees and squatted her dark pink pussy over my face, leaning forward and balancing herself on the back of a chair.



“Lick my pussy, heathen.  Make me cum with that philistine mouth of yours,” she commanded with beguiling strength as she pulled the gag, which turned out to be a pair of green panties, from my mouth and lowered her steamy cunt on to me.



I had never been with another woman, but I was too far gone now to do much else other than comply and so I raised my face to her glistening pink pussy and licked it like I had many times wished my own pussy to be licked.  Her pussy smelled like cantaloupe and it was wet with her slippery horniness, which soon covered my lips and chin as she slid her crotch back and forth over my fluttering tongue.



As I began to suck on her large clit, I felt my legs being pushed open and Hillary’s hands traced their way from behind my knees down to my ass cheeks.  Squeezing my buttocks and stretching my asshole open, her hands slid from my ass to meet at my aching pussy.  Still very slick with my piss and horniness, she slid three fingers from her left hand into my hole as her right hand slathered more oil on her strap-on cock.



Hillary pushed the head of the ivory cock into my tight pussy, stretching it to a barely comfortable fullness as the top of her pussy pushed hard onto mine with each thrust on her attached dildo.  Michelle grabbed my hair and pushed my face hard into her pussy as I heard motion around me.



“Oooooohhhhhhh...... YEEEESSSSSSSSS!!!!!”



Michelle came hard on my nearly smothered face and when I emerged for air I saw that the two agents had positioned the donkey over us, with his huge cock dangling right behind Michelle’s ass as the men stroked it and their own poles, which at some unseen point they had unzipped and begun masturbating.



Hillary leaned back allowing them room as she started fucking with deeper, longer strokes and the men’s hands dripped oil on my exposed belly as they moved the donkey’s cock just a couple inches from Michelle’s asshole.  One of the men begin probing two of his fingers in the nubile woman’s butt, generously lubricating it.



Soon all four fingers on his hand slid easily in and out of Michelle’s asshole and were replaced with the fat, oblong head of the donkey’s cock.  Michelle quickly vibrated her fingers on her clit as the men began pushing the huge penis into her ass.



“Mmmmm.....   Oooooohhh.....   More!!”



The men continued to slide their hands up and down the donkey’s shaft and balls, allowing the donkey only to enter about five or six inches into Michelle’s yielding asshole.  The future First Lady propelled her ass up and down on the animal’s dong, matching the rhythm of Hillary who was getting more and more vocal as she pushed her ivory cock into me.



“Eat my pussy, you heretic!” Michelle said as she roughly pulled  my head back up to her pussy.



As if in response, Hillary announced while she thrust her cock into me faster and faster, “the most sacred part of the ritual now begins!  Let us mix the profane and the sacred, the dirty and the clean, until we are one with the gods.  Purify us with what is taboo.  Expose our souls to the most divine truth: the mundane!”



All four of these shocking Bacchanalians then said together, “amen”, and even the donkey brayed as it came, overflowing Michelle’s lovely ass with thick squirt after squirt of donkey cum that poured out all over my breasts, belly, and down to the tops of our copulating pussies.  Michelle thrust her butt outwards over me as the animal spunk spilled from her gaping asshole and grunted, discharging a loud, wet fart from her rear.



She grunted again, and a huge squirt of donkey cum, mixed with her fresh brown shit exploded from her asshole and onto Hillary’s breasts and face.  Hillary licked her lips and slid downwards to lay right on top of me as Michelle moved forward.



“Mmmmmmmmm.....  Kiss me, disbeliever,” Hillary Clinton ordered as our bodies smeared the wet, slimy mess of donkey cum and shit between us and she tongue kissed me vigorously.


I could taste the sourness of Michelle’s shit in the salty glaze of donkey cum as Hillary fucked me faster and faster.  With a reckless abandon I’ve never felt before or since, our lusty, smelly rutting mounted to a mammoth orgasm Hillary and I shared for what seemed like minutes as my mind flooded with the most intense pleasure I’ve ever dreamed of.



When I awoke, I was in a warm, clean blanket and had been cleaned of all sign of what happened.  I never again saw or spoke to Hillary, Michelle, or either Secret Service men, but I was given the wad of cash and a very clear message that I would never be believed if I tried to tell anyone so why mess up my own life trying to mess up theirs.



I left D.C. that night, divorced Lee in a record two weeks, and moved to Belize before Spring where I’ve lived ever since.  I don’t intend to mess up anyone’s life by revealing this story and I’m sure you won’t believe me.  But, it certainly gives me at least something to think about when I figure that the Monica Lewinsky affair was probably the least scandalous thing about the White House.  And, even when it wakes me up in the middle of the night, I’d rather finger myself remembering that day than eat fried chicken.

In the end that gave me the opportunity to sit down for 3 interviews with the company with no success.....and now I'm pretty sure its useless to try again.

I'm working at a temp position with a team of people much older than me who are all in pretty shitty places in life.  I can't bounce from shitty job to shitty job and I need to take some time off to really work on my design skills.  I just hope it will be worth it some day.  Being unemployed or dependent on temp agencies is miserable and I can't imagine depending on this once I get past my early 20s.

This job is seriously making me more ""depressed"" than I've been in a while.  Not real depression, but the kind of bad mood that catches you off guard because you're not expecting it and you have no real reason to feel down.....and you're not 13 anymore so being a sad drunk is pretty fucking lame.

And now I'm about to head into work without sleeping for 2 days so excuse my ridiculous offmychest rant.  I know I'm not the only individual in this boat and I know many people have it much worse than me.  To my fellow broke redditors: fuck the HR departments who dont call back after an interview.

r82ps,27,2012-03-22,There is hope. My update 7 weeks later. ,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r82ps/there_is_hope_my_update_7_weeks_later/,"Hey r/leaves! I hope this post finds everyone in good health and fighting the good fight against MJ addiction. This sub-reddit greatly aided me in my endeavor to quit seven weeks ago. I would like to relate my experiences with MJ addiction up to now.




I have smoked since I was 17. I did not start the heavy abuse till I was 21. I started smoking MJ daily along with tobacco in the form cigarettes and spliffs (MJ and Tobacco). I really lost motivation for anything. My addictions genesis can be placed on breaking with my girlfriend of 3 years. This is a big pitfall by me, I turned to MJ to cope with our problems. I lost motovation to succes or do anything really. 




I began playing World of Warcraft, pretty seriously too. I started raiding 4 nights a week and toking. Combining those two addictions is far worse than any type of addiction I have experienced before. I was in my own dream world, a hazy fog with only the pursuit of purple pixels in my immediate future. I started to think more and more that my life's ambition of getting a minimum paying job and playin WoW was a reasonable one. 




I stopped playing WoW after I had a depressive episode. I crashed really hard people. Taken out of school a semester before graduation, put on anti-depressants and started seeing a psychiatrist. My parents, bless their souls, really helped pull me out. However, I still toked.




 I went back to university to finish my last semester. I decided not to smoke for my last semester. I was a semester from graduating prior to my bout with depression. Thus, upon my return all my friends were gone. It was a lonely semester but it allowed to focus on work. It was during this time that I realized my reliance on drugs (MJ prior, anti-depressants and tobacco) really messed with me. I quit my anti-depressants cold turkey but still smoked cigarettes. I graduated and returned home.




 I had graduated from university with a degree in a field I did not wish to pursue. I began to be interested in politics and realized that I wanted to make a difference in the government by helping to get decent individuals elected to office. After graduation, I landed an internship on a prestigious senatorial campaign staff for the summer with hopes of receiving a full-time position. 




But I also returned to smoking pretty often with friends. Towards the end July, my smoking spiraled out of control. I quit my internship because of that all too familiar lack of motivation. I was playing video games and started working at a restaurant as a waiter to supplement my video game and MJ purchases. I subsequently quit the job a month later due to heavy MJ use that rendered me useless.




During this time I met a girl who I began dating. Unlike any girl I have met, she understood and tolerated my MJ and tobacco habits. I only smoked with her once so all the other times I was with her, I was sober. The time I spent with her allowed me a glimpse of the other side of life that I used drugs to shy away from. The life of love and happiness generated by being with another person who understands your soul. I tell you this because she was/is my support system. 




In January of this year I made a promise to myself to quit cigarettes. I did it and have not smoked once since December 31st. I supplemented my cold turkey quit of tobacco with heavier MJ use, browsing r/stopssmoking for support and talking to my girlfriend about all the feelings I had been going through. Anyway, the MJ abuse full blow. It got to the point where I did not want my parents knowing I smoked MJ so I would hit my bowl in the bathroom that had an exhaust while sitting on the toilet. I felt like shit while on the shitter-a new low.




Finally, in February I decided to quit MJ. I came here to r/leaves for support. I quit cold turkey on Febraury 1st because I was unemployed, living at my parent's house, felt like a sack of shit and just generally sad about where I was in life. I had to make moves at some point. 




So I began my journey to sobriety. I frequented r/leaves everyday. This sub-reddit helped me immensely through the tough times when I would want to give in. Your stories assured me withdrawal was just as bad as 
I felt it was. I am confident in saying that MJ withdrawal is the hardest addiction I have ever kicked. It is harder than tobacco, anti-depressants and pain killers for me at least. It really sucked. I was angry, irritated, emotional and all sorts of sucky for 3-4 weeks. 




At the behest of this community I began working out and looking for jobs. I was productive, that's key. I found that you have to replace the time you spent smoking MJ with something else. I had a support system with my girlfriend. I talked to her about all the feelings I had going through this process and she listened. She was the rock I leaned on during these hard times. 




All my best friends smoked as heavily as I did, so I was hanging out with them less and less. It's tough as balls to be in the MJ smoking environment when you are trying to quit. I didn't hang out with them for the first 2 weeks of me quitting MJ. It's not a sign of weakness, just a necessary step. 




Anyway, after quitting MJ I started to feel the positive affects. The lift of a foggy haze, the renewed energy, one less mouth to feed (weed) and finally, the improved mental capacity. 



So now the update of how I am doing in life now. I have been doing fantastic. I got a job on a congressional campaign staff in a Republican district that has the very real possibility of going from Red to Blue. And I'm on the blue side. I moved out of my parents house. I work from 9am to 8pm everyday doing what I love. I have natural highs and lows during the day but the highs are a lot more frequent. I have really excelled however. They love me here and in my short time here, I was already promoted. I was told if I keep my level of work up then they'll have no choice but to keep moving me up and giving me more responsibility.    The hours are long but for the first time in a long time I feel happy in my life. 




I'm going to conclude this by saying, thank you r/leaves. I show all my friends who asked me how I quit, this sub-reddit. Everyone who posts here, whether you receive a response/upvote or not, are doing a great service to those in need. 




From the bottom of my heart, thank you for helping me. It's been a long journey so far but I have no plans on stopping this car ride that we call life-the sights are too damn beautiful."

I know many of you are college students and some are most likely not even in the field yet but merely searching around.  I think it's quite obvious that the job market for quality engineers is stable and growing despite a weakening economy.  Regardless of the financial benefit I know more happy engineers with their careers than any other profession (I don't know any professional athletes, though).  It's a great path to take.

If you have questions about school or the interview process I know there are plenty of others here that have recently completed or are currently involved and I'm sure they'll comment on their availability for you.  I am a medical devices hardware engineer currently but have experience in HW and SW from two separate extended internships.

I'd also like to know something for those who stopped by here that are currently employed as EE's...are you happy with your job?  What would you change?

Thanks!

I'm currently a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon intending to major in CS, with a decent level of experience in both Web dev and systems (most recently, I owned the [Stripe CTF challenge](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag)). I'm looking for development/engineering work, but if something *really* compelling comes along on the sysadmin side of things I'll take a look at it too.

I'll work anywhere in the US or abroad (provided I can get a visa), but I'd really like to spend the summer in either Silicon Valley or pretty much any major European/Asian city where I can mostly get around with English. Like I said in the title, I'm also really interested in startups, so if you're contacting me from a startup let me know what you do and who you're funded by!

I'm at the point where I am planning and teaching everything on my own for four English classes. I'm spending a lot of time on planning, and some of my stuff just doesn't work in real life--I end up scrapping stuff I spent a lot of time on, or teaching a lesson that turns awkward or isn't long enough.

It is amazing how little I learned in grad school about what the hell to actually have the students do once I'm teaching.

I'm not looking to just steal lessons word for word and save myself the effort. I'm just wondering if there are some good resources out there, preferably online, that have a wealth of lesson planning ideas. I have looked around on the web a bit, and none of the sites I've found seem to have the simple, practical ideas I am looking for. My CT helps me out a little, but he is pretty vague (even his students think so) and very busy with other stuff. Plus, he understandably wants me to use my own imagination and learn how to make practical plans.

Maybe I'm trying too hard to make my lesson plans epic. What I do know is that I am spending way too much time working on planning, and it is making it hard to write my portfolio, grade papers, sleep, walk the dog, talk to my girlfriend about anything other than student teaching and how stressed I am, etc. "

In Season 3, episode 12, Dexter finds out Rita had a 3rd marriage when she was 16... We've never really had any follow up from that other than Dexter didn't confront her because he has secrets too so he let her have her own secrets.  


Could the intern be Rita's son from that marriage? He's about the right age if we assume rita is in her late mid to late 30s. Never says if she had a son, but getting married at 16 seems kinda brash and a big reason to do so would be because of a kid. Just an idea."

[Willing to share any close calls with us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c444ojw?context=5)|I wrote this recently about an experience I had in Haiti after the earthquake...closest call I've experienced to date...
 |It was nine days after the infamous earthquake shot the nation of Haiti to the top of the world interest charts.
 |I was with a small medical team treating open wounds in a massive tent city near the center of Port-au-Prince, the capitol city.
 |This particular day, things did not go according to plan.
 |As I reached the top of the hill with my translator, Peter, and completely out of earshot or eyesight of the rest of our team, we were surrounded by about twenty very angry men. They were armed with blunt objects, clenched fists and were ready for their voices to be heard.
 |A man who was self-appointed ringleader got right in my face and began screaming...
 |“Why are you here?!”
 |“We don’t have any food!”
 |“We don’t have any money!”
 |“We are hungry!”
 |“My daughter is very injured!”
 |“Why hasn’t Obama come to help us?”
 |The men pressed closer, and by this time my heart was racing. 
 |I wondered how much longer until the beat-down began. 
 |I wondered how long it would take until I was unconscious.
 |I was speechless. My mind was flipping through a rolodex of things to say but every sheet came up blank.
 |So I prayed.
 |What happened next still astonishes me, and as I remember the moment, it still doesn’t feel like it was really me.
 |I placed both my hands gently on his shoulders (which, by the way, is the very LAST thing you should EVER do to the person who is ready to beat you down.)
 |The group of men all stopped and stared at him, waiting to get his reaction.
 |Then, out of my mouth stumbled these words...
 |“I am so sorry...I have no idea how painful and difficult all of this is for you, but I need you to listen to me...”
 |All eyes on the leader.
 |“Ok,” he replied, “I will listen to you.”
 |More words stumbled out...
 |“I don’t have any food...if I had enough food, I’d come back and feed everyone in this city, but all I have is medicine and I need you help...”
 |He looked me in the eyes, “Ok, we will help you. What do you need us to do?”
 |We explained what we were doing, they agreed, and I pushed my way outside the mob and began putting distance between us as quickly as I could. No sense sticking around a hornet’s nest, right?
 |But suddenly, a realization hit me, and I stopped.
 |If I leave now, I’ll only remember that man as the “angry guy in the tent city”.
 |I turned and called to him, “Hey, what’s your name?”
 |“My name is Isaac,” he called back, “do you want to meet my family?”
 |“I would love to meet your family,” I replied.
 |Isaac led me by the arm to a dusty sheet draped over some wooden rods, pulled back the flap and there they were. He proudly introduced me to each member. 
 |He wasn’t the “angry guy in the tent city”...he was a loving husband...caring father...a man defending his family. Just like I would have done.
[Thank you for taking the time to write out this story.  I find it completely amazing that you were able to relate to him after all that, I wonder if he felt the same way about you. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4451mm?context=5)|I'd like to think so. It was the most surreal situation I've ever experienced.
[That's.. incredible..   Have you been in a dangerous situation in Uganda as well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4456vt?context=5)|Nothing quite like this. I'm sure the day will come.
[What are the biggest problems with treating a former child soldier?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c442rux?context=5)|From what we've experienced, it's reintegration. Helping them establish a new sense or ""normalcy"" that doesn't have anything to do with ""kill or be killed"", or being used as bait, or psychological abuse.
 |We work with a partner Ugandan organization that will actually take many of these children (the majority of which do not have immediate family, or are not wanted any longer), and house, educate, and treat them in a safe, family-oriented environment. 
 |We work with another child psychologist who uses a lot of art therapies that have also been very effective.
 |Where our projects are based in Central Uganda (an area known as the Luwero Triangle), it has the highest population of abandoned or orphaned children in the entire country. We've discovered this is a direct result of the aftermath of the Bush War in the 1980s. When the current Ugandand president Museveni led a coup in 85-86, he also used child soldiers to take down the government. What's interesting is, while I don't know anyone who speaks favorably of Kony or the LRA, they were very supportive of the Bush War tactics. TL;DR - we don't like child soldiers if we don't agree with the politics.
 |When the dust settled in the Bush War, the leftover children returned to their villages to find many of their families had fled. When these kids hit puberty, they began fathering/mothering children, but no one was there to help them really learn the ropes of life. This has led to all kinds of problems. 
 |The struggles they have are deep seeded. They've seen/experienced/participated in things none of us will ever quite understand. From watching their parents shot right in front of them, to actually being the shooter themselves, to being raped a dozen times a day. Helping them to the point of processing and healing is long, and only for the most patient and caring.
[Fuck, those all sound like terrible problems to have.   Definitely gives some perspective to those of us complaining of our firstworldproblems.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4457v2?context=5)|It certainly makes our first world issues seem quite insignificant and silly.
[How is someone physically able to rape someone that many times per day? And, from a mental perspective, how does it affect their sexual development later on in life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445d2y?context=5)|It's different men. And, depending on the fortitude of the child, it can range from absolute destruction of their sexual development to leaving them relatively unharmed. Physically, however, can still be a challenge. Some of the rapes are brutally inhumane.
[You should teach those kids the stock market and turn em loose on wall street and take a percentage.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44a0jf?context=5)|GENIUS! Now I just need some brokers to help me set that up...
[How much money do you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44410u?context=5)|Last year I made $13,000 from my organization (and I have the W-2 to prove it). My goal is to make my entire salary from something OTHER than my non profit so I can put as much as possible into the work on the ground.
[Want do you believe to be the most concrete difference that you are making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44410u?context=5)|Most concrete difference is in building trust and relationships. When we first began, a professor from Coventry Uni in England told me to spend at least 45 minutes in conversation with Ugandans before they'd stop telling me what they thought I wanted to hear, and started sharing what they really thought. He was right. Once trust is developed, progress can be made.
[Do you pay your interns?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44410u?context=5)|All our staff / interns (including me) raise support.
[What do you see your self doing in 10 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44410u?context=5)|In 10 years, I'd like to be a bigger voice for effective work in areas of poverty and culture, but continuing to work with the people in Uganda I work with now. (They've become GREAT friends!)
[As a financial manager for several non-profits, I get annoyed at people who demand justification for salaries, especially administrative salaries. No good comes from starving the employees of social service programs. A staff of martyrs is not effective. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445fdc?context=5)|You speak truth.
[Can you please give me some context for the 13k, how much is used for expenses, do you have a high standard of living?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c44a5h4?context=5)|13k was my personal salary, out of everything we raised. And no - I don't have a high standard of living (well, not compared to most Americans). We live in a small house, have two used paid off cars, and no debt.

(i.e., here we come to fix all your problems because we’ve decided you can’t fix them yourselves.)  I’m hopeful that the KONY2012 campaign has awakened an incredibly healthy conversation about how we can work together for genuine good in the world. Warlords like Joseph Kony simply must understand that these kinds of brutal legacies will not go unnoticed any longer.  I’m hopeful we can take what IC has started and make it better with time. Just like companies produce better / updated versions of their products, so we must produce better versions of our humanitarian efforts as well.

They like the simpler life and I can't fault them at all.
 |I'd say the main issue we run into is simply access. All we try to do is provide access, then see what they do with it.
 |When we help install a clean water well, the village puts together a committee to oversee the well, they elect officials, develop rules, collect maintenance fees from villagers and run the entire program themselves...we just provided access...they did the rest.
[Thanks for the answer. Sorry, what is ""access""? For a water well, do you just provide the money? The engineering plans? Build the well yourself? Run the well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4450u9?context=5)|Funding.
 |We have a Ugandan staff person that hires local engineers / well companies to do the work.
 |We have another Ugandan staffer that runs a week long hygiene training for the entire village (that we fund).
 |At the end of the week we turn it over to the village and they (with our help) take the next steps.
 |We provide periodic followup.
[Why can't they build a well themselves?  Do they not have ugandan contractors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c446bji?context=5)|Functioning national government? Eh...not for the people I work with...which is why we work where we do.

I wasn't implying anything mean.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c446veh?context=5)|No worries. Just wanna make sure I adequately explain....we tend to take things like that for granted!

We've interacted with a few that are now adults with families, and when you encounter them, you can tell they switched off their feelings a long time ago. This frequently leads to abandonment, alcoholism, abuse, etc. Their wives feel a great burden for their well-being, but are often resolved that it may never change anything.
[ are they mostly empathy-lacking sociopaths who wouldn't flinch seeing a family being murdered due to their exposure to such acts on a daily basis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c442wt1?context=5)|One particular family we spend time with in our main project village watched their father shot to death in the foyer of their home...yet, they all live very normal lives, and we haven't noticed any lingering emotional damage at all.
[How did you end up doing what you do?  Thanks for doing this AMA!  Your answers are a treat to read.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4435m1?context=5)|The desire to work in the humanitarian field began when I was very young. In my early 20s, I worked with youth in several Christian non-profits, but finally got fed up with the religiously bent projects, quit, and started SafeWorld. It's been the hardest, most challenging, rewarding thing I've ever done.
[What do you think would be the most effective way for someone now to start working at an NGO?  I would be very interested in working for a charity overseas but don't really know where to begin!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c444rms?context=5)|I'd spend some time really thinking through the what's and why's of your desire...then begin searching from there...and get ready to not make ANY money :)
[Having worked for religious and secular non-profits, what do you think are  pros and cons of religious and secular non-profit organizations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c446kqx?context=5)|I'd say the biggest challenge is when an org (of any affiliation) veers too far into a particular agenda that people begin falling through the cracks. 
 |Pros for me (in a secular NGO) is that I can sit at many tables of conversation I couldn't if I espoused religious affiliation. 
[Do you know any specific places to go, websites where NGO's might pick up volunteers from for example? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445hm3?context=5)|I happen to be developing just that kind of site as we speak :)

 |Reality is - we're all broken people trying to come up with the ""perfect solution"". It won't happen, but my personal philosophy is to go in quietly, build trust and relationships, listen more than I talk, THEN take action. So far it's worked well.
[Last bit: Why do you think that people began using child soldiers? What makes them such a valuable asset? How 'big' is the child soldier problem in respect to the daily hardships (food, water, and medicine)? If people had fresh water, decent food, and decently equipped hospitals and pharmacies, would most of Uganda's problems go away?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445sxy?context=5)|Children are easy to control, and there's a lot of them. In the grand scheme, I think they just blend in with the grand scheme. They're used all over the world for violent ends, but I believe medicine and education are by far the greatest needs.
[What's up with that Zombie disease going on over there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c444w0u?context=5)|I'm not quite sure.

[I visited your website and it says 90% of donations goes to project work and 10% to administration/savings. Those numbers are too round to be actual average expenses and I can't find any audits posted on your website. Charity Navigator doesn't have your organization listed or your parent organization as far as I can tell. Could you point reddit to any more information about your NGOs financials? Also, just out of curiosity, do you guys do any kind of impact evaluation like surveying how many people are still using the bed nets 6 months later, if the bore holes you drill continue to function one year later, does waterborne disease incidence go down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445q7y?context=5)|For the last 3 years we operated as a branch of a larger organization and as of January 2012 became our own entity. I have PDFs available for the last 3 years of our specific accounts that I'd be happy to share.
 |As far as 2012 goes, at the end of the year, we'll fund an external audit and make all these numbers available ASAP.
 |We do indeed do followup on our projects. So far every borehole we'e dug continues to operate properly and water quality is good. We're just beginning mosquito net followup, but in the first 5 villages we've covered, they're still being used (we do a training for the nets before we distribute so villagers understand function and proper use).
 |Waterborne disease has indeed dropped, but we equate that more with our in-depth hygiene training rather than the wells.
[Is your job really stressful?  Do you empathize with the desire to run naked into a busy intersection ala Jason Russell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c444oe3?context=5)|There are days :)
 |The job can be very stressful, mostly because the world is an incredibly complicated place, yet in America we (as non profit leaders) are asked to make everything so simple that people can understand and be compelled to give. On the other side of things, completing projects are often more expensive than you planned...take longer than expected...and include a huge balancing act to make sure you're not running over the people you're attempting to help while trying to appease donors' wishes.
[Would you say that some attention is better than none?  I totally understand what you're saying, but it also seems like a good excuse for apathy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c446mha?context=5)|I'm convinced humanity doesn't ever need an excuse to be apathetic. We are pretty much experts at it. 
[There is a lot of time, money and energy spent tracking down war criminals like Ratko Mladic but that doesn't seem to get as much criticism as the campaign to bring Kony to justice.

 |Right now we're working primarily with a parish if 8 villages in Luwero Triangle, but we also have impact in Kampala, Manafwa and Gulu.
 |In all total projects, we've employed nearly 100 locals at different times. Currently, we're working on developing more long term employment opportunities (but that takes more time than I previously realized)

The prism with which they view culture, religion, and politics will never match ours. What they consider peaceful, we consider chaos...every nation seems to have an ebb and flow to it, and I think Uganda has been relatively peaceful for a while. That could change any day.
[Museveni is a much better president/dictator than Idi Amin was, but I am interested to hear what you think of Museveni and whether he is improving the country or hurting it. Also, do you get any funding from any governments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c446ymi?context=5)|Museveni is great at staying in power but his influence is fading.

[Why is that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c443845?context=5)|Currently there are a few opposition parties that are ""testing the waters"". Some of the protests are turning somewhat violent (although not out of control)...
[I remember in a documentary I watched about Liberia they said when the UN left all the generals would return and it would be just like the days when they would cannibalize each other. That was some fucked up shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c443845?context=5)|The current president once decried leaders who stayed in power too long...that was 26 years ago. Now the people are restless and while he works for more power, other groups are beginning to rise up.

WHat are the biggest issues facing the people of Uganda today? And what can Americans like myself, and others, do to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445k0f?context=5)|Honestly, I, too, have concerns about all of this. I’m concerned that it’ll become “just another hyped up thing”. (Because we’re pretty good at that in America.) I’m concerned that a NGO is participating in assisting a military operation. (However nuanced their participation might be.) I’m concerned that the people at the very center of this story (in the African nations affected) will be ultimately left out. I’m concerned too much time and attention and resources might be spent on the wrong things. I’m concerned about a renewed “saviour” mentality. (i.e., here we come to fix all your problems because we’ve decided you can’t fix them yourselves.) But… I’m hopeful that the KONY2012 campaign has awakened an incredibly healthy conversation about how we can work together for genuine good in the world. Warlords like Joseph Kony simply must understand that these kinds of brutal legacies will not go unnoticed any longer. I’m hopeful this will lead to healing and restoration of thousands affected by brutal injustice in the focal region. I’m hopeful we can take what IC has started and make it better with time. Just like companies produce better / updated versions of their products, so we must produce better versions of our humanitarian efforts as well. Working for good is messy, and we get it wrong…often. But snuffing out the flame of injustice is always a worthy cause, as long as our personal pride or ideology doesn’t overshadow the ones we’re investing in along the way. Human trafficking, child soldiers, and sex slavery are three abhorrent practices that cannot ever become acceptable. I believe Invisible Children at the very least has raised that point well.
[Oh god. I grew up in Africa but when to college in North Ametica.

Sometimes it makes my job harder because I'm not trying to advertise the hell out of my projects. I'd rather go quietly and not run the risk of the people I work with feeling like I'm using them as a marketing ploy. 
[My question is: Do you find that this makes your job harder? People not wanting to donate to what they see as a ""useless"" cause fueled by ""white guilt"", or is it far too common for people to blindly throw money at a problem they know nothing about, ala Kony?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c446vmt?context=5)|(I haven't always thought this way...learned some hard lessons along the way)
[I'm sure you need them now and then to be able to operate in certain areas and I'm okay with that.

ran8i,0,2012-03-23,Possibly wont graduate for going over word count on a paper. What can I do?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ran8i/possibly_wont_graduate_for_going_over_word_count/,"I've been holding off on posting this for a while, but I've gotten to the point where I need help. I know reddit is a friendly, caring community, most of the time, so I know you guys will have so decent advice for me. 

Let me start by introducing myself, I'm a senior in college. I've been attending Fresno State for the last 4 years, and I'm typically a good student. 3.7 GPA, and I usually get all A's and B's. I'm working two jobs, one at the school paper, and one at the local paper and I also and working an internship with Pokernews.com. This should be my final semester at State, but I've encountered a huge problem.


It started about a month ago when for one of my professors asked up to write a paper. I wrote the paper with no questions asked, and submitted it before the deadline. After submitting my paper, I realized I was a few words over the 1000 word word count, 35 to be exact. 

I spoke with the professor about this the day after I submitted the paper. I told him the problem, and even asked if he wanted me to resubmit a shorter paper. He told me not to worry about it, so I didn't.

I get my grade on the paper a few weeks later, and I had received a 0 on the paper with the only comment being that I had gone over word count. 

Immediately after seeing this, I sent him an email, reminding him of the conversation we had. 

This is what I sad: 

&gt; Professor XXXXX,

&gt; I spoke to you about the word count of my paper after class one day. It was at 1035, and I asked you if that would be acceptable or If I could go and fix it. You told me not to worry about it, but when I looked at my grade, I had listed a 0. I am wondering if there is anything I can do about this? Please get back to me. 

He responded this:

&gt; I remember this conversation.  I told you to not worry about it.  But you made an assumption; I did not say you would get credit, I just said don't worry about it.  And although you apparently didn't understand this at the time, I said that because there was nothing you could do at that point.  You would have had to fix the paper, and resubmit before the deadline, which had already passed when you talked to me.  The deadlines and rules about word count are strict. I would never tell someone that the rules don't apply.  Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.  However, this does not have to influence your grade that much, if at all.  As long as you complete all 5 of papers in the course, this zero you got for going over word count will be replaced by the average of the other four papers.

While this would usually be fine, I had work a double shift one weekend, and didn't submit a paper, thinking it would be ok and that I would be fine to not submit one paper. Now this 0 is coming back to haunt me, and it is making it almost impossible to pass the course, I would have to get a perfect on every last quiz and paper just to get a mid range D. 

I went and spoke to him the next day, asking if there was any possible way I could receive credit for the paper, and explaining that without the paper grade it would be nearly impossible to pass the class. 

His responses was I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do, the rules have to apply to everyone.

While I understand his sentiments, it's not as if I didn't submit the paper. I did the work. I submitted the paper on time. I studied the material and learned what I needed to write and do the paper obviously, but because I was 35 words over word count, I now cannot pass the class. 

Sadly enough, this is one of the last classes I need to graduate, and if I fail, I will not get my diploma. While it wouldn't necessarily be a huge deal, I could take another semester and retake the class, I sadly cannot afford to do that.

My question reddit, is what can I do from here? Where can I go? Who can I talk to? I've already spoken to my parents about the issue and they are supportive of me. I also spoke to my adviser who suggest I speak with the professor, which obviously didn't accomplish anything.

Is it fair to punish a student, possibly a lifetime punishment, for simply going 35 words over a word count? The point of school to me is to learn. I learned the material, and did what was asked as me, but because I slipped and missed a word count now I cannot graduate? I can understand losing a few points for going over word count, but to receive a 0 on a paper that I spent time and effort on is just ludicrous to me. I turned my assignment in on time. I was always taught that going above and beyond what was asked of you was how you got an A. 

Apparently, I was wrong. It's how you get an F. 

Also why would he tell me not to worry about it, if I should have been worrying this entire month?

Redditors, have you ever encountered something like this? What is my course of action here? I would really appreciate some advice, and some feedback, and I know this is a great place to look for it. 

I really appreciate all those who took the time out to read this.

tl:dr Got a 0 on a paper for going 35 words over word count, now can't graduate. Is this fair?"

T.T Please forgive me I'll fix that when I get home from my internship.

On the plus side I found a really cool mod that I think would be awesome on the server and wanted to see what everyone thought. Its called Tekkit and it adds alot of cool things you can do with the red stone as well as some fun things like mass relays and capacitor like devices! I'll like the mod below so everyone can check it out. If we are going to do it then you all need to download the client version, you can still run the normal minecraft when you don't want to use the Tekkit mod say in single player or on someone else's server but run it when you log on to the server [given that we do add it].

I was also thinking about adding REI's mini map mod which is included with the pack and would help with navigation throughout the server as well. It adds way points that you can tag with labels so that you can head towards a way point. No more getting lost! ...says the person that had to have someone come rescue them...

He has a fantastic career where we are living now. He won't be looking to leave for at least 7-10 months as he works in sports and he needs to get through the season. This will be our first time living apart from each other in those 6 years. 

I have not had good experiences with long-distance relationships. I know we are in a very good place in our relationship (getting married in October!!) and I do not worry about losing him or anything but I know I will miss him so much!

This will be the third, and they do it every month at a different venue. There are other bands to meet, bloggers, reviewers, radio interns, promoters, venue owners, etc...

I can make pretty good money working in North America for my internship but I have enough money saved up to do something like this.

Most international co-op programs set up with my school, I end up spending more money than what I will make...which to me..makes no sense.

I am also fully fluent in 3 different languages, and learning another one (at least gaining an understanding good enough to live in the place) will take 2-3 months. I am pretty confident in my learning abilities.

How do I do this?

I have tried applying to companies abroad but I feel as if I am wasting my time. When I use google I usually end up with paid services like monster (an analogy)

We've been together for about a year and a half. We've gone through a lot together and we love each other. At the time we started dating I was in school and she was in graduate school. I was being supported by my parents so I could afford to take her out on dates and to dinner. Since I graduated I've been supporting myself and through a series of unfortunate events was forced to move out of the rent free accommodations I was staying while attending school (my grandma's house) and am working for $8 an hour. 

I can barely pay my rent and bills now and usually we have been splitting the bill when we do go out, but for a period of time she was the one to pay as I was unemployed. She has brought up the fact that she has to pay numerous times and I try to explain to her that I just cannot afford to take us out. She knows that my patents were supporting me at the beginning of our relationship and I guess she got used to being treated that way, me paying for everything. 

She constantly says we don't see enough of each other (twice a week sometimes more) but we both work full time, her at an unpaid internship while getting her masters and receiving loan money. I try to explain that we are both working now and it won't be like it was when we were in school. She says it's not a relationship.

She also constantly brings up marriage and while I do discuss it with her and tell her that I do see us being together in the future, I don't quite understand the point of marriage if we aren't planning on having children. It doesn't mean I don't believe in it, I just feel like no way am I ready for that and I don't like feeling pressured to do something because society says you should. Maybe I'll come to understand it more when I get older but I honestly think there is no benefit to marriage in this modern world.

She is a great girl and I am happy being with her but lately it has been difficult, she has said she isn't happy, mainly because she has had to pay when we go out. Now mind you I am the one that is doing the driving always, with gas at $3.99 a gallon, I am always the one to visit her, that doesn't seem to factor in for her. She compares me to her ex boyfriend who sounds like a loser bum who she also had to pay for everything, but he wasn't working at all. She compares him to me also when I get depressed.

I don't know what else to do to make her happy, I can't afford to buy her dinner, but I did take her to see the lorax and bought her five guys recently so I mean I am trying. I feel like we get along great and always have fun when we are together. 

There is one other thing that is starting to get to me now. We haven't had sex. She is a virgin and has cerebral palsy and each time we attempted it hurt her too much. She went to her obgyn and got a gel that will numb her so it won't hurt her so much because she is extremely tight. We do perform oral on each other but no penetrative sex. I have been a very patient boyfriend and have never pressured her or made her feel guilty about it but I do not know how much longer I can go without. I am a very sexual person, her not as much. I just want to have sex with my girlfriend whom I love. I feel like that could be taking its toll on us also.

I know that was a lot to read but I needed to vent. Other than those things we really have great communication overall and we rarely fight. Any advice would be appreciated.

TLDR: girlfriend of a year and a half upset that I can no longer afford to pay for everything. Insistent on talking about marriage when I'm not ready or in a good place to even consider it. Have yet to have penetrative sex.

I've stumbled upon this subreddit multiple time lately from various other subreddit comment threads. Usually these threads show a complete lack of understanding for this type of goal, but I understand well. I'll tell my tale, with hope that it can continue to help, as I had never fully revealed everything until now. Sorry if this is a bit long.


I'm new to this subreddit, but not new to the idea. With a strong background in Roman Catholicism, I have always been *against* doing these things, but had found that it was becoming more difficult to stop. Sadly, when I was around 10, I stumbled upon pornographic content while looking for a certain video game online. This of course led to my inevitable and eventual downfall. Over the years it would get worse, sometimes multiple times a day I would indulge. At the end of the 8th grade, my Godfather died at 56. I was quite close to him, even though we lived far apart. It started to get worse from there. 


However there was some light at the end of the tunnel.


I went to a Catholic High School, where I somewhat quickly obtained the nickname ""Pope"", because of my questioning if I should become a priest or not. At first I think they were trying to make fun of me, but little did they know at the time that I appreciated it because it was helping me realize that I'm supposed to be an example. I tried really hard to quite porn and fapping. At the end of the year I went to a summer religious retreat that had a talk about all of this stuff. They were rather cool about it: There was no ""STOP OR YOU'LL BURN IN HELL!!"" speech, but rather a ""We've all done it, we all know why, but there's a better solution than continuing down that path"". After that summer I stopped viewing pornography. This was a wonderful success, because at least I wouldn't be corrupting my mind with new images.


The next year, new summer, the term ""Pope"" had become a term of endearment for me instead of slight mockery, as everyone knew me by this name. I managed to stop swearing, using curse words after this year. I know this isn't entirely related, but it's a form of self-control for sure.


Junior year rolls around, and I'm focusing extra hard on trying to stop. This is difficult, but one of the reasons is that I don't want to be reliant on physically pleasuring myself for sexual relief, and instead be able to transform these feelings into love for the girl that I had not met yet. Romantic eh? Well, I wasn't letting myself date in high school because it would've been quite a bit of extra work. Also, I lived 45 minutes from school, so it was unlikely that I'd find anybody close-by there. The year ends, but no definite success.


Senior year is here. I manage to go entire days without doing anything. I remember the amount of time I could go without getting longer. At first 1 day before relapse, then 2 days, then 4. Before I knew it I was going a week or two without relapsing. I was on the fast track for success. I picked up a game of DDR to help exercise to, since I was a bit overweight, and focused more time into exercise and less into sexual thoughts. I lost 47 lbs (~25 kg) (242 down to 195 (~120 down to ~98)) by the time college started. I was going months at a time without any urges.


It was at this time that I met the girl who is now my fiancée (we've been dating for 3 years and 7 months. After I met her I hadn't done anything for 4 entire months and then some, when winter break hit and I was overcome with boredom. Saddened by that defeat but still determined, I kept trying to fight it. I never hit 4 months again, though I had been able to often go about a month at a time without. She and I have never had sex, and won't until we're married in another 2 years. We both want to graduate from college, and have traditional Catholic views about our marriage. (We're open to other people wanting to do whatever with theirs, for example, gay marriage is just marriage and should be allowed by the state/any churches the want to, etc. We're both fairly moderate.)


Here's were it gets bad again though. So now I'm studying abroad in Germany. Yay study abroad, but that means no seeing my fiancée for 11 months in person. The separation anxiety of only being able to see the person I love on Skype, and the lack of the human touch, has caused me to relapse immensely; throwing away almost all of the successes that I've made in the past. When I'm with her, my sexual energy is transformed into the love that I was going for earlier. Alone, however, I'm left with nothing to quell the urges. I've had days again of multiple indulgences, and days in a row of these. There have been plenty of stressors lately about housing, internships, grades, etc. I had a bout of depression, but after most of it cleared up I'm feeling a bit better. Still, I'm trying to refocus on returning to how I was when I met her; completely fap-free and proud of it. Aside from my religious reasons, I really just don't feel good about myself whenever I do it. Looking in the mirror is hard, feeling happy is hard. I want to be free from this.


I'm currently pushing 3 days of no activity. I figured one way to combat the urges is to refuse to make myself food for the following meal if I do it. While fapping does relieve some ""need"" for sexual pleasure, it doesn't seem to outweigh my brain's desire to not be hungry. I'm hoping this tactic will work. People know I like to eat, so it'll make people really suspicious if I suddenly start saying I'm not hungry during meals.


I know this was extremely wordy, but thank you for reading if you got this far. I've come here for a kind of moral support group. Being abroad doesn't let me connect with the friends I normally could in person, but I know that this group will understand for sure. If there's anybody that would like to be like a ""responsibilibuddy"" to me and I for them (I don't know if you do that kind of thing here or not), then  let me know and I'll gladly oblige. It's always easier with more than one.


This time, I'm going for greater than the gold."

So my schedule is basically internship from 9-530 with lunch around noon, then I usually have class from 7 to 10. I can't really eat during class, and by the time I get out and get home, it's already like 11pm, meaning that it will be &gt;16 hours til I eat again. I can easily do 2 meals a day (one at noon and another after work) but I cant get enough calories in unless I eat fatty shit. 

Would it be okay to eat breakfast at 8 am, then lunch at noon, then dinner around 6? Usually the next day is my workout day, wherein I take bcaa around 10am, workout, and have my first meal around 2.

Its sorta like this:
Monday 12-5:30 internship, 6:30-9:30 class
Tuesday freeday except class from 7-10pm
Wednesday 12-5:30 internship, 7-10pm class
Thursday freeday except for class from 7-10pm
Friday 12-5:30 internship, then cry in my room
Saturdays are busy 9-10pm


I just dont have the right time windows to eat 3 meals between 12 and 8, but can much better do it from 8 to 4. What do you think, leangains?"

My primary choice is Mechanical engineering co-op but since it's so popular the minimum GPA is unusually high (~3.1). Last semester I had 2.8 and this semester I've been trying my best to get that raised.

In case I don't make the minimum GPA, I am undecided between mechanical tradition and electrical co-op for my second choice.

I'm quite interested in electrical as I am somewhat interested in circuits, but I'm very interested in programming.

Anyways, I'm not entirely sure about the traditional path. I really want to gain engineering work experiences as much and as fast as possible. I know you can take internships but I'm not too familiar on how that works.

What do you guys think?

EDIT1: Also bonus question, are there engineering companies that hire first year students as interns? I live in Edmonton if that helps. I just want to do something productive this summer!"

I am a sophomore CE major at Johns Hopkins looking for something worthwhile to do this summer.  I already applied to a few REU programs (Research Experience for Undergraduates), but I was already turned down from one program.  Also, I think these programs are aimed towards students intending on going to graduate school, and I don't know if that's what I want to do.  I'm getting a little worried that I'm not going to be doing anything this summer (and taking classes instead).

I was wondering what I should be doing to increase my chances of getting hired/selected for an internship.  I feel that just putting my name and resume into these big job databases are not very helpful, and there may be something better I should be doing.

I have a pretty good GPA, but I haven't really had any hands-on experience, and I see these internships as a way to get hands-on experience.  What should I be doing?

After that, he joined the army and served 2 tours in Afghanistan.

While I'm incredibly proud of my brother for all that he's done and I respect all that he's seen (which is much more than I'm capable of), he's always kind of been one to milk everything for every bit of attention it's worth. He's a compulsive liar and lives most of his life in denial. He claims PTSD but displays no symptoms except for when it's convenient. He's been lying to and stealing from my parents since he was 12. He's manipulative and kind of delusional when it comes to seeing who's at fault in most situations.

My parents are two of the most amazing people I know. Obviously I'm biased, but they did everything in their power when we were younger to give us the amazing, privileged life we have now. We were passed off in the hallway and given to 3098029384091 babysitters so that my parents could work their opposite shifts at multiple jobs, and they give us absolutely everything. I mean EVERYTHING. I'm at school full time and my major/activities I'm involved in don't really allow for me to have a job at the moment, but I've scored an amazing internship and will be working on the weekends and at night to make money to pay them back with.

My brother lives on money he gets from the army and spends it all on drugs, video games, junk food and at the bar. He barely leaves his room and just lays around all day playing Madden, refuses to get a job or go to school, and treats my parents like they're the scum of the Earth. Everything is everyone else's fault. We've had our brother/sister feuds, but he will stop at nothing to let me know he's won an argument. He has told me I'm useless and that I couldn't do anything besides school anyway, that I'm a cunt, he doesn't consider me his sister, etc. That's all fine, but then he'll proceed to act like these WWIII fights didn't happen when he needs a favor. If I don't do him a favor, I'm a selfish bitch and he spends all day brooding about it and yelling over me until he feels he's won, even after I've long given up. He never stops talking about the army and plays the army card every chance he gets, i.e. ""YOU'RE MAD BECAUSE I DIDN'T TAKE OUT THE FUCKING GARBAGE? I SERVED IN FUCKING AFGHANISTAN, AT WAR, FOR THIS FUCKING COUNTRY.""

Now, he makes more money in 2 weeks than my father does in a month and acts like it's a burden to pay him back for anything, even though my father bought him 3 cars and fronts most of the payments on his motorcycle. He never does anything for this family except start gigantic fights that causes everyone in the house to stop talking for days on end. He lies and steals from all of us but he's impossible to reason with, and I mean IMPOSSIBLE. Reasonable talking does not happen with him.

I'm half venting, half hoping someone can relate and tell me what to do. Thank you for reading, if you did. I know it might seem trivial, but it's really important to me and I just need some advice.

TL;DR Brother is a lying, cheating, stealing, selfish, manipulative, attention-seeking, horrible person and it's tearing my family apart. Help?"

Is it possible for a Brazilian MD (6-year med school graduate, with mandatory 2-year internship included, and a state/federal medical license), with no specialty (referred as general physician over here), to enroll in a residency in the US?

I understand that fluency in English is mandatory, but what are the other requirements? What steps must be taken? Where can I find more information on the whole process?

Also, could I get a rough estimate on the fees and tuition costs?

So backstory:

Last march I got a new job, shortly after my wife graduated with a bachelors in Chemical Engineering from Rolla: Missouri University of science and technology (formally UMR). Good stuff. Since then she had been looking for a job in the St. Louis MO area and has found none. She has found 4 jobs in other parts of the country but none here.

This has made her feel like a failure. In her head she needs to be the bread winner and she worked for 4 years toward that end and got nothing. She can't even get a job she is over qualified for. 

She has had internships and a 6 month co-op. Every time she does a practice interview she is told that she interviews extremely well and she always feels like her real interviews go well.
The problem is probably her low GPA. She worked her way through college and at Rolla ChemE is a very tough degree. 

While she looks for a job she has been working at a part time job. 

Lately the stress of it has been building. She has given up on ever finding a chem engineering job. She doesn't know what to do now and she is deadlocked. She doesn't trust education and so doesn't want to get a new bachelor's, she is looking into getting a masters but doesn't know what kind of degree to get. She has no idea what her options are and I have no idea how to help her. 

She thinks that since it has been 1 year without her finding a job that she won't ever find one. 


So what are her options? Is the 1 year mark really that detrimental to her getting a job in ChemE? What kind of masters could her ChemE degree help her get?"

I'm looking for any insight anybody has about BAGLY (The Boston Alliance of GLBT Youth http://www.bagly.org/ ). I am a college freshman looking for an internship this summer, and this organization caught my interest. I don't have much personal experience with the LGBT movement, but I have an interest in it and am looking to live in Boston this summer, so this seemed like potentially worthwhile experience. Does anybody have any thoughts/insight about BAGLY? Is it the organization they claim it is? What kind of people are affiliated with it? Does it have a good reputation (will it hurt/help my resume for future employers)?

rc0db,6,2012-03-24,"Another first car post, $9k max, considering 05 Subaru Legacy 2.5GT",[deleted],cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/rc0db/another_first_car_post_9k_max_considering_05/,"So I'm a 20 year old college student, I've had a sizable amount of money put away for awhile I never needed to use(scholarships). I haven't owned a car of my own(mainly because I don't want to pay insurance when I never needed it, I live on campus), but since I picked up an internship for the summer I'm going to need some of my own wheels.

Like I said, $9k is the max, $8k is more of what I'm aiming for. I'm not too picky, here are my musts:

1.) Reliable/Low Maintenance

2.) Reasonably good looks

3.) Interior better than what early 2000's American cars provided(I'm a sucker for a decent interior)

And some bonuses

1.) Little bit of power is welcomed(around 200hp)

2.) AWD

3.) If low power, good gas mileage(27~)


Imprezas and WRXs caught my eye, but seem expensive for what you're really getting. BMW E46s also caught my eye, but maintenance seems a little high even if the engine and transmission is reliable.

The only cars I've found that interest me are

2005ish Mazda3

2005ish Subaru Legacy 2.5(and possibly the turbo GT)

I was leaning more towards the Legacy 2.5GT if I can find a clean one in my price range, but was wondering why a car with a nicer interior, turbo engine, and nice exterior is cheaper than the 2005 WRX? Are there major reliability issues I'm missing? 

My commute is going to be roughly 75 miles a day."

I'm in college now, my 6th semester going for a B. Tech in IT, so I'm looking for a summer job. I've tried working in non-computer based jobs in the past, and I just don't want to waste the skills I've developed anymore. 

I'll be going back to school after the summer for a single semester, then back home to do an internship, and then start my career. I'd love to be able to do all these things within one awesome company.

Here are some of the things I'm good at:

**VMware ESXi/vSphere/vCenter** - I've been working with server virtualization for at least the past 2 years. Currently, I've got a 7 host ESXi cluster running in my home for training/lab purposes. Basically, a standalone vCenter server with 7 other boxes running ESXi 4.1. I've got neat things like DRS, FT, HA, and power DRS running on it as well. I've also got a whitebox iSCSI server to provide redundant datastores for my cluster, so I'm familiar with the working of iSCSI as well, and how ESXi interfaces with the technology (NFS too.) Currently, my cluster has 27 VMs on it. Most of them are 2008 R2 servers, along with 10 VMware View workstations. I usually only have ~7 of them running, which provide basic windows services to my home network. (AD, WSUS, game servers, server monitoring (PRTG), media storage, and HTTP/MySQL services. [Here, have a screenshot of that.](http://i.imgur.com/teh9U.png) (Awesome, right?) I've got VCP-5 training, but haven't gotten around to taking the cert exam yet. I'm working on that one.

**VMware View** - I've fiddled around with VMWare View, vmware's VDI solution, and I've got a working lab setup on my home network. Really cool stuff, and I'm pretty familiar with how one goes about setting it up and getting things running. I've also taken training for view, but haven't had the time to take the cert exam for that either.

**Windows Server 2008 (R2)** - Like I said earlier, I've got a bunch of 2008R2 servers running on my home network. I run AD DS (with a bunch of group policy stuff), DHCP, DNS, WSUS, WDS, and DFS. I've also got a contracting project coming up that involves setting up a first server solution for a local small business. Basic AD DS, WSUS, and WDS. It involves SBS 2011, not 2008R2, but they're basically the same OS. I've already got that all set up and running in a virtual machine on my workstation. So, I've got experience doing that sort of thing. Once again, I've got MCITP training, but haven't been able to take the cert exam for it yet. Oh, before I got into VMware stuff, I ran all my servers on Hyper-V inside 2008 R2, so I've got a fair amount of experience working with that as well.

**Cisco/networking** - I've got Cisco Academy CCNA training. Haven't got the cert, again, but I should be getting that *soon*. Since I've been in college, I've also been working with Enterasys network gear for the past 6 months or so, as I've been doing an unofficial internship at my college (for fun :D). Routing, switching, wireless, I love all those things. Networking is what I enjoy doing most, and what I'm trained in doing best out of all the various skills here.

Last but not least, I've got an A+ certification. I know, not the most useful in an enterprise environment, but it means I know how to diagnose/repair workstation and server systems, so that's a plus.

So, there's mostly everything about me you might want to know. If you've got questions, or an awesome job you might think I'll be interested in, just send me a PM, or send an email to n.graham1024@gmail.com. Thanks :)"

He is currently in undergrad for psychology and is planning on applying for Ph.D.s soon. However, because he's a transfer student, he's lagging behind and will probably finish up coursework next summer. So first question: is it too soon to begin a Ph.D. in the fall?

If not, what are good ways to spend the time off before applying for the following year?

He is probably going to start a research position at a lab in April, so he's hoping to be able to continue working there after he graduates, or find another lab to stay in. Do research labs typically keep students after they graduate? I'm pretty sure it isn't a paid position, if that matters.

The other thing is that he wants to do clinical psychology, specifically. So, while getting research experience is probably great for his CV, what other options should he consider, either as paid work or as an internship, to help with clinical experience?

Lastly: what are the pros &amp; cons of a Ph.D. vs. Psy.D.? He knows that he wants to work in a clinic and does NOT want a career in research or teaching.

I just graduated with a marketing degree and am finishing up a marketing internship for the Australian govt in Washington.

I've generally narrowed down my choice of cities to NYC and LA with the possibility of Chicago. How hard is it to get into a marketing associate/assistant or a social media role in these two cities.

Couple things:
-I've had two marketing internships in LA before as well as a marketing management role for a successful start-up in Orlando. I'm fairly experienced for a new grad and have a portfolio with some graphic design experience as well.
-I'm very mobile with some money saved. I have a truck and want to make the move and apply once I get to the location.

I know NYC has better opportunities but I've always loved LA. How much harder would you say the opportunities are for a new graduate with only a few meaningful contacts in both cities?

First time posting in r/urbanplanning. This is a career field that I've been thinking about for a few years now. I have a b.s. in political science, minor in urban/regional planning, and I've been thinking about graduate school.

It seems, though, that municipalities all over the country are feeling the financial squeeze. As far as I can tell, we are probably entering a long period of economic contractions and crises. Do you all think that urban planning is/will be a field that one can reasonably break into, or will planning become more and more of a luxury as cities try to grind it out through our period of long decline, resource crunches and decreased tax bases (I realize some of you may not adhere to my gloomy projections). 

In addition, I suppose for now the best I can do is an unpaid internship. The city (college town) I've been living in from time to time posts an application for a single. internship. position. in the planning department. I've been thinking about trying to force myself on them even if they don't have need for more interns... Can anyone give me any advice/recommendations on gaining some work experience? I'd even be grateful for unpaid but it seems even that is a botheration for some employers...

I thank you all in advance for any help!"

I just wanted to share a story of how an evangelical Christian family turned out to be my best friends and quite frankly saviors of my atheistic self.  This is not to say that God is true etc etc (I still don't believe).

I moved to Singapore a year ago for a prestigious internship because I couldn't find a job in Canada despite having an honours degree in economics (double majored with engineering). I moved around a bit, renting rooms from various landlords when in February I got kicked out by a landlord who despite being very nice while I was there ripped me off for a lot of cash (600 dollars worth).

Now my contract finishes in May and I may be leaving Singapore afterwards so I tried to find a 3 month minimum stay contract in Singapore and couldn't find a single one that wasn't a shithole. Now a woman I met maybe twice in the last year (but is a friend of my family's) offered me to stay at her place for as long as I needed to, in order to get back on my feet. She even refuses to take any rent (which I offered today), saying "" I just want you to start your career and become successful one day; you got a tough start in your working life so do well first and then we can talk about money at another time. If you can't make it big, don't worry- just stay for free. You seem like a decent boy; I don't care about your lack of religious beliefs."" 

So now I am staying in her younger son's room (he's in the army now) for free in an expensive condominium. Considering my salary is crap, I now finally get to save for my masters degree and have a quiet house where I can study for my CFA. (I plan to buy her an Ipad or something of value enough to cover the costs they incurred while I stay here)

This is despite my out and out atheism (although i do not discuss it with them in order to keep the peace).

**So to those few atheists here who are really railing against all the religious, don't get too prejudiced against the them and give them a chance; you may find that some of them really are nice and will help you regardless of your rejection of their belief.**

I'm launching an online video publication on music, culture and nightlife with a partner of mine, and we're looking to create the definitive voice for things to do in Vancouver; something you can just quickly go to and not only discover something to do for the night, but see some of the shows you might of missed and discover new sounds and places the city has to offer.

Our website is epicvan.com, which is currently in closed beta (which we show for our partners, so venues, promoters, labels and artists), it will launch within a month and a half. In it, you can find the link to our Vimeo page, in which we have a couple pre-launch sample videos.

I'm wondering if anyone would be interested in doing some volunteer videography for downtown nightclubs, people who we'd love to take on as interns and ideally put on a fast-track to pay as soon as revenue comes in.

While it's an internship, we currently offer some great perks for anyone interested in music or nightlife: we go backstage to meet the artists for a video interview, there's (of course) no cover (even for the biggest events!), free drinks (for most locations in the city), and after just one round of initiation you'll be able to bring a friend to spend the night at the event with.

If something like this interests you (you enjoy going downtown and being up late), please shoot me a message! We like to have a lot of fun, and if concerts are your thing, you will as well.

Now my contract finishes in May and I may be leaving Singapore afterwards so I tried to find a 3 month minimum stay contract in Singapore and couldn't find a single one that wasn't a shithole. Now a woman I met maybe twice in the last year (but is a friend of my family's) offered me to stay at her place for as long as I needed to, in order to get back on my feet. She even refuses to take any rent (which I offered today), saying "" I just want you to start your career and become successful one day; you got a tough start in your working life so do well first and then we can talk about money at another time. If you can't make it big, don't worry- just stay for free. You seem like a decent boy; I don't care about your lack of religious beliefs."" 

So now I am staying in her younger son's room (he's in the army now) for free in an expensive condominium. Considering my salary is crap, I now finally get to save for my masters degree and have a quiet house where I can study for my CFA. (I plan to buy her an Ipad or something of value enough to cover the costs they incurred while I stay here)

This is despite my out and out atheism (although i do not discuss it with them in order to keep the peace).

**So to those few atheists here who are really railing against all the religious, don't get too prejudiced against the them and give them a chance; you may find that some of them really are nice and will help you regardless of your rejection of their belief.**

Once from the end of May till early/mid July, then from mid September till some time in October and again for 2 months at the start of 2013. 
The internships are in Düsseldorf, Germany; Sweden (I still have to decide between Göteborg and Stockholm); and Osnabrück, Germany.

For one trip I want to go to Spain, France and probably Portugal. 

For the other one I'm thinking about travelling down Italy and then taking a ferry or flying over to the Greek islands.

I also want to go to the Neatherlands, Belgium and Croatia but I have to see where that would fit in best.

When do you think is the best time of year for each of those trips? Is there anywhere particular worth seeing in winter? I was thinking about working in the skifields from when I finish the last internship in Dec to when I have to go back home in Feb because I think it would be fun and relatively cost neutral. 

Thanks for your help :) if you have any tips on cool places to visit in these countries please share!"

I'm in the military overseas, met her while she was here doing a 3 month summer internship for her college.  We ended up accidently traveling together to numerous places (Berlin/Amsterdam/Trier) and just became great friends.  Shortly before her departure in August she made the decision to extend it 3 months, which then turned into a full year, effectively putting school off a year, in order to pursue a relationship with me.

It's now March and we've been dating for 7 months.  I'm separating from service this May, and the plan is to move with her to her home state and for me to start college this fall as a freshman while she'll be a senior.

She's smart, a senior in college so she's going places with plans for law school after, gorgeous and sexy, and just fun to be with.  We started dating around 7 months ago, I took her to Paris for our first real date!

Here's the thing.  She had some issues from an ex and she's past them now.  So of course hearing about the guy and having to tell him off/etc, I looked him up on FB. He's basically the kind of guy I can see her with.  A skinny jean wearing, tattoo'd all over, guitar playing, skating hipster type of guy.

By comparison I'm plain, wear jeans and button ups/tshirts, like being a homebody and playing video games/reading vs going out.  I don't play an instrument.

I know this is stupid, but I can't help feeling like her ex was way more her ""type"".  I just feel boring and plain by comparison.  Sure I take her out to neat places in Europe (were going to london tomorrow, and prague next week), make her laugh, surprise her with things.  I'm not a terrible boyfriend and she tells me how in love she is with me and how perfect I am for her, etc.

But I can't shake the feeling that I'm just easy to date because I'm so bland.

What can I do to get out of this funk?  Learn to play an instrument or to draw/paint/etc seems to be the easiest choice, but I'm not even sure how to go about that.  I've just never developed an artistic outlet.  

TL;DR what can I do to get over this feeling that if her ex hadnt been a bipolar abusive alcoholic, she'd be MUCH happier with and much more attracted to him than me?"

I know this would be really corny but would the accounting subreddit be for a change doing something along the same lines?  My idea would be making the upvote system appear as a basic transaction entry where the debit portion would be an upvote and the credit portion would be considered a downvote.

been Decided!",asano_man,minerapocalypse,https://www.reddit.com/r/minerapocalypse/comments/rb6ya/operation_hennessey_a_location_for_the_skylab_has/,"After much silence on my part (much of which was spent researching past successful ariel structures and studying the migratory patterns of local fauna), I have finally decided on a location for Operation Hennessey's Aviatory Research Facility, the SkyLab! [Here](http://imgur.com/7AXqp) is a picture of me in front of the location's 'entrance,' a free-flowing water elevator.  You might notice that it is in the middle of a desert.  This is so that there are minimal environmental effects.  Though Op structures are required to be built of the most ecologically safe materials, building carelessely will still have irreversible effects on the environment.

You'll also note that the sign says 'in progress.'  The structure needs much work before it can even be considered an official Op facility.  This is why I ask if Interns will be willing to come by and help with construction.  We will need a lot of help if we are to have the SkyLab on Operation Hennessey's roster by the time the Oceanographic Society holds its annual review of all its projects.  More facilities means more funding, so it is rather important!

I should only need 2-3 others (rather, that is all I want, as I'm not sure of the unfinished structure's stability at such altitude).  Because of the nomenclature of the contract I signed to build here, only members of the Op can help with this, so please don't bother asking if you are not an Intern.

A bit of a warning: if you are afraid of heights, you should definitely not come until the structure is finished.  When I went up to build the elevator I could barely see the ground through the atmosphere.  It is not for the faint of heart.

Thank you for reading.  Soon, the SkyLab should be open to the public.  Until then, please be patient; we are working as hard as we can!

--Man of Asano, Operation Hennessey Aviatory Research Branch

EDIT: It seems that in my exhaustive research, I somehow missed a flock of water fowl that apparently uses this desert in its migrations.  The wonders of the animal kingdom!  In any case, construction of SkyLab has been halted until after I've further studied this flock.  If I deem building it unsafe, I will have to find a new location.  Hopefully, it will not come to that."
rb58m,8,2012-03-24,Need advice on what I think is a big decision which my brain and heart can't agree on.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rb58m/need_advice_on_what_i_think_is_a_big_decision/,"To many of you this may probably sound like a no brainer but to me it is a pretty serious question so I would really appreciate any help.

I have been offered a once in a lifetime internship of managing an up and coming musician who has literally been tearing it up across the board. The job would consist of managing an international tour along with media stuff. Rational me says I should 100% take this, no question. And in reality I'm 95% sure I will.

However... as much as I'd like to explain the situation I don't think I could truly convey the emotion that it holds...

I've more than realized I'm an introvert, I am quiet and like to keep to myself. I rise to the occasion when I need to and that is why I've gotten to where I have academically and I guess, now, potentially a career.

However, I've never been truly, trullllyyy happy, joyful, especially with someone else. About 18 months ago I randomly met someone online. It was completely innocent as it was on chatroulette (innocent, I swear!). Since then I can't really explain what has happened... I haven't ever told anyone in my life about this... but this girl I met online has drastically changed my life. She's turned my mind from a bland shade into an energetic hue. We talk all the time, whether it's skype, e-mail, facebook, txt... w.e. She has in a sense, I guess, made me happy and is seriously one of my best friends. She's one of the few, if not the only, person I can talk to about anything. 

The question I have to ask is.... I have the opportunity of driving home from school with all my graduating friends before I take this job. The drive would consist of passing through this particular girls city... although it would cut the time off I have before this job seriously, seriously short, possibly to a few hours... 

A rational person would tell me to weigh the pros and cons, which I have and taking the job is clearly the right thing to do... However, this is the one and only chance I feel I have of seeing this girl in person, someone who has significantly helped me better my life, given me joy in pursuing my passion, which this is part of. I don't want to sound like a dip shit but she has taken my life, which seemed worthless, into something that has become worthwhile. 

My brain tells me to get on this job immediately, don't take any chances.... while my heart tells me that this is a girl worth pursuing, worth the risk.

Can someone please give me honest advice... I can't exactly turn to my friends or my family because they will think I'm crazy for wanting to pursue someone I met online.

I want more than anything to do both but I don't know if they can be done... Ah I think this sounds too silly but it's a dilemma for me.

Thanks."

I don't know what I'm doing anymore. Ever since I was young I had known that I wouldn't enjoy college. I was never a traditional student. I was often sick and missed a lot of school, never studied, and yet I still consistently got straight A's. People had always assumed that I cared about school, but it was always just something that I happened to be good at. I don't mean to imply that I am better than anyone else, I just have a different approach to the way I learn things and never needed to rely on trivial things, like trying, or studying.

Fast forward to where I am today. My stepdad is in the military and transferred to me his incredible education benefits. Tuition is basically paid for in full, and I get a ton of spending money. It's a terrific opportunity and I am glad to have it. However, I just don't think I can take it much longer.

I'm majoring in film, and I want to be a screenwriter in particular. I feel that writing is something that either comes completely naturally to you, or not at all. I don't believe it's something you can necessarily learn. For me, it comes naturally and I have never had much problem with it. Taking this into consideration, I don't see much point in attending a four year college program.

Now, I know this is a cynical viewpoint, but I don't see why I need a college degree to become successful at what I want to do. There are about a billion ideas in my head for things that I can write scripts about, and devoting so much time to college actually keeps me from doing it. I see no need to spend four years taking courses that I will never apply to my life just to have a sheet of paper that says I'm accomplished. I have my mind set as to what I want to do, and I feel that doesn't require a degree.

Is this a bad way to think? I really just want some advice. I have an amazing internship opportunity in Disney World next semester, and working there has always been a crazy dream of mine. After I cross that off my bucket list, I really don't want to go back to doing something I don't enjoy. I subscribe to the opinion that any time spent not enjoying yourself is time wasted, and I don't need to prove anything to anyone but myself. I'm not being intellectually stimulated by anything I am 'learning' in my courses, and I'm not pursuing what I want to do with my life. What exactly do you think I should do about my situation?

**TL;DR:** Want to be a screenwriter, nothing else, and I am being forced to take four years' worth of courses in subjects I couldn't care less about, while putting my own personal goals on the back burner."

I'm not a fan of the man, but his movies are usually something I enjoy to watch. This film was extremely different than Gibson's past work, but it was a solid film overall.


***GET THE GRINGO REVIEW***

Get the Gringo is unorthodox, in-your-face, and a lot of fun to watch (when it’s not trying to disturb you). It rivals other high-octane action comedies with its absurd action sequences (the shootouts often conjuring the spirit of Hot Fuzz) and its dry, often dark comedic qualities. With its macabre imagery and odd sense of humor, this film will not appeal to all audiences, but it’s the kind of enjoyable romp that most should appreciate.  
 
The film centers on an unnamed career criminal portrayed by a gritty, obscenity-spewing Mel Gibson. At the tail-end of a high speed pursuit, Gibson smashes through the US-Mexican border and ends up booked in a corrupt Mexican prison, losing the $7 million he had stolen from a San Francisco crime boss in the process. His experience on the “inside” while stateside seems to be of little value initially (“Inmates with guns? That’s something new…”), but with some tenacity and improvisation, Gibson manages to make valuable alliances and connections to the prison’s ring leaders. 

Gringo’s main source of tension comes from Gibson’s chance relationship with a 10-year-old prison-dweller, who was born on the inside and whose rare blood type makes him a valuable resource to the prison’s top criminal: Javi (portrayed by Daniel Giménez Cacho), a man who smokes and drinks in excess, and plans to use the boy as a forced liver-transplant donor. Gibson, while saying the course of rational self-interest, returns to the prison after a purchased escape to recover his money and rescue the boy and his mother along the way.  

The writing in this film isn’t always consistent, and can seem almost self-aware of its occasional campiness (“The name’s Richard Johnson”, “No sh** Sherlock”, etc.), but the quirkiness of the film as a whole keeps the occasional jarring line from creating too much dissonance. Overall, the acting is solid, especially among the Spanish-speaking actors. This isn’t Gibson’s finest performance, but his delivery reflects the film’s tone, ranging from carefree and confident assertions to deadpan comedic voiceovers (a la Nicholas Cage).  

Grunberg’s directing emphasizes the visceral qualities of the film while also enhancing the mood and tone of his scenes. Images of debauchery, sloppy drunkenness and drug-use are portrayed with shaky handheld cameras, while tight action scenes are shot with wide frames emphasizing the outrageous scope of the battle royales. There are a few very cool visual moments (the continuous single-take following Gibson as he burns down a drug den, steals its money, then stalks away) and some clever visual gags (literally “cutting the small talk” when Gibson’s conversation with a company executive abruptly cuts away to Gibson incapacitating the man) among many other moments that set the film’s visual style apart from comparable films. 

Despite its few shortcomings, Get the Gringo is a well-paced story with plenty to laugh and cringe at. This is a strange and over-the-top experience, but the solid execution makes it an experience worth having. Once you get over the barriers to entry, it’s easy to buy in to the silliness and violence. All you have to do is approach the film like Gibson’s character approaches life: “Ah, what the hell.”

I'm the most depressed I have ever been. I just want to work, move out of my parents place, and move on with my life. But I'm not sure what else I can do. I feel like I have reached the end.(I guess it's not as drastic as I make it out to be, but it feels like it to me).

A little background about myself I graduated a top 20 university in political science and economics. I didn't really know what to do with my life. So I played poker for a bit in Vegas and just bullshitted around. Then I started looking for a job in operations or financial analyst. Not having a ton of internships in college (since I wasn't sure about what I was going to do). I was at a loss eventually I found a shitty internship for this financial advisory. In case you guys don't know what that is. It's basically a sales person who calls up people and sells them shitty insurance and Mutual Funds. I'm pretty sure what he did to me was pretty illegal.( Aka no pay 40 hour work weeks and he didn't even have the decency of giving me an entry card). But since I had nothing better to do anyway and it was only for 8 weeks. I toughed it out. 

While I was looking for a job I noticed that most employers wanted you to know VBA (it's like a prorgamming language in excel pretty easy actually), Vlookups (takes like 5 mins to learn), and pivot tables (about 5 mins as well). So I picked up these skills through youtube videos and some books. I was able to implement them at the crappy internship. Cutting their some of their workload each day by writing a macro that automated re balancing and another macro that worked as a v lookup for zipcodes but better.

Now I sit here in my room and to be honest I'm sad. I always thought of myself as a pretty bright guy, but I don't know anymore. I know the world owes me nothing. But I don't really know what to do? I've applied to every job. Part time, full time, temp I'll take what I can get. But I can't even get an interview. No one will even give me a chance.... I even took most of the test that companies want from this site http://smarterer.com/. Scored expert on all the microsoft stuff (wasn't hard most of the questions are a joke asking about short cuts and simple excel stuff). Still hear nothing. I don't really know what else to do. Send out resumes over and over again on craiglist, efinance, monster, career builder seems pointless even though I do it everyday like a ritual. ""Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.""

My question is what are my other options? I'm taking my gre to maybe get a masters in accounting...But that's another year off. What do I do? I'm tired so tired..... 


If someone wants to see my resume/cover letters and give me some comments on it maybe. I have a ton of different versions. Dunno any kind of advice or help is appreciated.

I should start off by saying I live in VA, and I haven't researched anything on other states' CPA requirements as far as the 30 extra credits go. [Here] (http://www.boa.virginia.gov/Docs/Education%20Handbook%202011%20-%20Final.pdf) is a pdf of Virginia's CPA requirements (third page down) if you are curious.

I've never quite understood this. I've searched for quite a while for an article or blog, anything really, just something that offers a different opinion on it. All I find are people asking what classes to take. I have never gotten a straight answer from a professor, and everyone I've talked to thinks it's weird.

* Why can we take zero classes related to accounting, but have them count towards the requirement? 

If your answer is, ""Well, yeah, they really should be in accounting,"" then I have two more questions for you. Why is the requirement, then, not be a master's degree? Or, why was there a need for this to be instituted in the first place? If you answer the first with, ""well, a master's requirement would be a little too much,"" then why is the line drawn at a bachelor's degree? Arbitrary decision? Roll of the dice? If you're answering the second, you have to still take into account that you can take nonsense classes, so your answer can't be ""so that people would be more knowledgeable in accounting.""

Were colleges involved in any way in this decision? This seems to be monopolizing colleges as the only form of advancing your career path (to a certain extent), much like how the law profession functions. In fact, it's exactly like law. No matter how utterly well you learn the content on your own, no matter if you aced all parts of the CPA exam, you can't receive the certification because... you didn't take 30 extra credits of psychology and recreational fun? (not knocking psychology, it is a fascinating subject)

To go even further, doesn't the accounting profession essentially exclude (again, to a certain extent) people who know the material inside out and up-to-date, but don't want to pay the absurdity of college tuition? Private instruction or even personal instruction and an internship from qualified professionals would certainly give one as much knowledge and know-how as any other college graduate, but the requirement is to have a degree from a college. Why is this thought line pervading... everything?

I can't quite get a grasp on the rationale behind all this. Is it to test perseverance or willingness to submit yourself to a rigorous education? Surely, a unique interest and self-pursuit of education solely in accounting and related material (say, the required courses outside of accounting, econ/marketing/etc.) would demonstrate that, no? Not to mention the ability to pass the CPA exams without the all-important college education. There is no other possibility that I can think of, so it would be great to hear from you. 

EDIT: In reflecting on this, it really seems like colleges have a monopoly on the perception of educational achievement, and that perception is obviously important as far as getting a job goes. Maybe a discussion for another thread, but any thoughts on that?

The problem is, they've offered me only only loans, and to attend would cost me more money than any other college I've applied and been accepted to, or will be accepted to. I know this is customary for most applicants, to not receive much, or any financial aid, really.
So please help me to justify this huge difference in cost! Especially in terms of the business school; I've heard that the network is unparalleled for engineering majors, but what makes it worth my money to attend the College of Business in terms of job placement, internships, things that Illinois will trump other places on?

My dream job is at Company A, but when I applied for a full-time position there, they only offered me a summer internship for 10 weeks. I accepted the offer because I think working there, even briefly, would be amazing. But I'm a little concerned. The guy who will be my manager told me that it's very unlikely that I could transition to a full-time position because they rarely hire (due to budget limitations -- they do a lot of government contracted work in the space industry). 

Meanwhile I've had phone screens at a few other companies who told me they're okay with me starting after Company A's internship. My concern is that a company other than Company A offers me a position before the summer and I have to accept it. And then later, Company A ends up offering me a position too. I would want to take Company A's offer, but I don't want to have to retract any other offers.

What's the best way to approach this? Should I apply for other jobs later in the summer so that I have a better idea of whether I'll get offered a position at Company A? Or should I just assume that I definitely won't get offered a position at Company A? Or is there something I could do to greatly increase my chances of an offer at Company A (besides just doing great work)?

So basically my questions are-

1. Is doing a masters forever out of the question?
2. What level of jobs should I be applying for?
3. An internship sounds like it would be the best way to get some experience, are they offered to those who have finished uni? and if so where should I look for them?

In addition to have NO idea how to do taxes, I do not have any idea how to get health insurance or plan for retirement.

Do I have to get a job to get these kinds of 'benefits'? What about dental? Can I get 'benefits' without having a job? How do I maintain benefits if I'm self-employed?

ret2s,1,2012-03-26,A question for those familiar with the IATSE Local 700 regarding unpaid internships?,Ryz0n,WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/ret2s/a_question_for_those_familiar_with_the_iatse/,"So I don't have any experience besides learning Pro Tools and Logic at home over the last few years, and am looking for an unpaid internship in LA. I talked to a family friend who is an accomplished foley mixer, and he couldn't help me other than referring me to the IATSE. He told me to contact them and to try to put myself on a roster or list where I offer to work for free and I guess if I got something out of this, this would contribute to the 30-day (or 100?) day requirement of work to apply to the Local 700.


I haven't been able to find the right number on their website to figure out what to do, so I'm seeing if anyone here knows what I'm talking about. Is there some kind of list or some database I can put my name into to try to find an internship? It's really less of an internship and me just trying to take the first step towards stepping into a professional environment and hopefully having some people that can be possible mentors to me. I'm interested in sound mixing/engineering in music and post. Does anyone have advice for what my first course of action should be?"

resmz,6,2012-03-26,What is it like to be a programmer/developer? I want to study Information Technology - In which field do you think i should deeper my knowledge?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/resmz/what_is_it_like_to_be_a_programmerdeveloper_i/,"Hello and thank you for taking your time helping me out :)

Iam 19, will have my *highschool-like* degree in a year which i have to complete with an 12-month internship in a field i'd like to study. I will finish this on the beginning of '14 so i'll have to take another 6 month internship for the blank time. I love mathematics so for this side iam save

A few months ago i started researching about programming and development and started my first programming experience ever with a few days of qbasic and then took on C++, additionally i peaked into the very basics of html/css. Though, I did not invest the time i want to(especially on the web part), because i had a somewhat stressful time due to personal matters and due to lack of friends with the same interests.

Thus, in about 2 1/2 years iam attending a college and am currently intrested in Information Technology with focus on the practical part(programming, software dev, algorithms). The colleges here tend to use Java for projects(still c/c++ for the beginner phase).

I later want to do something in one or more of the following: web- / app- development, software development, scienctific computing, open source(?), research, side projects like games or sth.(still a wide field)

So my questions are

* What is an average work and offwork day for you as a Programmer/Developer?

* Do you have time doing things not directly job related(while or off work)? - learning other useful things(eg more programming languages), Doing sports, thinking of other things, seeing the world and stuff like that.

* is PHP programming a save/fun field?

* under what circumstances, how long, how intensive and at which age did you start and are you happy with ***what*** you do and what you ***get*** now?

* Should i stick to C++ until iam in college or should I already swap to Java? Or is it better to focus on math first?

To the R/V Okeanos Explorer Staff,

There's an old capstan chantey that sings: ""There are three sorts of people; those who are alive, those who are dead, and those who are at sea."" While the advent of wireless technology has rescued many a seafaring folk from purgatory, going out to sea is still hardly anything short of an other-worldly experience. Current exploration technology is revealing the ocean to be less mysterious, though often it ends up revealing it as more enigmatic by the minute. 
The ocean is often referred to as ""inner space,"" the ""last terrestrial frontier,"" a place that many have never seen up close, let alone been under. The crushing forces of the deep ocean have prevented all but the Sylvia Earle's, Robert Ballard's, and as of last night, James Cameron's, of the world from up-close visitation. But, as time moves forward and the pixels get sharper, new insight for today's scientists, students, and popcorn-munching television audiences is provided through the exploration of the ocean's untouched corners. The question of ""if"" we will see the unknown has evolved into ""when"" will we find out what exactly lurks, or plainly sits, beneath the surface? The answer, of course, is right now, onboard the R/V Okeanos Explorer.

Exploration of the ocean isn't just for the sake of filming nature-channel TV specials. There may be untapped potential resources that a brilliant mind can use to improve the lives of all, be it economically, or technologically. Or perhaps lost histories will be found, be it sunken ships or the famed city of Atlantis. When searching the unknown for what is unknown, the possible findings could fill an infinitely long list. Regardless of expected finds, the more we know about what makes up our world, the more power we have to use new knowledge in the best ways possible. It is not uncommon when the unexpected outcome solves a problem more efficiently than an answer we attempted to discover could have.

In May I will be graduating from the University of Miami with an undergraduate degree in marine science and affairs. I've participated in a wide variety of research over my years in school, but by far my favorite type has been that undertaken miles away from any shoreline. I've sorted and counted a fair share of marine organisms, and fired a fair share of Niskin bottles as well. Even after all this time, I can't say with any honesty that I have a ""favorite"" field within the vast scope of marine science, only that the ocean is absolutely my favorite place to be. Any variety of work that brings me closer to unravelling its many mysteries is the kind of work I'd like to be doing.
An internship with the Okeanos Explorer will further enhance my understanding of science-in-action, and of course, any new information that I absorb while aboard will serve to expand my knowledge of the ocean and it's processes. At this moment, I am not attending graduate school, but I intend to in the future when I find a program that inspires me (and also funds me!). For now, I am pursuing employment as a science educator, which is a field I am also deeply passionate about. It is a goal of mine to be someone who can close the communicative gaps between scientists and the general public, and being that someone requires the ability to understand both the gears that turn good research into great results, and also those that turn great results into improved lifestyles. This internship will bring me into the heart of the empirical mechanism, and into the company of fellow ocean-lovers who have much to teach me about both the sea and about science itself.

I have experience on NOAA research vessels and so I am familiar with the protocols of working with NOAA scientists. It would excite me very much to earn an opportunity to work onboard the R/V Okeanos Explorer, and I look forward to hearing back from the program!

Thank you for this opportunity!"

[How sustainable do you think your career is?  How long do you think you'll do it?  If it's not a long-term career, what kind of job will you look for afterwards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44znhr?context=5)|This is my favorite question so far.
 |The truth is I don't want to be doing this forever...It started off as a way to make money in high school to have fun and it went through periods where it was way more intense.  Two times in particular - once when I was 19 and bringing a shit ton of hi quality cocaine from the ghetto of LA to a cozy suburb in norcal; the other was before the 80mg Oxycontin became illegal to produce in the form that could be smoked/snorted/shot up in college.
 |Sorry I got off track.  If its done right, it can sustain a very nice life.  But it's a lot of hectic, stressful work and of course the legal issue.  At the peaks I was making about 2.5-3.5x profit on my investment.  I.E invest $2000, get back 5-7k.
 |As I mentioned in the post details, I have a degree in marketing and looking for work in that or sales, hopefully for a start up tech company.
[How do you justify your career to yourself, ethically?  Doesn't it bother you that you might be helping to destroy someone's life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zs3y?context=5)|I am doing nothing different than any big pharmaceutical company, tobacco company, or liquor store - providing a product to interested clientele.  People who do drugs, you'd be surprised.  I've done blow with a lawyer and judge in LA who handled his shit every day and then some.  I've dealt oxy to a dopefiend who has the semi seizure from not having any dope recently enough.  There are levels of differences in users that I couldn't even begin to describe completely here.
[Why should i buy your drugs over the competitors? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zh0p?context=5)|Well currently I deal with pharmaceuticals, so the pills are all the same and there is not quality concerns.  With a street drug like cocaine, it often is a long and tenuous process to find a dealer who has the right price and right quality.  For me, the best times were the most random meet and greets that turned into something else.
[You get enough girls trading themselves for drugs?? Where do you hide your products?? like inside the drawers or up in the ceiling, or or ??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c4506an?context=5)|The few times I got a chick that way, I felt pretty shitty.  But yeah it happened a few times...
 |In a safe.
[What did you start dealing? Weed? Or were you like ""Fuck it, I'm selling coke."" from the start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zo72?context=5)|LOL. Weed yes, but I was so bad at it in high school, selling dime bags to the slackers at school.  Now I deal with pounds of it and having a much better time.
 |It was really more of whatever I could make money off of that people around me wanted/needed.  Filling a void, which as I grew up shifted from pot to bigger stuff.
[Have you ever found yourself in danger while dealing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zotn?context=5)|Yes.  I've had a gun pulled on me a couple times.  It's fucking frightening when the person holding is a dope fiend.
[What is the youngest client you have ever sold to? Have you ever refused to sell to anyone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c451e2q?context=5)|Honestly I don't associate with kids younger than 21 now because my lifestyle just doesn't mesh with them.  I suppose when I was in high school, at age 14, I sold some weed to another kid in high school, also age 14.  So yeah.
 |Yes, but it was because they were acting sketch and what not 
[How hard is it to get pharmaceuticals in a large enough quantity to distribute? Is it just a matter of knowing people who have prescriptions, or do you have to go through shadier avenues to get the pills?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c4508i4?context=5)|Depends largely on your situation.  If you have a legitimate medical issue than you just have to find the right doctor to prescribe the pills you want.  If you don't than you'll have to look elsewhere.  In some cities there are places on the street where you can find and buy drugs pretty easily. SF in particular comes to mind.
[HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE AND DO YOU NEED ANY INTERNS? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zgkp?context=5)|Currently about $2000 per month profit, that's after expenses and your investment into product.
[So you could risk ~10years jail time for a $24,000 a year job &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c4567wh?context=5)|It sounds so much worse when I read it.  In reality there is little chance that I'll have any problems with the law because I deal with a select few.
[You're risking pound-me-in-the-ass-prison for one and a half times California's minimum wage?  Genius.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c452zpu?context=5)|Yeah it sounds pretty bad when you say it like that.  
[That sounds like a really terrible payout considering the risk-reward. Couldn't you make far more money growing pot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c452hee?context=5)|Probably, but I don't have the place to grow it, the equipment to use, or the urge to spend my time tending to a bunch of plants.
[You didn't answer my intern question.... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zivl?context=5)|Come on now.
[Ask 2/3 of the people arrested for intent to distribute and I bet they all felt the same way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c457k1z?context=5)|I've been doing this long enough to do it right.
[I have a degree in marketing, iv delt with guys who work for companys like Jaguar automotive who are pretty high up in marketing and let me tell you .... they dont earn a lot at all. Its a fun job, if you want to make money stay away from marketing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c452eyk?context=5)|Technically my degree is in Communication.
 |I'm looking to do more sales than marketing, for a tech company...a startup.  They earn plenty.
[I agree with ChiTown. I know people who casually deal pot when they need the money and they can usually get around 2-3k in a couple weeks. You must be mega small time or you're selling your drugs way too cheap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c450zda?context=5)|Yes probably.  I'm glad you know people, probably helps with the douchery you're exhibiting.
[Is it anything like Breaking Bad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zuzw?context=5)|Ah..I've never actually watched Breaking Bad...I know...I'm slacking right? 
[Thanks for the AMA. A couple of questions: Does your family know what you do? Do they approve? How does your work affect your personal/romantic life? Ever had any close calls with law enforcement? What are some ways that you spot potentially sketchy/suspicious situations (undercovers, hold-ups, etc)? Thanks again.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c4501y1?context=5)|No they don't, if they did they would wonder why I am wasting my talents selling this bullshit, as I do from time to time.
 |Yes many close calls with law enforcement to describe here, but if you have something more specific I'll try to answer that.
 |I am usually pretty good with people and noticing inconsistencies with current action vs previous actions.  Never dealt with an undercover before.
[How do you manage to fly under the radar? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zh8w?context=5)|At first it was harder and my actions were more visible to authorities, but you learn to adjust and behave after enough bad things happen to you.  Second, I deal with people I know and trust. If I ever have a bad feeling about a deal or someone is acting weird, then I don't deal with them.
[So you have gotten caught before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zlmh?context=5)|Not for drug dealing or drug possession, no.  other things though.
[You actually let your girlfriend take the fall for your drugs in her purse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c452ahn?context=5)|Sure as fuck did.
[What's the difference between the two different strains of heroin that you mentioned? and how would you describe the heroin rush/high/come down? thanks in advance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c450a3w?context=5)|Price, quality and availability.  Black tar is popular and available in CA, but its quality usually sucks unless you know someone special.  China is far superior, and can be snorted in addition to smoking and shooting it since its a light brown powder vs a dark black gooey shit substance that is tar.
 |Umm its great, except for the fact that its terrible.  If that doesn't make sense to you than it means you probably haven't done it, which I would then recommend that you never fucking do.
[How important is the suburban, white male, age 14-17 demographic to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zm8t?context=5)|Meaningless once I left for college(age 20).  That was the last time I had contact with any people at the high school I went to.
[What, in your opinion, is the sketchiest drug to sell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zt8y?context=5)|Opiates - oxy, heroin, percocet...that whole family.  
[How is this sketchier than cocaine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c450qcf?context=5)|Cocaine is sketchy to buy, but heroin/opiates create true dope fiends...crazy crazy breed of people.  maybe like people have depicted zombies...just not themselves, willing to do worse shit with less remorse.
[Lol come down to Florida where they go for $15-20 a pop, you'll see some real basers then.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c451w4l?context=5)|Those kind of idiots are everywhere....
[What's your average mark-up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c44zqj1?context=5)|Again it depends on the product.
 |Pot doesn't have a mark-up like other stuff.  It's usually just a commission on a sale.
 |Coke - 250-350% profit Oxy - 500% profit.
[After reading this comment and the other comment posted about you making 2000k a month in profit, it's apparent that you don't sell many drugs (or at least much volume). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c456vw5?context=5)|Yes, that number was kind of an estimate.  As you may know, the drug market is volatile and can change rapidly.  Also, demand wanes in and out. 30mg Roxicodone sells for 12-25 (wholesale-retail). (200Q per month) a 10mg Norco sells for 2-5 (wholesale-retail). (240Q per month) The roxies sell the quickest, but thats because there are more dopefiends for that shit.

[What sort of volume is purchased from each customer?  Do they typically buy as much as they can afford or do they rationalize their usage - purchasing the drug in servings or doses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c45760v?context=5)|Do you mean what kind of volume does each customer purchase?  I don't purchase volume from customers...
 |The answer is it varies.  Some buy for personal use, which for a drug user is usually 2-5 roxis per phone call.  They usually (because of their situation) don't have a whole like a capital lying around and are given money incrementally throughout the week, which they spend on drugs obviously.
 |The better clients buy many either because they can afford it one way or another or because they are reselling for profit or to offset their own addiction.
[Wouldn't it be a combination of both?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c4500oi?context=5)|Yes.

[How do your transactions usually go down? Do you sell from your own place, bring it to others, sell from your car, etc. ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c4513ke?context=5)|Ah. This is my last answer for the night.  I usually bring it to others.  They are more relaxed than you might think from some of the preconceptions about this kind of business.  You have to constantly be on your toes when doing a deal...anything can happen. Sometimes you have to take the loss if you get jacked.  Shit happens, but maybe only 5-10% of the time.
[You get jacked 5-10% of the time? Am I reading this right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c452b8o?context=5)|No I didn't say I get jacked 5-10% of the time...I'm saying for every 10 deals maybe one of them doesn't go so smoothly, which doesn't mean it ends badly, it just means it doesn't end the way you planned it.  I drove 3 hours to check out a 10 pack of weed (10 lbs) and it wasn't what I thought it would be/was sold to me as, so I left empty handed and with my money in my possession.
[How do you feel about drug dealing in popular culture? I'm talking about rappers like Jay-Z bragging about how they used to deal crack, how much of this do you believe?

I don't really like listening to that shit anymore though.  I believe very little of it because I've met kids who rap about that shit but don't live it themselves.  Just because I deal drugs doesn't mean I can rap about it....so I think the people that can are inspired by people who do and often tell their friends stories...just a thought.
 |I like movies about drug crime too.  Pretty interesting stuff usually...I like 25th Hour with Edward Norton.  Probably the ""realest"" thing I've seen that I can recall right now.

Why would I get audited? There would have to be a reason because my taxes are in order 100%.  No problem, I enjoyed answering your questions.  I thought maybe more people would appreciate having access to someone with an insight into the fucked up world of drug dealing.  I did this to educate, not to gain more customers or corrupt new people....If I could do it all over again I would not have gotten as deep as quickly during college.

I have a credit card and a credit score like every other American middle classer.  It is not ""sketchy"" to buy a car with cash, maybe at the dealer, but on craigslist everyone wants cash so its kind of overlooked.

Some dealers and some users are more impersonal than others.  Unless I like the person I'm dealing with and can stand to be around them (many users/dealers are incredibly annoying and will easily get on an average person's nerves)

That makes it much easier when the drugs are actually in my possession because I don't have to make the choice of whether I want to use or not.
[So, the medication makes it that even if you were to use an opiate, you wouldn't feel high, making you not even bother wanting to use anymore?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c4565uk?context=5)|Right. After taken the suboxone (sublingually) you could shoot a gram of heroin and not get high.

[What is your view on legalization of weed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c452pny?context=5)|Should be non-criminalized.  Legalization carries the implications of regulation, which as seen in Prop 19 here in CA can be used by big corporations to try to subvert the system that seems to work for most people.  I've always thought that if a big corporation gets involved then the availability of mid grade would be plentiful and cheap, while high grade would go even higher than it is now.   This is because the corporations would require regulations similar to organic farmers who can't afford the ""certified organic"" label, even though they clearly grow organically.  Many growers are small time and deal with a select few.
[How much do you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rdr16/iama_a_college_educated_drug_dealer_in_california/c453u6y?context=5)|Not enough, but I posted the answer already somewhere in the thread.

re8h1,47,2012-03-26,Remember that UI overhaul someone posted here a while back? Well here's a message to DICE's marketing department in regards to that.,[deleted],battlefield3,https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/re8h1/remember_that_ui_overhaul_someone_posted_here_a/,"I think it is pretty clear that DICE has been taking a lot of heat in the past few months for a various number things that their fanbase has called for (much wanted features, faster patching support, etc.). You know what would be an ingenious PR move on DICE's part? Find that guy who created the PC UI overhaul and hire him as a temporary intern. Implement whatever is possible from that UI overhaul into the actual game. I think the general consensus is that the changes he proposed are without a doubt upgrades over everything we currently have. Make it a big announcement for the community to see, and if the guy generally does good work, give him a conditional offer for full-time employment. This is all assuming the guy/girl is over 18 and legally able to work, etc. etc. This would show that DICE really does listen to the community and will urge more people to apply their creativity/design skills to the BF franchise. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Demize99 state that one of the big reasons he got the job with DICE is because of his knowledge and experience with creating mods in past BF games? Thoughts?



**EDIT: It has been made clear to me that implementing his UI concept into the current game would be such a huge undertaking that it is more than likely not possible.  I am aware of this, but I guess my main point here was that if DICE were to ever use his concept, (or any fan concept/idea for that matter), make it known to the community; that way it will encourage creative community feedback for future games.**

I'm a senior in college and I've never been able to get hired for any sort of real position or internship. I only worked one job at a movie theater.

I work exceptionally hard on my school work, I've always taken challenging classes. I am excellent for my age in nearly every level of computers, it hardly even matters what I'm majoring in (database/programming type stuff) because I'm just as good everywhere else.

I take a lot of business classes: Group projects, speeches, and written essays. I am very talented in all of these. I don't have exactly the awkward personality a lot of my computer colleagues have yet I still have their skills.

I can't find any real way to convey this other than, to put in toddler words ""I did good in... Computers. I did good in... Business classes. I work hard"" (obviously I describe it a little better, but it doesn't show how superior I am to the average person)


I don't do any clubs or anything though. That is one area I suck at. But for good reason: I spend most of my free time studying psychoanalysis which I use as my own sort of counseling volunteer position. It's not technically official though, but I do have a bunch of diverse contacts who are 100% there to tell me how much I've changed their lives. It is a very large ""hobby"" of mine, complete with databases and actual ""sciency"" stuff. Can I market that somehow? 

I just don't know what to do; I apply to a bunch of jobs which is frustrating because they take like literally an hour each to go through their stupid website and filling out the information. Then I get an auto-rejected email or if I even make it to an interview, there's some asshole nuclear scientist who's applying for the level 1 internship position that gets the job instead of me and I end up with absolutely nothing to do all summer for work, and no money to do anything to build work skills.

My question: how would a transfer student usually give out their GPA?

I did pretty shitty my first couple of semesters here, and as a result there's about a 1-point difference in GPA between the two schools. (prev school is 3.x, current school is 2.x) Therefore, it would be to my advantage to give out the ""cumulative"" one (average from all courses completed), rather than the one at my present school.

Would it be deceptive to do this? My resume makes it clear that I have attended both schools, although it doesn't have the GPA listed. However, there will probably be situations where they do ask for my GPA, and maybe want a transcript.

For what it's worth, my current institution has a better reputation than the one I went to before (especially in my major), and it doesn't count transfer credits in its GPA. If I needed a transcript, the school I attend now would print all the grades from both schools, but only include its own classes in the printed GPA. I could also send a transcript from my previous institution as well.

And of course I intend to improve my GPA, but will be applying for internships for the time being.

Thanks!"

**SUPER,*tl:dr* at the bottom bottom.**

Blog post:
http://how-to-buy-tramadol.blogspot.com

**Basic Overview: There are a few services I know of (mentioned in the Text). But I clearly recommend [dokteronline.com](http://de.dokteronline.com/1348/coupon/2D232C77/) because of my own experience, and it's the only online doc who treats pain (Tramadol) - clicking the link grants you a 5€ discount, ""story"" behind that also in the text**


Please excuse the wall of text, especially with my possibly bad foreigner english. But I think that all the additional information are pretty important for most of you. I've used illegal ""pharmacies"" for a long time, and many people still do. That's why I think it's important to share this information. Another intention is to spread awareness to the possibilities to force a change in the healthcare system to integrate the possibilities the internet gives us. The german healthcare system wastes billions on a system that encourages people to go to see a doc for every little sneeze. Of course pharmacists and the HUGE pharma industry tries to smash this developement in online foreign online pharmacies and especially foreign prescriptions with meds from foreign countries.

One thing first. As the title implies, the serivce is only available (law based restrictions) in countries within the European Union. US customers have other (mostly illegal), but very reliable services, which make things like this mostly obsolete (of course, the difference is the reliability and security). Again: **NOT FOR US CUSTOMERS**

All in all it's a pretty unknown way to get prescription drugs, without having to worry about shit like customs, quality and potential scammers. There are only few players in this business, because the monitoring, limitations and requirements (specially registered pharmacies afaik etc.) are much higher than in traditional pharmacies and docs. There are only few services I know,: the german ""Dr. ED"", which is pretty new, ""dokteronline"" (on the market forever), and a UK only service (forgot the name). Online prescriptions are legal in the UK and netherlands as far as I know. But as the title already states, it's a limited to certain treatments. Which means: No scheduled drugs (Benzodiazepines like Valium, Xanax etc., and no drugs where this kind of consultation is impossible and dangerous (Mental Illnesses). Of course, that whole thing is still pretty debateable, but as a responsible customer I know my shit. 

Now the the tings possible to order are things like Tramadol (which is unique of all the similar services, maybe dutch laws are different), all kinds of ED drugs (Viagra, Cialis), Hairloss meds (Propecia), Smoking (Zyban, which could by the way be used as an AD, but whatever), Treatment for Acne, The Pill, for STDs, FLU... etc. you get the drill.

www.dred.de (german docs operating from the UK) was featured in the german press (and pharmacy intern press) as completely legit, but spiced up with the obvious lobbying from pharma giants). (Oh and Btw. There is a german blog about the whole topic: http://tramadol-viagra-legal-bestellen.blogspot.de/ for the german speaking redditors) Customs in germany are propably the most fucked up on the entire planet, you can't even order vitamin pills from non EU states. Big thanks to all the pharma giants to remember our politicians to protect the citizens from dangerous, and cheeper supplements and drugs (fun fact for cpt. obvious: germany has by far the highest drug prices).

I've always used dokteronline (based in the netherlands) for several reasons, but the most important: Their huge product pallette and the pharmacy they are affiliated with, which uses UPS Express for every order. And that's insane. One of the most mind blowing things ever: 1.) place order, 2.) order gets approved, 3.) prescription gets send to pharmacy the same day 4. order gets on it's way at 6pm (according to tracking) 4.) arrives the next day before 12am in fucking germany. FUCKING UPS HOW DO THEY WORK?

Besides the limitations in products, the docs there are real physicians. You need a believable illnes and can't combine it with incompatible medicaments etc. There is also a limitation on (monthly) quantity (cheating with different accounts doesn't work). Especially Tramadol orders can get rejected due to lack of information, and physiotherapy or are (pretty rarely) followed by questions to your state of treatment and additional reccomendations.

Their customer service is pretty awesome and fast, I even had to call once and was suprised about the awesomeness (so if you have issues with something and are scared of being scammed or something just call them - as long as your language is available on the site the number in the mails and on the page redirects to the  service in your native language (as everything else, even the physicians - in germany at least, the german doc is dutch, his german in the occasional message is not flawless. Can't garuantee it for all the other ones (besides english of course)).

I've ordered there for years, and followed their development to a pretty big company and had every thinkable issue and question. So feel free to ask. I hope the wider knowledge of pharmacies like this will start to spawn new and similar services to fuel some more competition. Again: They aren't operating in a greyzone, it's legally backed and people within the EU but outside of where these laws got introduced (UK and the Netherland) benefit from EU laws and free borders. FeelsGoodMan.jpg

I've never tried Dr.Ed, they seem to be really transparent and look more like a serious business (compared to the DO site, but trust me, it was so much worse 4 years ago)

Important thing to know: I know that many countries don't use credit cards as much as normal debit cards. EU bank transfer laws have changed! The so called SEPA bank transfer now takes as much time as a national bank transfer. My experience with it is ONE day (compared to about 1 week, before the reform). I don't know if Giropay is a germany only service, but it allows to transfer money immediatly with a debit card (online banking necessary). The order won't get to the phycisian if they haven't received the payment. After that you can get regular status updates and even the tracking number if it's finally shipped. (That thing with the over night black wizardry delivery, remember to keep some garlic or holy water by yourself, when the post man rings the bell.)

Another thing: I've recieved a 5€ discount code ages ago per mail and it still works with every order (I've bookmarked it). After clicking it, the ammount will automatically be added to the shopping cart, so I guess cookies must be enabled. [http://de.dokteronline.com/1348/coupon/2D232C77/](http://de.dokteronline.com/1348/coupon/2D232C77/) (I only have the german link, but it's no problem to change the language, the discount will still work)

Oh and: The prices of the meds itself seem to be pretty low. You have to remember that you have to add about 30€ of handling fees (shipping, receipt etc.).

For those who order Tramadol: Zydol is the international brandname for Tramadol of Gruenthal (The guys that invented tramadol), prices often change, but the best for tabs with sustained release I recommend the Gruenenthal Zydol, and for non SR those under ""Tramadol"" (SR-sutained release).

**TL;DR: (sorry it's longer but some things are nessecary)**


*-only few competitors in this area, due to high restrictions and higher liability for the phycisians and affiliated pharmacies.

-Online consultations are legal in UK and Netherlands, EU laws make it possible to legally use this service even if your local law doesn't allow that. 

-No problems with customs due to this awesome Union.

-You get 100% real brand medicines from a registered pharmacy. Including intake instructions labled on them and a barcode to track them. (If you are really that mistrustful.)

-dokteronline is the longest most experienced player in the market with the biggest product pallette (especially the tramadol is cheaper than the illegal alternatives. Also: See trustpilot reviews 5/5, I've ordered there for years, never tested the other ones, because it's not needed.

-[Ancient 5€ Coupon here: Dokteronline 5€ Coupon](http://de.dokteronline.com/1348/coupon/2D232C77/) (get's added automatically, cookies must be enabled) - doesn't seem to expire, got it per mail ages ago and can be used multiple times, can be bookmarked. Because that's how I got the link (ger), chamging the language doesn't affect the discount, 

-You need a believable illness, there are indeed real docs behind the screen. Sometimes asking questions.

-UPS Express (Over Night) express with every order from biggest online Pharmacy in Europe (Pharmacy2U)

-The service is excellent, if something goes wrong, just call and they'll help (if your native language is available, the phonenumber changes and automatically redirects you to the corresponding operator)

-if you have doubts or other questions feel free to ask. I've used their service since 2006.*

I'm new to Reddit but here's my situation. I'm a college freshman majoring in Biology and I'm interested in interning for the SCA this coming summer. I'm not really looking for anything beyond the summer though. Just an internship that let's me explore my interests and that will look good on resumes and such. Making money would obviously be awesome but is not really necessary at this point. I'm eligible for their ""Internship"" and ""Community"" programs and was just wondering if any of you have worked with the SCA and what you guys think of the program. Was it a good experience? How difficult is the application/selection process? Any advice/recommendations in terms of what they look for and how to go about this whole process? Thanks a ton."

I know this isnt about trees, but I figure fellow ents might be able to help me out.


Hey there! I am a 17 year old american, looking to do 2 years of university here, and then transfer to a school in NZ. It seems so peaceful, and less stressful than the US. I am going there over summer, to see how I like it. So far, from what I can gather, it seems much less stressful. I just have a few questions...

1.) How are Americans treated? Will they hate my guts just becuase I am american?

2.) Do a lot of people pick up kiwi accent quickly? I dont want it being obvious I am american

3.) I know jobs are difficult to obtain there right now. I was considering starting a bearded dragon farm (I have been breedin bearded dragons for years), so how expensive is land there? But I am going to school for business, so my main question is: do business majors there get jobs often?

I think that is basically it. If you have any recommendations for me, or places to visit while I am there, Please let me know. 

This all depends on whether or not I get a job coming up. I have an interview for a 4 year paid CIA internship, so my move to NZ will depend on if anything comes from that job."

I’ve washed my sheets a few times since, cleaned up, thrown the sweater you left behind on the curb. I don’t remember too much from our last evening together, only the few words you hissed between the moans and tears: You shouldn’t let your fear overcome you like this. 

The morning after, while you told me how your grandfather had recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and how he wanted to end his life with dignity, and how much you respected him for that, after the nostalgic anecdotes of your childhood, and your diatribe against the Felix Gonzales-Torres exhibit we’d seen together a week before, as you were smoking your second cigarette with your free hand around my waist and your lips buried in my hair so your confessions cascaded on my head in warm breaths, I killed you a thousand times. I skinned you slowly, drowned you, boiled you, burnt and buried you. 

You finally left at twelve for your internship at Tufts medical center, sporting that Adam Lippes Jersey Pea Coat you were so proud of, grinning as you slipped out the door, the kiss you planted so casually still burning on my forehead. I sat alone for a few hours after that. Not doing much. Not thinking much. Later that night I began my paper on Hobbes. Life sort of went on. Sort of.

Weeks passed flatly. Slowly the glaring fact of your innocence unfurled- you didn’t know, not really. I should have said something. I should have answered the calls and listened to the voicemails. For your sake. For mine. I’m sorry. I just didn’t have the capacity.

rde04,1,2012-03-25,Boyfriend doesn't want to stay with me for the summer. What does it mean?,vegetablesoup,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/rde04/boyfriend_doesnt_want_to_stay_with_me_for_the/,"First I'll start with a little background. My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year. We're in our early twenties and still in school, but we're 18 hours away by car. We used to live closer to each other, lost contact for a while, then reconnected and decided to be in a long distance relationship. He has visited me twice and I've visited him twice. We talk almost every night on skype and I thought things were going well.

This is the problem. My boyfriend has one online class he can take during the summer semester so he doesn't have to live at school. I want him to stay with me for the summer. When I presented the idea to him, he said he'd probably visit for a week or two, then go back to his parents' house. He said he might look at a listing for an internship near where I live that I sent him a week ago. I asked him why he didn't want to stay the whole summer and he changed the subject. Keep in mind, his parents have a house they normally don't stay in, so he may just want a summer of privacy since he's a really introverted person.

Is this something I should be reading into? If I had the chance, I'd live with him in a second. It's upsetting he doesn't feel the same way. If he doesn't want to live with me for just a summer, I don't think he'd want to after I finish school when I was planning on moving closer to him. This puts me in a position where I'd be afraid of committing to anything with him. I'm already a bit upset I took time off of work and spent hundreds of dollars on plane tickets for a guy who turns this sort of thing down.

Am I pulling a crazy, /r/relationship_advice? Is this something you'd be upset about? Do you think he wants to break up with me?"

rghrs,27,2012-03-27,Can you get an internship as a freshman in college: A Guide,LockeWatts,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rghrs/can_you_get_an_internship_as_a_freshman_in/,"**Introduction:**  

Hi, I’m Locke. I’ve seen this question posted ~20 times, including once by myself, to /r/cscareerquestions over the last 6 months or so. As I have just gone through the entire process, I’m here to guide you along the way and answer questions about your wonderful exciting summer of sitting inside for 40 hours a week.  

**The answer (If you just want to know):**  

Possibly, but probably not. In a nut shell, this is just the truth of the matter. Read the actual guide if you want to know why.  

**The Story (My journey towards a summer internship):**  
If you don’t actually want to read about me, I’ll try to parse out the relevant bits into a summary at the bottom, but I find this kind of thing much easier to explain in context.  

I am a freshman at the University of Georgia, which unless you follow SEC football, you’ve probably never heard of. It’s a large research University located in Athens, GA. Our primary research is in binge drinking, but we’re also known for our biology and medical research, and occasionally something fun in our very small CS department (~200 students). I’m in the Honors program, pursuing a Bachelor’s\Master’s crossover, to get both degrees in four years. (Hooray for 37 hours of AP credit!)  

 I started my search early, in early October, looking everywhere I possibly could for internships. I crawled through all of my favorite big tech companies (Microsoft, Google, Apple, etc. etc.) and found a few promising gems. First, is the [Google Freshman Engineering Practicum]( http://www.google.com/jobs/engpracticum/fep/), which is exactly what it sounds like. A 10 week internship out in Mountain View, CA. Next was  the [Explore Microsoft](http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/internships-explore-microsoft.aspx) program, which similarly was a 12 week internship in Redmond, WA. Well now I was all excited, between these two tech giants, and the fact that I’m very smart, there’s gotta be something cool there right? Well, we’ll see.  

From there, I looked for whatever resources I could. I leaned on my parents, aunts, and uncles to possibly find me internships at their companies, or with the companies of friends. I sat down and crawled through hundreds of job postings on sites like [Dice](http://www.dice.com) and [Monster](http://www.monster.com) looking for internship postings in my area. Don’t look outside your area, unless they’re a big tech company (See above), they won’t pay for you to relocate for the summer.  

I found some decent success through these sites, and sent out [resumes](http://i41.tinypic.com/69dsi9.jpg) to everyone. Note, the translation to a .jpg in that got a little weird. Please give employers your resume in pdf format. Also, complete props to a post a few months ago that I shamelessly stole this resume format from.  

From there, I turned to my last two avenues of discovery. These are the ones that I’m going to have the least to tell you about, as they’re specific to your university. Your University’s career fair, and your University’s job website. I checked my career fair, and looked for CS companies. Well, we don’t have any. Shit. What about large companies that have big IT departments? Well, there are a fair number of those. So I got in my suit (You MUST wear a suit to a career fair) and went and talked to one or two of them.  

And finally, my University’s job site.  This was a gold mine for me. You could narrow it down to major, type of job (Internship versus full time) and then just mass email resumes.  

So first thing, fellow programmer, to do is to do everything I just listed above. This will take you a while. And then once you do it, you’ll have to do it again. As a general rule, I checked the University job site once every few days, from October until now. That’s important, because new jobs get submitted as time goes on. I had personally thought the recruiting process started in the fall, but from what I’ve seen it actually picks up in the spring.  

Oh! I just remembered. Here’s something unscrupulous I’ve done. If around where you live has a big tech school that you don’t go to, piggy back on their recruiting process. It’s probably open to anyone online. For example, I used Georgia Tech’s website to look as well as my own.  

Okay, so. After I did all that, I had the following list of companies that I had submitted some kind of literature to:  

- Google  
- Microsoft  
- IBM  
- AT&amp;T  
- HP  
- Chick-Fil-A  
- Home Depot  
- Lockheed Martin  
- ThyssenKrupp IT Services, North America  
- Verizon Wireless  
- McKesson Provider Technologies  
- ADP (Automatic Data Processing)  
- Sybase  
- Windham Brannon  
- Macy’s  
- MedAssets  

Don’t be surprised if you don’t recognize every name on the list, I submitted a resume to literally every company within driving distance of my house. Here’s the response I got back from them all.  

- Google: No  
- Microsoft: No  
- IBM: No  
- AT&amp;T: Originally no, and then I got a call from a random HR manager in March  
- *HP: Phone interview*  
- Chick-Fil-A: No  
- *Home Depot: Phone interview*  
- Lockheed Martin: No  
- *ThyssenKrupp IT Services: Phone interview, in person interview*  
- Verizon Wireless: No  
- McKesson: No  
- ADP: No  
- *Sybase: Phone interview*  
- Windham Brannon: No  
- Macy’s: No  
- *MedAssets: Phone interview, in person interview*  

So, yeah. Lesson here is learn to accept rejection, you’ll get it a lot. Of the companies who responded to me (Which was only about half of the “no”s, the rest didn’t even bother), most said that they weren’t interested in a freshman intern. Doesn’t matter my skill set or programming ability, they simply aren’t interested.  

The reason the companies gave me for this is that most companies use their internships as recruitment programs. Nobody is thinking four years down the road as far as hiring new recruits. They want new developers after the summer you work for them. This fucking sucks, but is the truth of the matter.  

Now, as for the interview process itself. I won’t say I’m an expert on interviews. But I did go through 6 interviews of one sort or another for an internship, so I’ll fill you in on my experiences.  

As a general note of things that were covered in every interview so I don’t repeat myself:  

*General questions:*  

- Tell me about yourself. – This question sucks. I’m sorry, it just does. I would generally respond “That’s a rather broad question, do you mean academically, programmatically, personally…? I’m not really sure what you’re looking for.” Until I realized that they always meant programmatically. Tell them about your programming background. Mine went something like this:  

“Okay, I’m a 1st year at UGA in the Honors program, doing an accelerated Bachelor’s Master’s program to get both degrees in four years. I began programming when I was 12 doing basic scripting stuff relating to IRC chat rooms (Editor’s Note: Yes, I know that the C stands for “chat”. They generally don’t.), and then from there branched out into basic JavaScript and began being interested in computer security. From there beginning just before high school I branched out into Java and C++ to learn more object oriented programming, and began working on larger projects. Since then I’ve been working on becoming familiar with Python, C#, and Ruby.""  
 
Invariably, this leads to the next question which I know all of you don’t like:  

- Tell me about a project you’ve worked on in the past that you were particularly excited about doing.  

I’ll be honest right here. I have past projects to draw on. If you don’t, make it up. That is probably unethical, but if you can talk about a project like you have worked on it, even if it never got out of the design stages, it still shows the level of interest they’re looking for.  

Anyway, my answer would either be “Oh well I’m excited about the Android app I’m working on right now” or “Well I made this bot to sit in chat rooms in middle school that ended up being by number of lines by far my biggest project” and then I would elaborate.  

This is an important question. Not only will they gauge your programming ability by the depth of the project you worked on, but they’ll gauge your interest in programming in general and the work they do. If you can figure out what they do ahead of time and tailor your story to make it seem like you really like their work, all the better.  

Technical Questions:  

- The definition of inheritance - Every, single, interview. Both phone and in person. I found this easiest to elaborate by saying the definition, and then giving an example.  
- The definition of polymorphism – See above  
- Some keyword question (For HP it was C#’s “protected”, for MedAssets it was C++'s “struct”, etc). Know your terminology.   
- Some kind of database question (How do you sanitize SQL inputs, what are the advantages\disadvantages of using this kind of database, etc.)  
- Some kind of data structure question. Not the same as above. This would be like, tell me why you would use an array over a linked list, and vica versa.   

In interviews in general, you need to be relaxed. I know this can be hard, especially if you’ve never interviewed before. My general advice here would be to talk to other people about programming. Talk to people who know more than you. Talk to a professor, a grad student, a senior who's about to work at Google or whatever. Find someone, and just talk to them about code. The interview will more or less be no different.  

Surprisingly, in all of the interviews I only got asked a few actual programming questions where I had to write code. They didn’t want syntax perfect, but they wanted it to be more refined than pseudo code. I know everyone hates this, but I have to do it for tests too. It’s best to just memorize your basic syntax. The questions I had to do by hand were the following:  

- Here is a 12X12 multiplication table. Write a program to output this table.  
- Modify the program above to work with any size table.  
- Modify the problem above so that if the number is divisible by three, output “fizz” instead of the number, and if the number is divisible by five, output “buzz”. (This is the classic fizzbuzz problem).  
- Write a program to take in a string and reverse it.  
- Let’s say I have an arbitrarily large linked list. What would you do to check if someone had looped the list back on itself (Pointed one of the pointers to an earlier node).    

All of these except the last one shouldn’t be particularly challenging to a second semester CS student. I was honestly very surprised with how easy the programming challenges were.  

From there, you’ll either get a call saying we would like you to come on or we wouldn’t. To conclude my story, I did get an internship! I won’t say with who in case one of you wants to stalk me, but I’m very pleased with it.  

**Miscellaneous information you might want to know:**

- In my research into internships, I got a decent grasp of what interns get paid. In New York and California the internships I looked at were at $30/hour. Around here in Atlanta, I’m getting paid $15/hour, and another one I tried to get was $18/hour. So, definitely good money, and scales based on where you live.  

- The big tech companies are the only ones who pay for relocation, so look for something in your area. Nevertheless, it’s awesome they do that.  

- Internships are generally between eight and twelve weeks, depending on where they are, and not particularly accommodating to your schedule. I’ll end up only working about 3/4ths of my summer right now, due to when their internship block of the summer is. Oh well.  

And that’s all I got! If you have any other questions or if I’ve left out something big from this guide, please either post here or PM me! I’m happy to share whatever knowledge I have.

rg6su,1,2012-03-27,My weekend from hell.,JackOhBee,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/rg6su/my_weekend_from_hell/,"Reddit, this will be long and rambley. You have been warned.


I have been with my girlfriend for nearly 2 years, we met last summer and hit it off right away. Within 2 weeks of meeting I pretty much moved in with her for the rest of the summer, and it was the best time in my life hands down. We have two completely different views on the world and have completely different beliefs. I am a left winged, stoner and atheist while she is very religious, right winged anti weed girl. We didn't care, we loved each other for who we are and our differences have never triggered fights but thought out conversations. At the end that first summer was our first major challenge, she was going back to school which was a 4 hour drive away. We were both scared that it wouldn't work, that we would grow apart, find someone else or even just forget about each other. That wasn't the case, we made it work and it worked out great, we would skype every night and once a month one of us would make the drive to see each other. By the time summer came again everything was amazing, she even got an internship in town so she was here from May until January.


This is when everything started going wrong. As a graduation gift her family was sending her on a 6 week back packing trip to Europe where should would be traveling by her self for the entire time. Her parents told her to book everything and they would pay for it all. During the coarse of the 7 months she was here for her internship she would go on and on every day about how I have no idea how excited she was for this trip, even when she was dropping me off at the airport to visit Disneyland for the first time in my life, she told me I have no how excited she was for ""the vacation I've dreamed of my entire life."" Now I know you guys have no idea who the hell I am but I'm 24 years old and my entire life I've dreamed of going to Disneyland and riding the Matterhorn. 

Christmas comes and she books her plane tickets for the Europe trip. She graduates school 4/28 and her flight is leaving 5/1. I would only have 1 full day with her before she would leave for 6 weeks. Wanna know what makes this better? My birthday is 5/12. We've been together long enough at this point for her to keep that in mind when booking the reservation. Her flight home would be landing at 8PM on our anniversary too. Not only am I going to be alone on my birthday, but I'm really not going to see here to celebrate our anniversary.

THE PLOT THICKENS, just before she leaves for school again she tells me that she was been accepted to teach English in Spain for 9 months, meaning she would miss the following birthday too. She claims that its been her life dream to do this, even though when we started dated her life goal was to move to Washington DC to work for the government. I told her that I didn't want to go but I would support her no matter what she chooses. I was worried that being that far away for that long that she would meet someone, either start a relationship or even just a one night stand. I know how paranoid I sound with that but I don't think its out of line to have those fears.

This is where the weekend from hell begins. It's Valentines Day week and I'm driving up to see her on the 15th. (I'm the guest services supervisor for a major hotel and getting vday off was impossible.) I was up all night working on making her that melting crayon thingy that was all over the front page of reddit that week, stressing because it wasn't working out and I didn't want to show up empty handed. I got to WalMart and spend over $50 on Vday swag (at 70% off mind you) so I can have something for her. The moment I get into town my car dies. Dies. As in the mother aint coming back. She picks me up from where I was and we enjoy our evening together. The next day she had class so I stayed at her place until she was done. While I was alone I played around with her iPad and found emails that she had been sending to some guy. She made plans to meet up with him and even ended one email with ""I'll buy condoms on the way so we don't have to use yours."" This was sent before Xmas, when she was staying in MY house. These emails when on for a few months and she even said in one emails ""I feel guilty even though I shouldn't because we are both clearly attracted to each other."" I confronted her right away when she got home and the nasty fight that you can imagine came about. She claims that nothing happened and I did find that to be genuine. She sobbed and begged at my feet for a hour to forgive her, that I was the love of her life and she fucked up and didn't want to loose me. 

All I wanted to do was get away, be alone and process everything that had happened. But i couldn't. My car was dead in the shop, and it wouldn't be ready for 5 days. This is college housing, she had no couch for me to even sleep on. I never got a moment alone, not to cry, not to think, not to be angry at the world. She was always there apologizing non-stop the entire weekend. I shut down and went into autopilot in a way I never have before. I just went on almost as if nothing ever happened. We fucked, went out to dinner, and even at the Vday chocolates I bought her. I thought maybe my car dying was a sign from the universe that we were going to be ok and grow from this, become a stronger couple then we were before. I didn't want us to end, but once I got the phone call that my car was ready I knew it was over. I knew that would be the last time I would kiss her goodbye. I didn't want it to be but I knew deep down that it was over. We didn't break up, we tried to work it out. Spring break was a week and a half later and she was going to be back in my town. We made plans to meet at Disney World, but the night before she said she forgot and made plans with her friend to go to the parks. I meet up with them in the park and the moment I saw her I felt nothing. I was empty and hallow, I couldn't even go into my autopilot bullshit self to get through the day. I couldn't take it any more and ended up breaking up with her in the parking lot in front of her best friend.

I was a wreck for weeks and I'm still not my normal self. I still love and care for her deeply, I even reached out to her last night to extend my compassion for her hurt. I don't hate her, I know how cliche it is but she was my best friend and i do not want to loose that friendship. I want her in my life, but not in a romantic way. With the distance I can see now that she wasn't the right match for me, just as i'm not the right match for her. But this is still rough, I honetly saw myself marrying her. We had plans to move across the country together, to start a life together, and now here I am. Alone, with no plans for my future. I was putting all of my eggs in that basket and now I don't know what to do with myself. I'm seriously considering just saying ""fuck it"" and moving California to get as far from here as possible. 

Im not sure if this is the right subreddit or not, I don't know what advice I could even be give. We broke up, we are over. But I miss her. I still love her. I can't stop thinking about her.

For those of you that read this, thanks for listening (reading?) me ramble on and on. I just don't know what to do with myself, but even just typing this all out has helped me feel a little better."

In school I was big on copy editing and working with writers to help them improve their writing, and when I had the time I really enjoyed writing as well. I ended up pursuing a career in public relations because the job market was stronger and for higher pay, but I'm wondering if I made the right choice. 

I'm getting excellent feedback from my employer and coworkers, but the days that it's stressful it's nuts. I've never felt so busy in my life and I worked 20-30 hours a week while going to school full-time and holding down an internship where I spent 10-20 hours a week. I'm often working through my lunch just to get work done and when it's extra busy I sometimes work from home off the clock. 

Is this normal for PR? I work with fairly high profile clients for the field, but I am at a loss for context regarding my daily tasks. 

I'm questioning whether this is the right career for me because I often wish I could be going back to editing and writing (I was expecting more writing in this job, but press releases typically go to in-house comms and we are doing all the media pitching/planning). 

Would I find more of what I'm looking for in a different agency, or in house somewhere? Or, are there other options I should consider that aren't even on my radar? Although I enjoy writing I don't have a lot of reporting under my belt and I'm not sure if journalism would pay the bills (however, if it did I would go for it if I could). 

I've only been in the job for a few months now, but I'm pretty sure my gripes aren't things that will go away with more experience. I'm just trying to figure out if it's the agency or the field that I'm having issues with, and I want to see what my options really look like. "

If you haven't yet, you should read my [intro post](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/rfewv/as_requested_hypocritical_hippocratic_oath/) about why I'm doing this series.

We had another guy, from New Hampshire, I think, somewhere north eastish anyway, who got in touch with us trying to get out of his service contract. We were like, no. So he claimed ~I~ gave him shoddy tech support. I showed one of the owners my support tickets and the owner was like ""looks good.""

Then he claimed our chief engineer had effed up the computer and so he wasn't paying because it wasn't working anyway. Chief pulls out HIS support tickets and the boss is like. . . ""I'm telling the jackass to go to hell.""

Comes time to pay the support contract fee. Doc doesn't pay, so the owner starts looking into sueing him.

Before that can even get off the ground, the Doc calls us, all friendly like and says, ""Hey, do you want to buy back the nuclear camera? I'll sell it to you for a third of what I paid for it (around $50k).

So, curious, our applications guy gets on the phone with the guys head nuke tech and is like ""Wtf is going on out there?""

Turns out, the doc is cash strapped and needs the money for legal fees to defend himself. ALL the major insurance providers are going after him big time, for fraud.

What was he doing?

Seems he was swapping the images of people with fine hearts with images of people with serious heart problems. Then recommending IMMEDIATE surgery, cutting folks open, sewing them back up again, telling them it was a great success and sending them on their merry way.

Then he was billing insurance for it to the tune of thousands.

I assume his operating theater staff were in on it, or were interns or something. I don't know how that part worked.

Big insurance nailed him with statistics. See, they know that if you bill for X number of heart scans, you should be doing X number of surgeries and they apparently watch for that. This guys surgery numbers were WAY higher than they should be.

**Why is this scary?**

Yeah, don't think I have to explain THIS one either. . . but the scary thing about it is, he's a DOCTOR. We're supposed to trust him. What about the people he terrified, the families he cause worry and trauma for, all so he could line his own pockets? That's why I'm a huge fan of second opinions."

**My education so far:**

I graduated from high school in 2007 and went to college for an IT based degree (finished 09/2011).



**My work history:**

In high school I worked landscaping and I taught guitar at a local music store (2004-2007). The owner I did landscaping with moved out of state in 06', and I had to stop teaching because of my college schedule. In 2008 I worked for a small business that ended up not having enough work to justify having a staff member, and several months later the business went under (I was there 2 months, 8 hours a week). 



**What I apply to:**

Ever since I started college I have been actively looking for some kind of work. I apply to every job under the sun; whether it is minimum wage, unpaid internships, or something in the IT field, I apply for it.

I've actually started keeping track of every job I apply to because I'm curious about the ratio of jobs to phone calls I'll receive (because applying online seems fruitless). From mid-February 2012 to this day I've filled out 317 applications and received 0 phone calls.

I have tried to use temp services but they have never offered me any work. Recruiters tell me I don't have enough experience (for the IT jobs) and they don't offer me any of the 'everyday' jobs because of my degree. I will work my ass off for any job offered to me, if I'm getting paid for something I'll put everything I have into it.

I would really like to move on with my life, but after nearly 4 years I really don't know what to do anymore. 

Can someone give me some advice?

I really appreciate you taking the time to read this.

My robotics team (no, it's not battlebots) has been involved with FIRST robotics for five years now. We have six weeks to design, fabricate, wire, and program a fully functional robot to play a game challenge every year. This year we designed a robot to play a fancy game of basketball. The game animation can be found here. We are a team of high school students who work with mentors from larger companies, such as Boeing and Microsoft.

My team, Team 2522 Royal Robotics is from Lynnwood, Washington. We have never done well in the robotics competitions each year, usually finishing in a low position. This year, we were ranked 6th out of 50 teams. We won the Engineering Inspiration award, and got the golden ticket to St. Louis, where the world championships are held. The championships are held at the end of the month, giving us little to no time to fund-raise money.

I would appreciate any help that you guys could give. Here is a link to the page where you can donate. When prompted, enter it for team 2522, LHS Royal Robotics. Any amount helps.

MORE IMPORTANTLY, I want to get this program more media and support. I am not the person who excels socially in high school. After I discovered our robotics team, a whole new world opened up for me. I got my feet wet with engineering, and have been the team's lead programmer for three years. I have worked with a Microsoft employee to improve my programming skills, and have landed multiple internship and scholarship opportunities. This program gives students experience and helps get students interested in an ever-expanding world of technology.

I really appreciate you taking the time to read this.

My robotics team (no, it's not battlebots) has been involved with FIRST robotics for five years now. We have six weeks to design, fabricate, wire, and program a fully functional robot to play a game challenge every year. This year we designed a robot to play a fancy game of basketball. The game animation can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOXsdhZZSdM). We are a team of high school students who work with mentors from larger companies, such as Boeing and Microsoft.

My team, Team 2522 Royal Robotics is from Lynnwood, Washington. We have never done well in the robotics competitions each year, usually finishing in a low position. This year, we were ranked 6th out of 50 teams. We won the Engineering Inspiration award, and got the golden ticket to St. Louis, where the world championships are held. The championships are held at the end of the month, giving us little to no time to fund-raise money.

I would appreciate any help that you guys could give. [Here](http://www.firstwa.org/Give/tabid/67/Default.aspx) is a link to the page where you can donate. When prompted, enter it for team 2522, LHS Royal Robotics. Any amount helps.

MORE IMPORTANTLY, I want to get this program more media and support. I am not the person who excels socially in high school. After I discovered our robotics team, a whole new world opened up for me. I got my feet wet with engineering, and have been the team's lead programmer for three years. I have worked with a Microsoft employee to improve my programming skills, and have landed multiple internship and scholarship opportunities. This program gives students experience and helps get students interested in an ever-expanding world of technology. It gives members a reason to finish high school and pursue a future that can change the world.

I am unsure if I would be a prospect for Big4 or If I should focus on networking with the other firms. I have a 3.7 cumulative gpa but no work experience and slightly barren resume.

If any recruiters or professionals could weight in on a few questions it would be greatly appreciated.

- What are some make or break issues during an interview for you? (Grades, personality, manners, etc.) I was told by a recruiter that during an interview she was asked other locations of company offices and it immediately ruined the candidates interview.
- What is your favorite question to ask during a interview or unique questions you have been asked?
- What should I focus on when talking to recruiters? (being friendly, showing myself as being professional, getting my name in their head, etc.)
- What question have you been asked by a student that made them stand out and helped them create a good impression with you?
- What qualities from recent candidates assured you to offer them a position or internship?

Thank you for reading this far. Any feedback you can give will be greatly appreciated and hopefully help me in the coming months!"

**Hi guys.** 

I just spent the past 4 years of my life being a national park ranger. I have a B.A. in Historic Preservation and worked for a brief time as an archeologist before I got the job as a park ranger. Specifically, I worked in Interpretation - so I gave the tours, staffed the front desk, did science, and assisted with search and rescue. I was not law enforcement or maintenance. I’m the person you’re most likely to interact with in the park.

I did 8 seasons in 6 different national park service units in the Southwest as a seasonal employee before making the hard decision to accept employment outside of the industry solely because I needed benefits and a somewhat steadier lifestyle. I would go back in an instant (if the job was a permanent job).

I had a lot of crazy experiences during my time out there. Ask me anything. I'll be here all night.

Other park rangers are welcome to add their stories into here as well.

**Links for those who want to work in this field**:

[Student Conservation Association](www.thesca.org). Make sure you bookmark it as thesca.org, because sca.org is the society for creative anachronism. Internships are the entry-level job in the park service. The only requirement is that you have been a student at some point in your life. I did my 1st internship after I graduated from college. Ignore the teens on the website, most interns now are in their 20’s or 30’s (at least at the places I worked). 

For a 3 month, 6 month, or year long internship, they pay you, your housing, your travel, and you get an Americorps award to help pay off your student loans.

[USAjobs](www.usajobs.gov).gov: where all the real park ranger jobs are posted for the BLM, NPS, and Forest Service. Writing a USAjobs resume is an artform. Search “park ranger” for general and law enforcement jobs, or “park guide” for the interpretation jobs. New jobs are usually posted Jan - Apr and Sept - Nov for the Spring and Fall seasonal jobs.

I have a friend who will be graduating with a Library Science degree soon who came down to stay with me for a spring break internship with the St. Louis Public Library system.  She apparently really hit it off with the administrator who suggested she apply for a job that opened up at the Julia Davis Library on Natural Bridge Road.  She had asked me about the area since she comes from a small town like me and has many of the misgivings about St. Louis that come with that sort of background, but she really wants the job, plus her husband (a Redditor!) plays in a band down here, so it would be a great move for them.

So help me put her mind at ease.  I already looked up the library location and it *is* north of Delmar which was one thing that made her uneasy, but it's really close to an area I used to live in just south of The Loop that I really loved, so I have a difficult time believing the area would be that bad.  What's the area just north of the Loop like?  Do any of you live there?  Do you think a late 20s/early 30s woman would be safe walking a short distance to and from her car in the early evening?  How exaggerated are the stories of the dangers of north St. Louis?  I already gave her that neighborhood guide posted a while back to help her see all that St. Louis has to offer, but any thoughts at all about the area she'd be working in would be amazing.  I really think she'd be happy down here, and I want to do whatever I can to make her feel safe and excited about moving to our awesome city.

Here's the library's address, just for reference:

Anyways, here's the deal.  I'm moving to New York on Saturday (April 1st) to pursue my long-term goal of becoming a DJ (probably not the kind your thinking of anyways), but like all creative types, I need a damn day job and need some advice on how to find one, I'd rather not have to resort to tap dancing outside Penn Station.  

Lets pause for a moment for a quick resume walk through: B.B.A. from University of Miami (2010), summer internship at law firm, worked at hotel front desk when I graduated, now work in Philly as legal assistant for litigation firm.  Whew, now the boring part is over and we can move on to what I am looking for.  
  
Honestly, I'm not that picky, like I said I'm not all that interested in making senior partner, I want to be a DJ.  However, don't mistake that for a lack of motivation.  I take my work very seriously regardless of the job title.  Here is where I am at in the process.  I've been applying to jobs for about three months now and I have registered with job agencies in NY (went for interviews with all of them, never heard back and don't return my calls). I've applied to countless jobs as an Admin/Receptionist at Hedge Funds and other types of financial firms and recently I've started to apply to hotels.  I want to work in a fast paced environment and work really long hours.  Really long hours? WTF is wrong with this kid? Yea, well I'm certainly not normal but I feel working in a rigorous environment is what I need at this point in my life.  I want to work and practice DJing and that's all.  Not really interested in having a social life or free time.  All of this would be nice but first I have to get a job or at least an interview and whatever I have been doing is not working. 

Let's move on to the Problems and Questions section.... 
1. I'm usually not fully qualified for the positions I apply to, but I know I could do the job and sell myself in the interview, but I never get one.  
2. Cover Letter- I hate lying on cover letters, is telling them about my creative pursuits an automatic red flag for me?  Not to sound like a dick, but who really really wants to be an Administrative Assistant or Receptionist, I don't understand how to respond when they say tell us why you want the job.  I can tell you why I want to work in that environment, but I seem to fail at the part where I express my passion for Microsoft Excel and copy machines.
3.Following Up- I'm guessing HR departments don't like people walking in during the day, is this absolutely off limits? (I have a really nice new suit, and could woo them with my charm and good looks?)  
4.If for some crazy reason I would get an interview, would I need to keep my mouth shut about the Djing stuff or do I answer honestly?
 
I have many other questions but I'll shut up for the time being.

In summation, thank you for reading and hopefully you were able to make it to the end of this post without asking what the hell is wrong with people... On a more serious note though, I could really use some advice.  New Yorkers, Recruiters, anybody in a similar position, I'm open to all suggestions.  Also feel free to ask me any questions about things I left out, just don't ask me to DJ at your kids birthday party.. :)

I also wanna get two hard drives and duel boot windows 7 so I can do some gaming. I am a pretty big console gamer and I wanna move that hobby to the PC but I don't want to switch from Mac. The games I would be trying to run would be Metro 2033, starcraft 2, diablo III, dota 2, Battlefield 3 and a few others. The editing rig I have now is an old i5 intel (the 1st mac with a intel chip), it is now out of date, runs very poorly and frequently crashes... What should I do? do you think I should go with a new imac and buy a gaming PC or should I just go balls out and get the mac pro? It is to my understanding that these machines last a wile and the parts are easily switched when new ones come out or old ones get too old."

The job comes with a pretty good benefits package, and there is 30-40% travel which I like. But the salary feels low, 40k. Maybe I am looking at this wrong, it is my first job out of school so maybe I was expecting more that I should have been.

what does reddit think?

Edit: I should mention where the job is located at, St. Louis, MO

Edit: Don't get me wrong I am stoked that I got the job, and actually will have a job when I graduate. I know people who been out for a year and are still looking, I feel very fortunate that I am not in their shoes."

It's overclocked to 1200MHz and is running Phiremod. I've had no trouble running games or watching video or anything. If you like comics this thing is amazing. It's a pretty great Android tablet and reader and has served me well.

However, I have a long-term overseas farm internship coming up and will inevitably be using it less for the Android functionality and more for the reading, and I'd like that battery life boost that comes with the eInk screen. So, I'd like to slim down to a Simple Touch (preferably with case). 

The Simple Touch has an MSRP of $99, and the Color is $169. I could just sell it on Craigslist and then pick up a new Simple Touch, but I'd rather just trade directly. Let me know if you're interested!

On March 8th, me and a friend interviewed with the same guy for an internship.  We both felt the interview went over very well.  On March 20th, I got an email from the man saying, ""Our internship director is out of the office right now, you'll hear within the first few weeks of April if  you got in internship.""  

But, I learned my friend got a similar letter days earlier from the same guy, except his had more specific information saying that their director is out on Maternity leave.

Today, my friend said he got his offering letter, which I read.  He got it two days ago, whereas I'm still waiting.  Furthermore, apparently he has until April 2nd to reply to that email.  While is is before the first few weeks of April, and there's still time, I'm beginning to worry.  The internship pays $15 an hour at 40 hours a week, and is one of those ""guaranteed a job at the end"" deals, which would help a metric crapton.

The guy called me up and said they had a full time freelance position opening (I work in video production), and it should turn into a permanent position by next year (with benefits and stuff).  It would just be me and this guy doing the video work for the local branch of a privately owned medical devices company. This is a billion dollar company btw.

So the interview went very well I think, but when we were discussing how I would get paid he said he didn't like to do the whole negotiating, lowball counteroffer stuff. Just to let him know what I needed, he thinks the company would pay anywhere from 35-50k a year starting out(for the permanent position with benefits). So for the freelance he suggested I add another 10k or so, so I could get my own insurance and what have you. 

He wants me to tell him what I think I would need for the initial freelance position. So...I mean, should I just go ahead and say 60k? Or..is that rude, or would put me out of the running? Obviously I want the most I can get.  Plus I think I deserve it. I am very good at what I do and I have a master's degree in the field.  And I am 70k in debt from school.  I would like to be able to own a house one day and not have roommates anymore. You know...kinda grow up. I'm 27/male.

1. Will it be easier to get a job during the summer in State College (as opposed to once the semester starts)?

2. Will I be able to carry on with the job my first semester of college? If anyone has experience working during school, I'd love to hear about it. I'm a good student, so I'm not too concerned with the workload vs. the work schedule, but I have never been to college before so I'm not 100% sure!

I have registered with three different job agencies and never heard back from them after going to NY for an interview.  Recently, I have become quite frustrated due to this and am becoming increasingly nervous about moving to New York without a job.  I have friends I can stay with in the mean time but am not comfortable with living off them for more than a month.  Let me tell you about myself (I'll try to keep it as short as possible).  I graduated from a reputable university in 2010 and received my Bachelors Degree in Business.  I had summer internships with a law firm.  When I graduated I took a position at a boutique hotel working as a Guest Service Assistant.  Since April 2011, I have been employed by a law firm in Philly doing legal assistant work.  I am moving to New York in order to pursue my long-term goal of being a DJ, but that is a long ways off if it ever happens at all and I am more than aware that I need to earn a living until that becomes my source of income.  Ideally, I would like to work for a financial firm as an admin assistant or receptionist, or in a hotel, but I have found I'm not exactly qualified for many of those positions.  I'm open to many different types of jobs, but I would prefer one in a fast-paced environment that requires long hours.  I would appreciate some insight on how my interest in being a DJ would come off to a potential employer, as I hate lying in interviews and in cover letters and I would really appreciate some advice on finding a job in general.

 I’m a mom with 2 kids (4 if you count SO’s kids who we have a lot) 
One of those kids being a new baby 3 months old. 
Last October I was giving a raise and promotion at my job. Basically doing the same thing that I had been doing but more money and better title. 
Last Wednesday I was offered a position in my dept, supervisor position that is…..

I would still be reporting to the same people, who I like and enjoy working with. 
I would be supervising the team that I have worked with for years. I’ve always sort of been in an authority position just without the title. I like these people for the most part. 

Here are my worries. I would have to spend the next few months learning the new role and would probably have the position official by end of summer. (Which means I don’t think I would see a pay increase till the end of the summer, nor a shift change, I asked to go to four tens.)
I would spend less time at home because my hours would change to 830 to 500 (if they don’t approve schedule change) and occasionally staying late to close down the building when needed. (probably not too often though) possibility of travel about once every 3 months. The added stress of being a new supervisor to people that I was on equal field with previously. Feeling like I was losing out on my baby’s milestones. 
Stressful evenings because of cooking, cleaning, taking care of baby with getting home later. Boyfriend does help me out but I feel like the role of mom should be left to me. 
SO is also moving up in his company and is in management training 3 days a week with other managers (he is not a manager yet but they have been prepping him for that position) My commute sucks, its 45 to 50 mins each way. 

I cried after picking up my daughter from daycare (3rd day). I get so sad when someone else is telling me about her day. Thankfully I didn’t cry till I got home. It really bothers me that I’m not there with her. 

SO makes really good money a lot more money than me, we can technically survive on his income alone. My income is just extra money that would pay for daycare, fixing up the house, vacations, maybe a minivan in the near future. Even if I were to take this job I would still not come close to what SO makes. If I were to quit we would have to cut down on certain things, we already cancelled cable, and we don’t eat out often. On paper budget wise I could stay home. 
I would lose my really great insurance. 

I was considering being a sahm and was pretty set in my decision just didn’t know when to put in my notice because of my help being on maternity leave as well and a couple other people have gotten promoted in my dept and we are down people. I wanted to leave the company on good terms and feel guilty if I were to leave at a bad time. 

The pro’s are- I would be making more money. I think I would get about a $2 or $3 raise, maybe more my boss wasn’t sure because it wouldn’t be his decision. I would be salary. 
This is good for my career. I put myself through school as a single mother paying cash the entire time for a bachelor’s degree so I wouldn’t have student loans. I graduated in April of 2011. I worked my butt off going to school full time and working this job full time while also maintaining a house and mothering my teenage daughter (she is 15) 
A little background so no one is confused. My boyfriend and I moved in together in August of last year so I was no longer a single parent at that point. We bought a house in Dec of 2011 and have been living and parenting our children very happily ever since. 

SO and I have talked and talked about this, ( I thought it was coming with being offered the new job) SO is a ‘provider’ his words and would rather have me sah. However he says he will support me in whatever decision I make. 

I’m so stressed over this and honestly feel like I’m stuck in a rut. My boss told me that I’m the only person internally that they are considering for this job and if I don’t accept it they will hire outside the company. 

The company I work for is actually really great, pretty family oriented. We get lots of vacation time and days off and the benefits are pretty good in this economy. 
I’m already vested in the company with my 401k, and once I’m here 7 years ( in Jan 2013) I will start accruing 2 days off a month instead of 1 ½, in addition we usually get about 15 days off a year paid for holiday, work shuts down over Christmas for minimum of a week. 
Plus my teenage daughter may be allowed to intern this summer in a different department. My bosses are looking into it currently. She would be making 10 an hour and she is excited to be able to work and put the money away. 

My work will not allow me to work from home, and will not allow me to switch my schedule to better accommodate my life at this point. 
Advice PLEASE!!!

I'm torn on whether I should go ahead and get the masters, or move on from school and start real life. On the one hand I'm ready to stop going to school and start working and such. On the other hand I don't mind school, I like learning and I genuinely find what I'm learning in my CS classes very interesting. I'm also not a huge fan of writing, so the idea of a thesis is a little daunting, and I'm not even sure what topic I'd like to research. All I've really taken so far is the core CS classes. I'm taking all my CS electives the next two semesters, so I'm not sure what my specific interests are. I know I don't really care about game design, HCI, or other graphics oriented things. I find cyber security interesting, but I won't be able to take a course on it until another semester or two, so I don't really know for sure I'll actually like it. I also like general software development and like scientific computing, data mining, practical uses of computing, etc.

It's for retail folks who have to manually count out a cash drawer at the end of the night. It accepts the amount of each piece of money in the till, as well as the total to be left for the next day, and outputs an array that tells them what to pull! 

Right now it's setup with a ""presentation"" index page that asks for user input. That input gets put over to a ""business"" changemaker page that verifies the data and then runs the functions and outputs a the message to pull. If a entry field is blank or was submitted somehow besides POST, it puts the user back at index and asks to enter all fields.

Hope it looks good to you pro's out there. I'm working to either get an internship or junior job by summer time. Thanks for checking.

I am a current sophomore at _____ seeking an internship in marketing that will help me to gain useful experience and narrow my interest in the field. My interest in marketing and advertising is long-rooted; I first decided I wanted to pursue a career in the field when my fifth-grade class visited (agency I'm applying to) in 2003, and I spent a week job shadowing at the company in 2008 with (my high school)’s career exploration program. Now as a student who is preparing for the creative field with a double major in Communication English Literature and a minor in Vocal Performance, I would be thrilled to return to ____ for an internship opportunity during the 2012 summer. I am additionally eager to assist the tasks of the company with my creative outlook, social perceptiveness, and dependable work ethic. Because it is early in my academic career and I’m still working to shape my ambitions, I would be happy to gain any experience available. However, I’m particularly interested in anything that involves writing or working with concepts and ideas, and would be excited to test the waters of Interactive, Media or PR.

In my Communication classes I study culture, media, and rhetoric, and in my English classes I refine my writing skills. I regularly exercise my creativity through several outlets on campus; I arrange songs and perform them with ___ , my college A Cappella group, and I’m an editor of a popular daily publication called ____ , which serves as an often-controversial forum for humor, satire, and student dialogue. My position, which was earned upon a selective application process, requires me to contribute satirical articles, review student submissions and edit the _____ 's format with the use of computer software to be ready for printing the next day. I have an optimistic outlook that is great for working with others; I believe the only things worth disliking in life are things that are boring and things that promote ignorance or unkindness. I’m a responsible and determined worker, and I understand the importance of maintaining the seriousness necessary for high standards and performance in the workplace – but no more seriousness than that. I’m a fan of irony and things that are a little bit ridiculous. I’m a skilled observer; I like to see things from multiple angles, and I constantly wonder why – a state of mind so lovingly regarded by my friends as “(myname)land.” Given my attention to detail, it’s a wonder I make it out of my house in the morning to get anything done. But I do, I do it well, and I will do it with determination and excellence at _____ . 

Thank you for considering my skills and experience as a contribution to your agency’s goals, as well as my desire to gain experience from your company. I will follow up by email within the next two weeks, and I’m available to be contacted by phone or email anytime for further questions.

I'm in a frustrated mindset, and I want opinions on my situation and whether I should look into a lawyer or not.

Background:
I've gone to a college for a long time (started in 2005). I took one year off to get my life priorities in order and come back (I'll admit, I slacked as a freshman). When I came back to school, I got into my major of choice and proceeded to kick ass and take names. I pulled my gpa up and started doing well.

Fast forward to the last year, I finished up every requirement except the internship. I was having problems finding one, and I really wanted to graduate. The internship program at my school strictly states that I need to complete my internship in the summertime, I had just moved to a new city and didn't find one until 1-2 weeks after the deadline. I tried contacting the school to find who to appeal to but no luck.

**Beginning of August** - I managed to get a hold of the dean of the department regarding my situation. I had found a temp-tern position and decided to write an appeal. I'm told that nothing can be done until the middle of September due to lack of staff. So I wait...

**October 15th** comes around and I received an email from the school saying I was being discontinued (I received no forewarning), I file for leave of absence and try to explain my situation. I contact the dean of the department again, and he lets me know that he wishes I would've contacted him sooner (I regret my delay, but I was very busy with moving/new job so I didn't notice my school email). He informs me to contact the new internship director regarding my situation.

I email the internship director, and am told that he will keep me posted as the department tries to find out a resolution for me. So I wait...

**November 11th** and I still had not heard a reply, so I send him an email asking for an update.

**November 14th** and I get an email saying he has not heard a decision yet, and will followup on this same day.

**December 1st** I'm hired into the company full time.

**December 6** - I email the dean asking for an update. Noting that the new internship director had not responded and I have since been hired.

**December 7** - I'm told he will look into the matter and let me know.

**December 18** - I ask for another update from the dean and get a response. He lets me know he that the new internship director has been contacted and will follow up with me.

**January 06** - The new director contacts me with a cryptic message saying ""the decision has not changed"". He recommends an appeal to the dean if I am not satisfied.

*At this point I feel like I'm being given the run-around.*

**January 9-12** I contact the dean again with an appeal. He once again refers me to the internship director. The internship director never gives me a clear answer so I get frustrated and mention that I should be forwarding all of this to the dean of the school. The internship director never responds. So I email the dean asking for another update (while apologizing for my frustrated remarks. Rereading my emails it's easy to see that I was angry when I sent a response to the director).

**January 13** - The dean lets me know he's looking into the issue and will get back to me. The internship director responds that they have worked out a plan and I need to sign up for spring term.

**January 29** - I get another notice that I'm going to be discontinued and will have to reapply if this is the case. I submit another leave of absence form and get approved.

**March 15** - My friend notifies me it's the end of the quarter. So I send the internship director an email asking for advice on the next steps.


**March 25** I send another email because I had received no response. I receive an email saying I have the go ahead to start the filling out the internship contracts and I need to follow the internship requirements.

**March 26th** I respond that I have spoken with HR and they've agreed to fill out paperwork for the past few months that they agreed to for the internship position (like they had said before). I forward this information to the internship director.

**March 27th** I receive another update saying I will have to start the internship over completely. 

*So I call the internship director*

I restate my situation... That I missed the internship by 1-2 weeks because I could not find one, submitted an appeal, was referred to him...
He states that because he was not in control at the time, he can't do anything and that I would need to restart the internship completely. I let him know that because the assignments are not through the employer, it would make more sense for me to have the employer fill out the necessary documents based on my 3 months as a temp-tern. Then he starts getting angry, he says ""If it was fully up to me, I would not let you in. If this was the business world I would fire you for not following up"".

I mention to him that I had tried following up but he had never responded to me. I had waited months at a time for a response, and that I had been given the most roundabout way of getting to a solution.

He continues with the rude comments about me being a slacker, how I'm unprofessional, and he wouldn't hire me because I've waited so long (He's increasingly rude at this point). I ask who I can speak to that's above him, but he doesn't give me any names. He simply states that he is the one to talk to.



So.... Reddit, I ask you for advice. I told my employer that I was finishing up my degree back in August when they first took me as a temp-tern. Now that I've been hired, I can't exactly go back to an intern position, and yet this is all I'm told to do. Even though I have already done all the hours and I'm sure my employer would be able to fill out accurate feedback of my time there.

Am I wrong for being slow to the game (yes). However, I do not feel that this sort of behavior from school officials should be tolerated. Especially when I've spent around $100,000 out of pocket to attend.

Please advise!

I am interested in applying for the scientific research summer internship position that was listed through the University of ___ Career Services Office. I am sending my resume, so you can determine whether I qualify for the Internship with the Urban Wildlife Institute.


I have had a great deal of laboratory experience in chemistry, biology, physics, soils, and ecology. My laboratory experience pertains to both field techniques as well as indoor lab skills. I possess excellent troubleshooting skills which can assist with trapping, using remote-triggered cameras, radio equipment, and almost all essential computer skills needed for the position. In addition to assisting with the wildlife research, I can easily work well with other in a group project, as well as working individually on a project, where I have done so in the many Environmental courses I have taken. As a Natural Resources and Environmental Science major I believe I am qualified by my knowledge of Ecology, the Illinois fauna, and my commitment to wildlife conservation. Also, as an active member of the Illini foresters and Red Bison two environmental clubs at the University of Illinois, where I participate in wildlife management, and the conservation of fields in the Champaign area, there we steward areas with some lopping and pruning. 


I believe that I would an asset to your program. This internship would provide me with the ideal opportunity to assist at your organization and to expand my research skills. I am willing to whatever institute related activities as necessary, as well as work outside and early morning hours. If so, I hope to schedule an interview at a mutually convenient time. I look forward to speaking with you.
Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely,

Normally, not such a big deal, but apparently April has a personal problem with me.  I am RAVENOUS and utterly exhausted.  This is really interfering with my 1260 calorie days and cardio/weight routine.

Today, I woke up late for my internship and missed breakfast.  Which meant a higher calorie granola snack pack and 10:00 am oatmeal.  Lunch I did awesome, spinach salad and cottage cheese.  Dinner was fine too, but life went downhill after that.

First off, I'm staying late at the family's home that I nanny for.  So I went straight from the office from here.  Ate my portioned dinner and snack . . . and then Tucan Sam called.  I have probably overeaten by roughly 400 calories . . . all of which were Fruit Loops.  Added to that, the parents texted me and are running later than planned so no work out after this either.

I feel really embarrassed.  I haven't binged in months and I am so so so disappointed.  I haven't broken my calories during the week in forever.  Plus no work out?  Plus bathing suit season?  Ouch.  How do you guys deal with stuff like this?  Any motivation to get me back on track?  I'd appreciate it, I'm down 20 pounds since last summer and am finally at my goal weight.  I keep finding that I have very real anxiety of gaining any back.  Cheerful thoughts and period busting tricks appreciated =)"

advice?",ferrarisnowday,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/rgxei/shafted_by_my_schools_internship_requirement_any/,"I'm writing this partially to vent and partially to ask for advice.  I'm posting this to /r/lostgeneration because I'd also like to spawn a discussion on internship requirements in general.  I think the best way for me to tell the story is chronologically in the way it happened to me.  It will be wordy, but I hope I can make it coherent so that you can follow the ups and downs.

**Jan. 2011**

Classes for my Master's program start.  I'm working through a contracting agency, not exactly happy with my job situtaion at the time.  I'm aware that my degree requires a 200 our internship in order to graduate.  I figure the school can help hook me up with companies, and it will be worth it because I can hopefully get hired in or at least make good contacts and get industry experience.  You know, the typical internship stuff.

**May 2011**

Holy shit!  I've just been hired in to a full time job directly in my current field of study!  I'm feeling awesome and am flying high.  I even begin to feel like I don't need the MS after all, but I decide to stick with it for a few reasons.  1.)  My work will pay for roughly 1/4th of it.  2.)  Should I ever switch companies, the MS will help on my resume.  3.)  An MS can also help meet requirements for higher pay grades in the future.

**August 2011**

I officially ask my advisor if I can use my current job as the internship.  He says yes, and I officially register for the internship.  I submit all the forms, and I'm officially in the class titled ""&lt;my program name&gt; internship"" (not actually a class, by the way, it's just credits).  Now, I'm a full time student that semester, but I decide to drop a class.  It was too simple, I have an Information Science undergrad degree and the first day of this class was about the difference between hard disks and RAM.  With the way my school prices credits for full time vs. part time, which could be a post in itself, I decide to postpone the internship, too -- so I drop the ""internship"" course, as well as the overly simple IT course.  Doing this rearrangement me about $3,000 on my degree overall, not just that semester.

**March 2012**

This whole time, I've been feeling ripped of that I should have to pay nearly 3 grand just for my school to acknowledge that I already work in the field.  I decide to write the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies a polite e-mail explaining how I feel.  I offer to take an extra course in lieu of the internship, as I already have far more than 200 hours of experience in the field.  Surprisingly, she says there is a form that I can fill out for a $100 fee that will give me credit for the internship since I already have the experience.  I go and get this form, but am slow to turn it in.

Side note:  why didn't my advisor know about this money saving form when I asked if I could be let out of the internship requirement!?  This is just the first example of the university showing an inability to empathize with the students and the huge costs of school.

**Later in March 2012**

I suddenly receive an e-mail from my advisor saying that the department chair has now stated that even though I work in the field, not only must I pay for the internship, I can't even used my job as the internship!  I *must* find an internship at an outside company.

* Nevermind that I already have 2,000 hours of experience directly in the field.  10x what the internship requires.

* Nevermind that you already let me actually *register* for the internship course in the Fall, using my current job.

* Nevermind that this is a program aimed towards working professionals.  Roughly 2 out of 3 students have full time jobs, many of them in the industry or even in the field directly.

* BUT MOST OF ALL:  Nevermind that I carefully budgeted and scheduled when to take my credits so that it would be as cheap as possible with my school's pricing structure.  Taking on this internship and still graduating on time could very well cost me $3,000 - via kicking me from part time to full time in my final semester.  I *could* try to cram an internship in the summer.  But frankly, I shouldn't have to.  Months ago I was told by my advisor that I wouldn't have to.  And just this month I was told by one of the Deans that I wouldn't even have to pay for anything besides a $100 exmpetion fee.  Why the dean is overridden by, or yielding to, the department chair, I have no clue.

Anybody have similar experiences?  Any advice on how to take this up or if I should just cut my losses and give up on it.

Any thoughts on why my school is so lame-brained as to require internships from people who already work in the field - even as their fellow full time students without jobs get by with just a 200 hour internship?

Any thoughs on schools requiring interships in general?  Why should students have to essentially find their own internships, and then pay the school thousands of dollars just to acknowledge it?

**TL;DR School can't get their act together about the internship requirement, probably costing me both money and time.  Misery loves company - share your stories if you have them.**

EDIT:  One last thing, the department chair has to accept and approve of a scholarly paper (mini-thesis) written by each student before graduation.  Pissing her off would be a bad move.  I need to handle this diplomatically, if I do anything at all."

rgtlb,11,2012-03-27,How to land an internship on Capitol Hill (or anywhere else),Mad-Dawg,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/rgtlb/how_to_land_an_internship_on_capitol_hill_or/,"Listen up, ladies! We need more of us in government positions, and that means starting off as an intern. In a recent position with a U.S. Senator, I was an intern hiring manager in charge of both undergraduate and law clerk applicants. I now work for a small non-profit organization, and am again in charge of hiring for the intern program. 


In these experience I have seen a lot of resumes. Hundreds and hundreds. But among the undergraduate applicants, I can only recall two resumes that followed what I consider to be bare minimum resume guidelines. For a while I thought that I was the problem, until I had a meeting today with 10 other intern hiring managers in DC. They all had the same thing to say: applicants have amazing experience, but it's clear there is a general failure to teach young men and women how to write a resume. 


I want to share with you my top ten rules for resuemes. These apply to all applications, but the first item goes into specific detail about Capitol Hill. Like I said, these may come across as basic, but I have seen only two out of hundreds of applicants that met all of these criteria. Do these things and I can almost guarantee your application will outshine the rest :)


Feel free to ask me specific questions!


**1. Do apply**
Despite how many applications an organization or company may receive for a single application, very few of them stand out for being properly formatting and following all expectations. Applicants would be surprised to learn just how desperate a desirable office is for resumes. Speaking from my experience on Capitol Hill, you actually have a pretty good chance of being accepted for an internship if you apply for the Representative or Senator who actually represents you. Members prefer to hire one of their own constituents, and often not a whole lot of hopefuls apply. Find your Senators here, and your Representatives here. 


**2. Do limit your resume to one page**
Resumes that go beyond a single page are only appropriate in an academic, or similar, environment that puts an emphasis on publications, or if the applicant has an extensive work history. An intern applicant will probably never fall into that category unless he or she had a career before trying something new 

**3. Do focus on your college experience**
Unless an intern is applying for a position in her first semester of college, or did not attend college, her high school name and graduating rank are irrelevant and should not be on the resume because they take up valuable space and seem immature. 

**4. Do think about whether or not to list your GPA**
The general rule of thumb on GPAs is that if a student’s GPA is above 3.5, it should go on the resume. If it is not on the resume, it is safe to assume the GPA is below 3.5.  There’s no need to bring attention to a GPA lower than that in black and white. That said, most hiring managers know that a student without a stellar GPA can still be a stellar intern.  

**5. Do not be afraid to fill empty space with your interests**
Most intern applicants apply to get experience, and may not have enough previous experience to fill a full page. If that’s the case, an applicant should not be afraid to list a few interests. Law schools are even encouraging their students and recent graduates to do this, because it creates an opportunity to connect with shared interests. As a personal anecdote, I once pulled a candidate to the top of the pile because he listed “wordplay” as one of his interests and I wanted someone in the office to laugh at my lame puns. He got the job, and did not disappoint! 

**6. Do put a lot of time and effort into your cover letter**
A cover letter should be customized for every internship position an applicant applies for. And it should include two important things: how the applicant has the skills required for the position (named specifically) and why the specific organization or company she is applying to is a good fit. 

**7. Do be aware of what the baseline expectations are for an applicant with your experience**
Listing skills all applicants are already expected to have takes up too much space and can be a turn-off. Most intern applicants are expected to be proficient in Microsoft Word and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. 

**8. Do submit PDFs of your resume**
PDFs preserve the formatting no matter who opens the document, and comes across as a lot more professional than a Word document. An applicant can create a PDF version of a Word document through the print screen. It will often be an option in the printer selection menu. The applicant should should remove hyperlinks from email addresses by right-clicking because they will be inactive in the PDF. 

**9. Do send a thank you email if you are interviewed**
A brief thank you email should be sent the evening of the interview

**10. Do be patient**
Following up on an application to make sure it was received is okay, but asking the status of the application can be irritating to the hiring manger. The exception is if you are contacted by the organization or company first. If you receive an interview, ask when you should expect to hear a decision. If you had not heard anything after a week past that deadline, then it is a good idea to follow-up.

rk0vg,2,2012-03-29,Just cut myself for the first time in two years and now...,idiothere,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rk0vg/just_cut_myself_for_the_first_time_in_two_years/,"(Throwaway account, people I work with use reddit.)

I'm pretty sure my boyfriend is going to leave me. He said he would if I did. It's not like I deserve a boyfriend anyway, especially not one as good as him.

I deserve to be alone.

Sometimes it feels like everyone else in the world is in one big club where they can figure things out. I feel barely conscious most of the time. I wish I could always be asleep. 

I hate going to college. I hate it. I don't want to do it anymore. I hate my internship. I can never do anything right there. The only feedback I get is disappointment. I know they wish I wasn't there. I know they know I have no potential.

When I come to work...I hide. As much as I can. 

I thought I was doing everything right, but, of course, I was not. Why would I ever think I could do something right?

I'm supposed to be asking for help, but the guy I have to ask for help is one of the most unapproachable, gruff people I have ever had to encounter. Every day, it's something new.

And I know he is only that way to me because I'm such a fuck up. Soon, they will ask me not to come back... ""you're messing up too much,"" ""you're too much of a liability.""

I can already hear it now.

I am a fuck up in my science class. Two 50s on the first two exams. GREAT JOB! 

I have literally never worked so hard for a class and failed so miserably.

I'm such a god damned idiot that I have to get special accommodations for taking tests. Not like that will help, though. 

I have no future. I barely have a present.

Why live if you can never fully enjoy life?

I don't deserve this life. I wish I could give it to someone who would use it more wisely.

But I can't get myself to die. I'm a fuck up with that, too.

I'm so depressed now that I am exhausted. I stay at home. I don't like to go out.

I have friends, but they can never know how deep my depression is...or I will lose them.

The only way I have been able to make/keep friends is through pretending I am a confident, interesting and happy woman.

...I'm not really.

I feel so stressed out. Is it worth it to do something for 4+ years that makes you so miserable just so there is a small chance that you *might* make it?

Every other intern's jobs are going swimmingly. They're learning, making friends, making connections. I haven't done any of that. I come in, ask if I can use one of the offices, and work on a project that I hate. And up until now, I thought I was at least doing *that* right.

Nope.

Of course I'm not doing it right. Why would I be?

I want it to end.

I want to live somewhere where the grass is green, where I can go to the beach, where I can live with my boyfriend and the stress and pain of my every day life are no longer an issue.

Life is hard.

But some of us can't deal with it. I'm one of those people who can't.

At least they have something going for them. College and studying come naturally (or at least they learned the best way to study for them) for most of the students at my university. 

It's like I've forgotten how to take a test or how to study. Three years in and I've gotten worse at this. How does that even happen?

Soon I will be completely alone. Soon I will have no reason not to cut myself. It got me through my first year of college, so why not my third?

I'm seeing my psychologist on Monday and I hate lying to him (that accomplishes nothing), but I don't want to disappoint someone again. With some people, they expect that from me. Disappointment after disappointment. But I don't know him as well, so I haven't had a chance to fuck up yet.

He asked me to start meditating. I acted eager and interested, but I knew I wouldn't try it. And I didn't.

I don't want to tell him I cut myself.

I don't want to tell him I failed. I'm so tired of failing.

Please. Can one of you make this stop?

Please.

I wish my mom had not had me. I was born depressed. Then my childhood was complete shit, and from that my brain changed, causing more depression.

I will struggle with this for the rest of my life, and it will only get worse.

Can one of you please make this stop?

I keep imagining myself ramming my head into a wall. That's all I want to do. Just let my frustrations out. But I can't. I am a coward. I'm not even good at hurting myself.

Not good at one single thing.

I've tried to look on some things that I might be good at.

Not one.

I don't do anything but go to school, browse reddit and watch NetFlix.

At least my boyfriend has built houses. At least my best friend is a renaissance woman. They are brilliant at what they do.

I have nothing to offer.

Nothing."

I have been struggling with bouts of depression that correlate to my struggles with employment. I have a Master's degree that I finished in 2008 and still carry the student debt that came along with it. Since 2008 I have lived at home with my parents, save for a one year contract job in another city, which was terminated suddenly. My parents are very supportive but it kills me that I can't support myself - needing them financially causes me another level of anxiety.

After finishing school, the job market was tough, so I bounced around between minor contracts, working retail, and unemployment. I felt fed up, and so I went back to school and earned a career certificate. This lead to unpaid internships, and then the above-mentioned one year contract. That ended 2 months ago and I haven't been able to make any headway since then.

I paid a lot of money to a professional resume writing service to spruce up my applications and send them to recruiters, which also didn't lead me anywhere. I have had a total of 5 interviews for paying jobs in literally hundreds of job applications, and most of the time, after those interviews I don't even get a courtesy call or email to let me know I wasn't getting the job.

Yesterday I interviewed for an unpaid internship, with a referral from a lady who I had interned for before. They offered it to someone else. I'm not even a desirable candidate to work for free anymore.

I'm single, which doesn't bother me, and I've consciously made the choice to put my career efforts first in my life in recent years, but that being said, I feel so incredibly alone.

My thoughts of suicide as a way out were stopped when I realized the life insurance on my debt wouldn't cover it, and I can't stick my parents with my financial burden like that (anymore than I already am). Realizing this just made me feel more stuck and lost.

I see people all around me, in the same fields I'm trying to work in, who don't seem to need to work so hard to accomplish so little. I apply to jobs outside of my field, but I don't get considered because I don't have the right qualifications.

I feel lost and desperate for a change, for a break in my struggling. I have a strong work ethic, and I just want to work hard for a company that appreciates it. I'm smart and hard-working, and I'm pretty normal-looking, so don't think there are any obvious problems with how I come off in an interview. People are always saying my resume is impressive, but how do I take that and make it into a job offer?

WTF am I supposed to do to grow up and be able to take care of myself like an adult? I just need someone to give me a break, or give me a chance, or something :*("
rjrn0,4,2012-03-29,Applying for an internship,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/rjrn0/applying_for_an_internship/,"Just dropped an application off for an internship with my city, and I think some of you might find this amusing.

I'll be as brief as possible.  I got hassled over the application I printed and filled out because it was slightly different from the ones they had in their office (a single question was worded differently).  Eventually the desk lady, who seemed confused on what to do, decided that since I filled out the one that was provided to me online, she would accept it.  

I asked if they haven't been receiving many handwritten applications, and she responded, ""No, most are submitted online.."" and then tapped on the job title and said, ""especially for a position like this.. I mean, I guess if some people don't know how to use a computer or whatever..""  I didn't even know what to say.

**TL;DR**:  Hassled over my application which was printed directly from their website.  Then it was suggested that because I filled it out and brought it in, I don't know how to use a computer.

Was anyone else under the impression that it's a better idea to bring in applications to have a face-to-face rather than submitting online?"

rji24,2,2012-03-29,I just asked my girlfriend for a break. Then she told me she had a miscarriage this week. What the flying fuck do I do.,pungellin,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rji24/i_just_asked_my_girlfriend_for_a_break_then_she/,"My (maybe ex) girlfriend is a needy, manipulative bitch. But she has good reasons and can't help it.  She's been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. she was adopted and has hella abandonment issues. She's dealt with eating disorders, self harm, and several suicide attempts. I'm depressed and in between meds so I really don't help. But last semester, before I was depressed, I helped her through the suicidal thoughts (mostly), eating disorders (when she's not home and relapses), and the self harm (except for one time when my situation made things especially hard). Plus, she's definitely among the sweetest, most caring people on the planet. And I love her.

The past week, the manipulative bitchy part has been coming out. I've been going back and forth about whether our relationship is best for me. So I decide that we should take a break. For us. So I can recover a bit from her manipulative, hurtful comments (which aren't her fault) and then come back and we can be happy forever again.

So we talk about this. Then I leave for my internship. Then she facebook chats me. Part of the reason she was being manipulative-bitchy-BPD was that she had a miscarriage over the weekend. We lost our first kid.

Part of me is like, ""This is tough. She needs you. And right now. You need to make yourself throw up so you can leave your internship and she can have sweet, sweet cuddles.""

Another part is like, ""No... you need to do what's good for you. You need to recover. You need time to make yourself strong again so you can be awesome for her again. She's so much stronger now than in the fall. She will be fine, and soon, so will you.""

A third part is like, ""You don't seriously plan on getting back with her, do you? She's not right, this isn't a sustainable relationship. Fuck her reasons, she manipulates you, threatens suicide, she isn't even OK with you being bisexual... even though she is too! Fuck that shit, she needs to solve herself, then find someone more forgiving.""

So... I don't know what to do. We were going to move in together, but I'm already looking for other places next year (Which will hurt her even more, I slept with the girl I could be living with before I met the current gf and she's always been jealous even though we're just friends and agreed it was a one time thing).

So my plan is this: Ask random internet people. What should I do, reddit? Is she worth it?

**TL;DR** Starts dating girl who redefines ""baggage"". Takes break from bad-but-worth-it relationship. She miscarries, I(edit: **WE**) didn't know she was pregnant. What the fuck does a man do?"

However, networking presents a huge challenge for me.  How am I supposed to do so when I have such a different conception of ""I"" than almost every other person around me?  It's perfectly common for most people to be able to say ""Hi, I'm Mr. So and So, I do this, I have won these awards, I'm the best"" etc. etc. but I feel like I'm far too modest to go around to business professionals and try to thrust some construct of myself around in need or recognition as if I'm really that important.

I'm anxious because the information in classes is pretty basic, and some classes, the way the professor teaches, I'm just learning how to solve some specific problems rather than the ins and outs of the discipline. I am feeling anxiety about internships and my future career. How capable were you when you got an internship? Was it something you would be able to do without any training or did most of what you did come after training by your employers?

I guess most of my anxiety comes from not having much engineering experience. I was thinking of joining Formula SAE, but apparantly they don't teach you anything, and I do not know much at all about cars. I'm also trying to find research opportunities with an engineering professor. Some kids in my classes just seem to know so much about specific engineering applications, and I feel like I do not.

Is this normal for alot of engineering students? Any advice and tips would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for reading. So my situation is this: my girlfriend and I are both medical students in a long distance relationship (~2 hour flight). We're both at the end of 2nd year, and while I'm preparing for 3rd year, she's about to enter the PhD portion of an MD/PhD. Right now, the plan is for me to match to where she is (a major city), upon which we'd hopefully be able to start a family (I know this isn't a given, and we have contingency plans, but let's assume it happens for now).

My question is, when would be the best time to have children in this situation? As soon as we're together, I'll be a (probable) surgical intern working my tail off, and she'll be doing her PhD. Even if her schedule is a little more flexible than mine, I'm not really sure where the time sacrifices are going to come from. And things will be even more stressful once she re-enters the MD curriculum, followed by her own residency. Would it be better to hold off on kids until our residencies are farther along and we might both have a little time? If I learned anything in med school about this, 35 is kind of the upper limit for women in terms of childbearing. We've dated for 6 years now, and at this point the only reservation we have is how this whole raising-a-family-while-both-crazily-busy thing is going to work out.

rix8j,2,2012-03-29,My girlfriend is being physically abused by her stepfather. What do I do?,GFsabused,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rix8j/my_girlfriend_is_being_physically_abused_by_her/,"The obvious answer is report it. Call CPS/the police. I did that a while ago. I'll get to that in a bit. I'm 17, she's 16, both Juniors in High School, Oregon, USA. She's been living with her stepdad, mother, and younger sister since she was 4. The physical abuse started at 6, with beatings about every three months. Not ""severe,"" not enough to really leave any marks, but definitely enough to cause harm (and with a belt, if that matters). In case anyone's thinking it, no, she did/does not ""deserve"" it. The first I'd heard about it was about 10 months ago, when she told me that she is beaten about every three months. Ironically, later that same day, he beat her, for drinking his cranberry juice (No, he's not an alcoholic. No, he's taking any meds, nor is he prescribed any. And no, he doesn't do drugs. Thought I'd get that out of the way). I thought she was joking at first. Then I hoped she was joking. She wasn't. I was freaking out, she told me to calm down, that she'll be fine. I was still freaking out on the inside, but I pretended like I was fine, for her. We had been dating about 2 months when this all happened, and secretly, I might add (she wasn't allowed to date until she was 16 (she was 15 at the time), but had taken a liking to me, and I went for it without a second thought. He saw us holding hands once, flipped his shit, refused to meet me until about 2 months ago, we're still not allowed to date), which is pertinent to what happened next.

He likes to use me (her feelings for me, the secret relationship he knows we're having but knows he can't prove, et cetera) to emotionally torment her. Parent teacher conferences were coming up (this is towards the beginning of this school year), and he threatened to ask all relevant staff members (our teachers, campus monitors, principal, vice principal) if they've noticed anything going on between us. This freaks us out, since we are no secret around the school. So over the next couple days, I talk to each and every staff member who could possibly know anything explaining that he will be there, asking all of them what they've seen, and that if they've seen anything, things are going to get very bad for her. I could/would not go into specifics, since they are all mandatory reporters, and my girlfriend was at this point unwilling to get CPS/DHS/the police involved, for fear of what might happen (he managed to instill a few fears in her to act as safeties. Manipulative bastard). Throughout the rest of the week, I grow more and more tense, more and more stressed out, more and more anxious, I have to get this off my chest. So I go in to the counselor's office, planning to talk to my counselor anonymously, to see what I can do for my girlfriend, and just to get it off my chest.

The only person in was a counseling intern. We'll call him Tom. Since everyone was in New Orleans for the week, I decided to talk to him. Again, anonymously, just to get it off my chest. He seemed like a nice enough guy, sounded like he knew what he was talking about, I feel comfortable talking to him, so I open up a bit more than I intended to. Eventually, he convinced me to just say everything. He was confident things would be resolved in a way that would A: protect her from her stepdad, and B: protect my anonymity from her, since if she were to find out I squealed, she would shut down and never tell me anything important again, which would make it impossible to try to help her, and leave her with no one to talk to about it. Or she would just leave me. Which would have the same effect. 

This is where shit hit the fan. 
Since no one else was around, including his supervisor, who he's legally required to consult, he had to go to the next step up, to the Vice Principal. Already I didn't like where this was going. The VP was somewhat buddies with my girlfriend's abusive stepfather, although I doubt he knew of the abuse. Contrary to what you may be thinking, no, he did not betray us to him, he went to get the campus police, leaving Tom and I in Tom's office. About a half hour later, still no word from VP, so Tom leaves to see what's up. A few minutes later, he walks back in, not looking at me (I knew something was up), sits down, looks me square in the eye, and says ""You're going to hate me.""

The campus police and VP decided to take my GF out of class, drag her into their office, and interrogate her. She denies anything happened (no fucking shit) and asks if it was Mr. Derp that reported it (he was the only teacher whom we had talked to who asked questions). They said no, and revealed to her that it was me who had come to them, and proceeded to tell her about how I need to grow up (they assumed I made it up to try to get the stepdad in trouble). They released her and called me in, and upon noticing that I wasn't just your average teenage hoodlum, advised me on what to do to get the stepdad to like me. Put on a nice suit, introduce yourself, that sort of thing. It took serious willpower to sit there quietly, half smiling, pretending to absorb their utterly useless and frankly insulting advice. I was told no call had been made to DHS, and that no call was to be made. This was untrue. A call was made, and DHS decided to investigate, not the physical abuse, but the paedophile living in their basement. (a story I'll tell if anyone cares to ask). Nothing ultimately came of it.

From then up until today, she has not told me of any more abuse he's inflicted, although it's clear that he has, just that she doesn't trust me with that sort of thing anymore. Now, today, she returned from a two week long trip with her family. After the initial ""I missed you so much baby, XOXOXO"" I asked how her trip went. It went poorly. Her stepfather was abusive throughout the trip. She cited two specific instances, once this morning, when she accidentally sat on his jacket, so he pushed her into a table (hard), and yesterday, when he ""noogied"" her until she cried, then when she attempted to push him away, kicked her. This sort of thing has been happening the past three weeks. I am concerned, because his abuse is escalating, and I'm afraid of how far he'll go. Also, it sounds like she might be willing to call a hotline at some point. I have been urging her to do so, though I'm just as certain about it as she is.

What should I do? What should she do? What should I implore her to do? help."

I've been a lurker for almost a year. I guess I might need one of [these](http://danfugate.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/lurker.jpg) :D?

Anyway, I'm a student from insert-small-town-here america, and this summer I scored a sweet internship in NYC! yay! I'll be staying in a education housing like dorm in midtown east. To put it blank, I'm a little terrified. 

It will be my first time in the city, ever, and it will be all summer. Any tips for midtown/new york life? I know this question comes up a lot, and I've been searching! however I'd love some personal advice. 

I'll be carrying around a computer, iPad, and my personal dlsr. Any tips on fitting in with $$$ of gear? Thats probably my biggest worry. 

I love photography, how do new yorkers take street photography? Is whipping out a dlsr and snapping pictures as you walk down the street normal or do these photography blogs lying? 

help help help!! haha. Any places I need to check out for sure? Good places to possibly meet other interns/students in the tech world of NYC? life advice? 




**TLDR** Im a student from a small town and this is my big shot to prove myself in NYC with an internship. I'd love some life advice for the city in the summer."

Currently living in a small midwestern town; applying for work in major/minor cities (New York, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, Chicago, Savannah, Boston). 

I've sent out numerous resumes and have only heard back once about a part-time, unpaid internship position in Boston. Though primarily applying for paid internships and entry level jobs in arts-related fields, I am also applying at small but high end antiques dealers, auction houses, libraries, artist assistant positions, restoration, furniture upholstering, publishing (magazine/paper) and archive jobs that don't require an MLA/MLS. 

I can't really step out of my head enough to see if what is written on my resume is in line with a potential candidate for the prospects listed above. 

My main goal right now is simple: to move to a larger area with some kind of job (even if it's an internship).  

I know my credentials aren't mind blowing, but I'm also hoping their not embarrassing.  
Please take a look and, if you can offer any constructive criticism or advice, I would appreciate it. 

Edit: I've held seasonal jobs between the jobs listed (landscaping, gardening, and running a ski lift), but didn't think it would be of any use to add them to a resume.

I would like to watch some web shows along that vein. I like reviews and benchmarks of hardware, I like when people make new exciting builds for specific purposes (instead of the i5 2500k+evo212 cooler+8 gigs ram+560Ti build over and over and over). I love case modding.

I have never built my own computer, though i've been lusting after various components since 2005. I dont have the money to and I was in college so the only time I DID have the money to I spent it on a laptop. I feel that within the next year or two i'll get some sort of funds, probably from an internship or a ""fuck it, fast food"" job. I want to stay up to date and current on hardware.

I have recently received offers, and reduced them down to 2 offers.

First one is from a startup company in Bay Area, that has unique products (virtualization &amp; Big Data area). They offer some good perks, benefits, but they lack 401(k) plan. Instead, they will give some stock options. The salary is less than 90k, which is comparably low with respect to the living cost in San Jose. But I am sure their product is quite unique and IPO of company will get you some money from options. The office isn't really great, but people in there seems to be  smart. A lot of masters, PhD people..

and the other one Amazon in Seattle (good benefits, bonuses and ok-salary in Seattle). Large cubicle offices, wet weather compare to San Jose. Amazon seems to be growing and expanding its coverage into various areas, like clouds and services.

This is going to be the first job that I will be having. I am looking for a career rather than switching job every year. I am thinking of going for Amazon, but I cannot decide for sure. Because I do not have any previous intern experiences nor have never lived in San Jose, and Seattle. 

Any recommendations for this choice?

Would it be helpful to build up my experiences in Amazon and then jump into Bay Area some day later? Or would it be better idea to risk little bit for startup and start my career in Bay Area? (although I think this startup will have no problem in funding and IPO, since their product is solid and unique)

I'm also taking education classes towards earning a single subject credential. My advisor told me about a 12 month program at the school where I can receive a Master's degree, and I was wondering if it would be worth staying there for a while longer to get one.

My original gameplan was to just get my BA and a credential. I wantto use my BA and CBEST certification to start substituting and gaining experience until I land a teaching job. But now that I see getting a Master's in Education as a potential option, I'm debating whether or not I should continue and take that route. 

People, friends, professors, and colleagues have told me things such as:

* A Master's is the new Bachelor's.
* A Master's in Education looks better than a Master's in English if you already have a BA in English
* The 12 month program gives you a paid internship or residency program where you can use the experience in your classes for your Master's project.
* You need to take into account how much you'll be paid with a BA and a Master's and weight the differences
* Other things that had to do with pros and cons of going to graduate school for a Master's vs. entering the teaching world with a BA in English

I don't know, I'm at a crossroads right now. I just need some kind of guidance from fellow teachers who have probably thought about or have taken this route in their career.

**tl;dr Will it be worth investing more time and money into pursuing a Master's in Education?**

I don’t know if I will ever be able to go back. I don’t know if I just have an over active imagination, but what I do know is there is a gash on my arm from whatever it was.

I had just started an internship with an engineering company in just outside of Detroit Michigan. I was more concerned about break-ins and muggings than anything when I moved into the rented room of the small white house in a very nice old gated community about fifteen minutes from the down town. I knew something was wrong when I asked my land lord why he was renting the house out. He said that his daughter wouldn’t stay there anymore. I didn’t want to ask anymore, because I assumed they were just fighting, and I am not the best at consoling people being a very quiet and shy guy.

I moved in about a week ago. The weather was great for March. The sun was shining and there was not a sign of snow anywhere. After I had set up my TV and settled into my room it seemed like things couldn’t get any better. I was out on my own in a nice house all by myself. I knew that my house mates wouldn’t be moving in for another week. I felt great, but then night came and the scrapping started.

I remember I was watching television and I didn’t really notice the sun setting and the darkness filling the room. I was dossing off when I first heard it, but the sound sure as hell woke me up. It was a scraping worse than nails on a chalk board. It was like a rusty blade slowly cutting through a human chalk board that was screaming out in pain.  The sound would persist for a second and then go away for just long enough to think it had gone away forever, but it always came back. 

As an engineer I tend to be a rational person, which is why I didn’t GTFO as soon as possible. Instead I searched around for what the sound could be. I looked out the window and saw nothing going on outside. I looked in the closet and around the room, but found nothing. That’s when I noticed that as I got closer to the radiator it got louder. I put my ear up close to the radiator and realized that the sound was resenting from it. I decided that I should check the boiler.

I am not the bravest of men, so I lit ever single light I could on my way to the basement. At the top of the landing I looked down. It was a dusty room with cement floors and what appeared to be a work bench all around the small room. The only light was a pull string bare bulb at the bottom of the landing. I could hear the sound grow as I opened the basement door, and I knew it was coming from down there. I took carful steps down the bare wood steps quietly listening to the screech when I saw what I am now convinced is a bench grinder and sparks flying from it every time there was a screech. I moved closer thinking that somehow it had turned on and a piece of metal was nocking agents it, but then I got a closer look at what was rubbing against the grinder.

It appeared to be a large machete floating in air and rubbing its self on the blade. Like some unseen person was sharpening his weapon. I thought my eyes must be playing a trick on me, so I slowly pulled the pull string for the light. Immediately I heard a loud raspy, “WHAT!” and saw the blade spin around as if the invisible holder turned to face me. I barely had time to react as the blade came towards me it swayed back and forth as it crossed the floor. My mind was telling me run, but my legs were frozen in fear. I was only able to move just as the blade was raised in the air. I had time to put my forearm in front of my face before the blade struck. I fell to the ground in a heap. I was frozen sprawled out on the ground blood gushing from the gash in my arm. I saw the machete lower like the invisible man was kneeling to take a look at his victim. I held my breath as I felt the warm air of the attacker on my neck as he surveyed his work. 

It stood up and I saw the blade bob up and down as it walked up the stairs. The door slammed and there was silence. I don’t know how long I lay there, but after what felt like hours I slowly lifted myself to my feet. I slowly crept up the step and poked my head slowly out of the door. All the lights I had turned on were out. The blade was resting on the kitchen counter with my blood still on it. I, still trying to be rational, crept out to try and grab the blade to make sense of it all. I had just put my hand on the blade when I heard the voice again, “How many fucking times do I have to tell you! THAT’S DADDY’S!” I ran as fast as I could out of there. 

Needless to say I need a new place to stay.

Although i know i'll be long-winded. i apologize for that. if any more context is need, please let me know and i'll gladly oblige :)

*Brief description of her: Both mid twenties. She's shy, reserved and a bit nerdy. Takes watching movies any day over going clubbing. I really dig this type and has a very cool personality.* 


(this entire storywill sound like high school drama. includes a lot on texting and he/she said. This is mostly due to her being close to finishing her major and having to days-long internship shifts.)


Anyway, So i was once greeting this female friend and met her cousin who was with her group. I tell my friend afterwards i thought she was pretty cute and she tells me her cousin's feelings were mutual but she had a boyfriend at the time but they were not doing well. She tells me to add her on facebook anyway. She even told me she had told her cousin and she liked the idea as well. 

I do so and we start chatting and getting along. About a week after, she barely seemed interested in talking,  (barely replying and taking a long time to do so). needless to say, the conversations weren't as engaging as before, so i took the hint and moved on with my life.


A couple months after, she starts messaging me again, so we sort of re-established connection. My friend, her cousin, started telling me that it's because she didn't want to do anything out of respect for the relationship she was still in, but that was finally over. 'okay, what the hell, i still find her cute', but i was wary because how past events turned out going.  
About a week after she invites me over for a movie night with her friends at her house (My friend was going to be there so it didn't feel like a big deal at all). It was the first time i saw her in person other than the meeting day, it was fun. After that, we sort of lost contact. Things began going the same way as before again. I thought i had blown it or she didn't find me as appealing or something but oh well, again, i moved on. We occasionally had random 30 minute chats every couple of months but that was it.


Months after (last week) i was randomly chatting with my friend and the topic of her cousin sort of pops up. She starts telling me that she was into me and thought that *i* wasn't, that she thought she was the one that had done something to scare me away... wtf? she was the one that slowed down on the talking and showed increasing disinterest each time. I correct her and she sorta arranged this movie night in which she invited both me and her, to sort of get back in touch. Oh well, what the hell.


So that happened last friday, everyone had fun. it was all good. on saturday we start chatting and thought to myself 'fuck it, i'm going to be a bit more forward because there's nothing to lose'. So i asked her out. She already had plans but we arranged to go out on sunday but she asked if it was cool if she told her cousin (my friend) to tag along. There was nothing else to say but 'sure'...

So thinking about a casual day, we go to the carnival and all seemed to have had a very good time. we had a nice conversation after i dropped her off at her place. had an alright quick casual exchange on monday but as predicted, the same thing is happening again.

We've been playing  draw something and wordfeud matches but that's the most personal we've gotten. other than the casual game comments. 

I've no idea where i'm standing, or if this is a game (a very childish one), or if that she's that dense or that there's something i'm not observing here.  I can't be upfront at all because i'm not (never been) in the position to be. I know most of the replies will consist on ""don't waste your time. leave"" and you'd probably be right. I just want to make sure there's absolutely no reason to be there. I'm not losing this sleep over this or anything like that, but i do believe she's a very nice girl and it'd be a shame to pass on something good because signals were being misread or anything like that. What do you guys think and what should my future steps be?

rif4l,1,2012-03-28,"Interview for my ideal job tomorrow, looking for advice on how to nail it!",Shtriiganu,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rif4l/interview_for_my_ideal_job_tomorrow_looking_for/,"I have an interview tomorrow for a Public Relations Coordinator position for a Veterinary Hospital. I have been looking for a job like this since I graduated last May with a degree in PR. I finally have an interview for it and I want to make sure I present myself as well as I can.

Here is my dilemma: I have experience doing all of the job's qualifications while I was in school, but many of them I don't have ""real world"" experience in, such as event planning, developing media relationships, outreach campaigns, and acting as the point of contact for media inquiries.

While these are all things that I desire to do and have had ""experience"" with in school, how do I address this? They don't specifically list that experience is required, but I know that it would be helpful if I have a way to address it. I did work during an internship writing press releases and developing content for the web and I am currently volunteering with an organization where I am developing some relationships with local community members.

While I was in school I developed a crisis communication plan for a local company, which they have adopted as their company crisis plan. I am planning on taking this along to my interview and leaving them a copy to look over after my interview (it's more than 20 pages, so way too much to explain during a normal interview). I feel that this plan that I created shows what I am capable of even though I don't have a large amount of work experience.

Is there anything else anyone can suggest? I would love this job because it combines maintaining and improving the company's reputation through Public Relations practices and the atmosphere of a veterinary hospital that has the same values and ideals that I do as an individual. 

Thank you for any suggestions you can provide. "

I'm a high school student who is about to complete AP Physics, and I'm looking for something to do next year as a senior (or during the summer). I cannot take any more physics courses. I can self-study, but I don't think I would be productive. What I would really like is to get an internship.

I was wondering what fields of physics would be open to me as an intern. I don't know any physics beyond AP, but I have a moderate computer science background and a very strong math background. If it helps, I live in New York City. My teachers are all very encouraging but seem to be at a loss as to how exactly I would be of use to a researcher.

Thank you!

EDIT: I realize people are trying to be helpful, but you haven't told me anything I don't know. What field can I even begin to look in? I am planning on speaking with professors, but I don't want to approach every single person. It would help to narrow them down somewhat, and also to have some measure of confidence in my usefulness. Even if I can't get an internship, it would be interesting to know what modern physics is accessible to me now.

I also mentioned I have a strong background in math. To clarify: unless a string theorist takes me on, there probably won't be any math I don't know in whatever physics I do. I'm not bragging (well, maybe a little?) but I want to explain my situation clearly."

I am a business major at a great school, looking to go into consulting in two years, I'm a sophomore going into junior year. I had an internship lined up for this summer but it got messed up and now I'm out of luck. I love traveling and suddenly two and a half months show up out of nowhere with no responsibilities. 


So enough of that crap, I want to travel! I have been lucky enough to live in Paris for a large part of my life, and have traveled Europe extensively. I want to go somewhere that I can live decently for a month or two on 2,500. Where? 


I am fine roughing it a bit, but hitchhiking and couchsurfing are out of the picture, hostels are fine. I hate the cold, and if a beach was nearby I would be a happy man, maybe the happiest in the world if there's a good wave too. 


I will be in Nicaragua for all of next month, maybe getting a base of spanish, I am conversational in french. I am an adventurous person, I want a little bit of everything in my journey. A relaxed government on consumption of... anything.... would be preferable to an authoritarian state that would kill me for looking at r/trees.

rlgvi,1,2012-03-30,Long Distance Problems,LongDistanceFake,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/rlgvi/long_distance_problems/,"I've been dating my girlfriend for over a year and half, mostly long distance. We go to different colleges, and live near each other during the summer. She has a lot of great qualities, but she's always been very jealous and needy. Her mom loves me and has called me a saint for having to deal with her daughter. However, we did break up once because her jealousy and neediness got too much. She got mad at me for hanging out with friends, refused to allow me to drink, would start huge fights if I ever went out at night, so I ended it last March. We eventually got back together in May, with promises that she would be better.

It was better for awhile, but has gotten worse. She is still jealous, hates me meeting new people, etc. I go out once a week and that still usually causes a fight, because she needs to call me before bed every night and wants me to be home by when she goes to bed, which is usually very early. It's better when we are home, but even then she is very high maintenance. Basically, I feel extremely stressed out constantly by having to please her and if I make one mistake, it's a fight where everything is my fault.

Here's my current problem: I used to get chest pains as a child because I had a bad childhood. I got my life together and it got better, though was never diagnosed. Around November last year, they came back. Sharp pains and soreness everytime I was stressed. I saw multiple doctors over my winter break, got an EKG and other tests, and all they could say was it was related to stress(Which I told them) and I should either be less stressed or go on anti-anxiety meds. It went away for awhile, so I was happy.

But now it's come back these past 2 weeks. At first I thought it was just my internship search, but I am done with that now with a dream internship, so I should be happy. But my chest is still brutally hurting, it feels like a knife sliding in to my chest. My only thought is that it is related to my girlfriend. Whenever we fight, which is probably a lot more than it should be, it gets worse. And it just hurts in general, even when we don't. I don't know what to do. She is aware of the problem as well.

I am not positive it is all her, but it has a strong correlation to hurting when we fight and issues with her. I'm not stressed about school or anything else. Can anybody give me advice here? I'm completely lost. I do love her, and she has a lot of great qualities, but I think the relationship might be the cause of my chest pain."

*COPIED OUT OF CREEPY PASTA FOR MORE VIEWS THERE*


Red Mist is a controversial real-life bootleg tape featuring an unaired episode of Spongebob Squarepants. Like the long-lost but recently discovered ""Suicide Mouse"" tape, Red Mist was purportedly created by a now imprisoned Scottish animator for the series who intended to pass the tape off as the season four premiere episode and featured the death of Squidward.

DESCRIPTION OF TAPE
*warning tape is desturbing*
     Red Mist begins with Squidward preparing to practice his clarinet in his room as Spongebob and Patrick play merrily outside. Squidward wraps his mouth around the clarinet and is only able to play one note before being interrupted by someone knocking on the door. He walks down and opens the door and discovers that a traveling salesman is at his door. The salesman, a Scottish fish, asks if he could have a moment of Squidward's time. Squidward tells him that he isn't interested and slams the door in the man's face, walking back to his room. The salesman begins knocking again, and Squidward opens the door angrily. The salesman, looking very upset, tells Squidward that ""the red mist is coming"" and precedes to walk off, confusing Squidward. Squidward walks back to his room and finally begins playing the clarinet. After performing several off-key notes, Spongebob and Patrick begin laughing outside, interrupting Squidward yet again. Squidward walks over to the window and shouts at the two, telling them he needs to practice for a concert he will be performing at. Spongebob and Patrick apologize with tears in their eyes and walk back to their houses. Squidward, unsure of himself, walks back over and begins playing his clarinet again, this time uninterrupted. The scene then fades to red over the course of twelve seconds.

     Perhaps by glitch, the same scene is repeated once more which is somewhat common in rough cuts of animation. However, this time, the eyes have been replaced with new, more realistic eyes with red pupils, clearly not real but more realistic than CGI or animated. The audio is also completely absent from this scene, save for occasional clicks. 

After the repeat of the previous scene, a new scene begins with the same red eyes, but at the theater where Squidward is playing his clarinet. The frames in the animation skip every four seconds, but the sound remains synced. After an unruly performance of a song he dubbed ""Red Mist"", Spongebob and Patrick are seen in the crowd booing Squidward, very uncommon for them. The scene pans to reveal the same Scottish salesman sitting next to them, also booing, as Squidward walks back to his home with his head in his tentacles. What's odd is that the scene actually shows him walking to his house, with nothing happening in the background, for three minutes and fifty seconds before abruptly cutting to red for another twenty seconds, just as he arrives at his house. 

A new scene appears, back to the original cartoon eyes, with Squidward sitting in a chair in his room that night, with a blank look on his face for roughly thirty seconds before starting to sob softly. Again, the audio is completely missing for most of the scene, until the sobbing begins. This is when the sound of a slight

breeze through a forest can be heard in the background. It also begins very mildly zooming in on Squidward's face, only noticeable if you compare ten seconds of frames side by side. The sound of him sobbing can suddenly be heard, very loudly and severe as the screen twitches in on itself briefly. The salesman's laughing can also be heard echoing in the background.

After another thirty seconds, the screen blurs and twitches violently and a single frame flashes over the screen. Upon pausing it exactly on the frame, the viewer can see a real-life photo of a deceased six year-old boy laying in the forest in his underwear, whose face has been mangled, eye has been popped, and stomach cut open with entrails laying beside him. Next to him, the shadow of the photographer is clearly visible with part of the photographer's hand appearing to the right of the screen. 

After this photograph is seen, it cuts back to Squidward sobbing, much louder than before with what appears to be blood running from his eyes instead of tears and the sound of the salesman still heard. The sound of the wind in the forest is also played at a much louder volume, but now with the sound of branches snapping and the screams of a young boy heard. After twenty more seconds, another single frame appears, this time of an eight year-old girl in the forest laying on her stomach in a pool of blood, with her back cut open and entrails piled on top. The shadow of the photographer is also visible. 

The scene reverts back to Squidward, now with the same realistic red eyes from before, completely silent and no longer sobbing. The sound of the forest can no longer be heard. Another three seconds later and it cuts back to the sobbing, this time piercing loud and with the sound of the forest heard. The screams of both a young boy and young girl can be heard mixed together as the song ""Amazing Grace"" plays on both the clarinet and the
bagpipes. During this, seven frames are seen in black and white of the boy from the first photograph laying in the woods. Over the course of the seven frames, the hand of the photographer reaches in and grabs the boy's entrails, as his remaining eye focuses on the man's hand and even blinks once. 

This cuts back to Squidward again, this time staring at the viewer as the sound of the salesman echoes ""DO IT"" and ""the red mist is coming"" repeatedly. After forty seconds of this, the camera quickly pans out to reveal Squidward holding a realistic gun, looking as though it were Photoshopped into the scene. Squidward lifts the barrel into his mouth and fires, with blood shooting out from his head and then the screen cut to static. 

DELIVERY OF THE TAPE
On November 7, 2004, after the initial animation of the storyboards were completed in Fife, Scotland, the tape was delivered to the lead animators and sound editors at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, California during the middle of the night. The tape was taken into the editing room where it was watched by said animators and editors, as well as two sixteen year-old interns. The tape, which was supposed to feature the rough cut of ""Fear of a Krabby Patty"", instead began with a title card using the name ""Red Mist"". While thrown off at first, the animators continued watching, discovering the tape had been heavily tampered with as some sort of cruel joke. 

As a result, three animators (Barry O'Neill, Grant Kirkland, Jr. and Alyssa Simpson) were sent to the hospital, one editor retired (Fernando de la Peña) and one intern (Jackie McMullen) committed suicide. The tape was sent to the police, who determined that it had been made by Andrew Skinner, a disgruntled animator from Fife, Scotland, who has since been charged with nine counts of murder, including the murder of the two children seen in the tape. Oddly enough, after going through the data on the VHS, police discovered that the last edit to the tape had been made exactly twenty four seconds before it was watched by the Spongebob staff.

One copy of the tape was made (before police confiscated the original) by Chaz Agnew, writer of this article and the sole surviving intern from that night. Agnew has made various attempts to distribute copies of Skinner's tape and hopes to secure clearance rights to release it on several online auction websites soon.

I have currently acquired a position as a lab intern under a professor of mine for the summer. He deals mostly with bio/nano chem and lots of membranes and microfluidic stuff.

I got an interview offer from private lab. I honestly have no idea what they do (nonlinear ion dynamics?) and how it relates to ChE, but they've viewed my resume and apparently like it. 

The private position is very unideal (long commute, unpaid). The university lab is on campus (I can easily get money from my school for summer housing, but not for housing off campus), and paid. 

I have a couple of issues. First, to me, the private lab just SOUNDS like a better networking opportunity. What do you guys think about that?

Second, I haven't officially said I'll take the internship, but I said I currently have no commitments for the summer and that I was available to work as soon as the summer semester began. Would it look bad for me to back out if I got the other position?

I am a recent graduate from a Civil Engineering (MEng) course from a University in London (based there as well); 

Prior to university I didn't know anything about code or the process behind programming, as soon I was introduced to my first programming module (simple mathsy stuff in MATLAB), I realised that I liked solving problems computationally and would work a lot harder on these modules than on anything else. If I had had enough confidence in my decisions I would have tried to change to a Comp Sci course but I persisted and completed my MEng in Civil, however I always picked modules and my dissertation theme on the more computational side of things.

Since a lot of my fellow students (and I assume to some extent the industry) were really averse to programming; I thought I would find a niche as being a more computationally inclined Civil Engineer; however I soon realised I was totally uninspired by a lot of what you would call the ""bread and butter"" of Civil Engineering, so I never really sought out to involve myself with anything that would further a career in Civil Engineering, even my dissertation was more about bio mechanics.

In my last year of uni, I ended up helping a designer friend code some actionScript for a Flash Website Uni project and I started doing the programming for his web design clients. This then lead me to an internship with a small digital marketing company; initially for a general job. I then immediately found away of saving them money by custom building a lot of web applications they were paying for monthly and in the process learning new, more useful web languages; javascript, php, ruby, sql .. etc. 

They then hired me full time, for a very basic wage,  to create them a suite of web apps they could sell to their customers (much of the suite being my own ideas as to what their customers would want); So I did this in about 6 months, it turned out to be popular among their clients, opening up a completely new revenue stream for them. 

But i decided to leave because a) I didn't want to be the only technical guy in a non-technical company and b) even though i was very grateful that they allowed me to trial my own ideas and learn a lot in the process, I didn't really agree in their business model (it relied heavily on using ""social media"") and c) I had never planned for this to be a long-term commitment and I wasn't particularly happy there. They convinced me to stay on as a ""freelance consultant"" while I looked for another job.     

Up to recently I was convinced I would try to get graduate programs in Engineering or Consultancy or even Finance (*shudder*) but I was seriously uninspired until I had a revelation and realised that at every career/university choice I had always elected to do something where I could code to solve a problem. So why not try to go into Software Development or something similar?

So my questions are: 

How much does it matter if I don't have a Comp Sci degree when applying to serious software/technology jobs? 
Based on what limited experience I have would I ever be seriously considered?
What is the best way to demonstrate (or even find out if I have) ability in this area?

rl8pe,1,2012-03-30,Info on SMART Fellowship,jmblock2,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/rl8pe/info_on_smart_fellowship/,"Hey everyone,

I'm curious if anyone out there in the ether is currently under the SMART ~~fellowship~~ scholarship. Just found out I got accepted to a lab but haven't received the letter yet, denied by the NSF, and haven't heard from the NDSEG yet.

I know the program covers tuition. I'm curious about the stipend. It says 25-41k. It also says summer internships, but from what it sounds like the summer internships are included in the stipend total already. There there is also the having to work for the lab X number of years you get the stipend.

I'm a bit torn because I've been crazy lucky so far. I am a graduating MS student and now a PhD student in EE. I've had a combo TA/RA for the last 2 years. Just got married in December, so that's a huge piece my wife and I need to figure out.

So I guess I'm just looking for anyone with experience with the program and if they found it fulfilling, or how you felt when the obligation comes up after finishing your degree. Are the summer internships included in the 41k stipend and are you pretty much guaranteed to get the 41k being a PhD?

Thanks, and I realize most of this will probably be explained to me when I get the official notice, but I'm a bit obsessive about planning.

**edit** oops should be scholarship"
rl7vr,5,2012-03-30,Northeastern v. Uconn,Bujie_Smalls,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/rl7vr/northeastern_v_uconn/,"So my top choices for school next fall are northeastern university or uconn honors for mechanical engineering. Looking past everything such as being in storrs or being in Boston. Or even the co-op program at northeastern, which would reddit consider to be the better engineering program?

Also, I assume I'd be doing internships or co-ops at uconn but would having a structured plan for them be more beneficial?

Tl;dr Uconn honors vs. northeastern mechanical engineering?"
rl0kc,11,2012-03-30,Now I have a question - Working the broiler.,Kwaurtz,AskCulinary,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/rl0kc/now_i_have_a_question_working_the_broiler/,"Alright, so I've been working saute in my current job, worked saute mostly for my internship, and I did mostly sauteing when I was in Culinary school. I knew that this would eventually be my downfall in terms of other stations, but now I've started training on the broiler at work (For some background info - I work in a AAA five diamond, USDA-prime steakhouse). The broiler is the one station that I sort of 'dread'.

The reason I find it harder to work broiler at the current place is because the steak's are either huge cuts, or filet's, and everything is hit by a jacard as soon as the ticket is printed. The meat is always squishy, and that makes it hard to do the palm feel test, and I'm not puncturing it with a probe thermometer.

So now - What would be the best way to go about this? I'll go to KC if need be, but I was hoping that those of you whom have worked in professional kitchens would have an answer here.

Our steaks -

* 8 oz. Filet
* 12 oz. Filet
* 14 oz. Strip
* 16 oz. Rib-eye
* 24 oz. Porterhouse
* 12 oz. Veal porterhouse"

I just switched from Computer Science / Math to Biotech/Pre-Professional/Math. I realized that I hated programming, and would never enjoy a future in it, so I went to one of my other dreams in life; becoming a surgeon. 

To be frank, my GPA isn't good right now (because I've been taking courses that I absolutely hated). However, in my junior and senior years, I'll only be taking classes I find interesting (physics, biotech, anatomy, orgo chem, etc...), so I'll definitely have the motivation to get the best possible grades. 

Assuming that I get good marks on my MCAT, have plenty of shadowing, hospital volunteer work, and internships, and get excellent grades after switching majors, will I have a chance of getting into medical school?

rkvum,16,2012-03-30,Living in Finland as a Brit...,christorb,Finland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/rkvum/living_in_finland_as_a_brit/,"Moi!

OK, so I have a wonderful Finnish wife who lives with me in the UK. Job-wise, things aren't exactly working out for us that well in England, so we've been briefly talking about the possibility of moving to Finland. I was just wondering if it'd be possible for me to get any kind of decent career over there, as I know very very little Finnish! Just so you know, I have a 1st class degree in Audio and Music Technology, and have been planning to take a masters degree in Environmental Acoustics - my dream job is to be an acoustic consultant - but it's looking unlikely that we'll be able to afford for me to do the masters in the UK.

My wife tells me that there are good internship schemes in Finland, so I'll be looking into that too, though I have my reservations as to whether I'd be able to get an internship because of the language.

I'll be doing my own research on this naturally as well, but redditors can often be very helpful with these kinds of things :)"

We don't have a ""live audience"", can't afford it (yet), so we have interns and the same dedicated staff of ""flaughers"" (fake laughers) show after show. To be honest, without them, the show wouldn't be worth doing. Genuinely cracking them up is what I live for on a daily basis. I genuinely crack them up about once a week... but I'm getting better!

Any other input would be welcome and appreciated as well.


*Clouded Specifics*

I have taken the GRE for Grad School and received fairly good scores, am certified as an EIT via the FE (only had to take it once), but what is ultimately holding me back from any set decision is a lack of focused passion in any particular direction. Some other factors that way heavily on my mind is the lack of internship experience and a GPA that is below 3.0 (Liberal arts school and showed below par my first two years)

rkc8z,0,2012-03-29,How do front-end engineers stack up?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rkc8z/how_do_frontend_engineers_stack_up/,"Hey everyone,

I've got a bunch of questions about front-end [web] engineering.

**Background:**

I started making simple websites when I was ten. When I was twelve, I started learning HTML/CSS. For a while, I made static websites and concentrated a lot on learning design, since I originally wanted to be a web designer. Eventually, I realized that I was much more of a programmer than a designer, so I chose computer science as my major when I started college.

**Now**

I'm now finishing up my junior year of college. Computer science is awesome, and I've learned a whole lot, especially about web development. I had two jobs last summer doing web development, and I've participated in a bunch of hackathons. I've also been the webmaster of a few organizations here at my school. Because of my experience Photoshopping and web designing, my friends usually ask me to be the front-end developer in projects that I'm involved in. In my group of friends, I'm know as ""the front-end guy."" However, I consider myself an ""end-to-end"" web developer, since I'm just as comfortable with the back-ends of websites. It just so happens that I'm the best front-end developer out of my group of friends, so that's what I get stuck doing most of the time.

As of now, I've *literally* applied for thirty summer internships. Out of those, I've either been denied or ignored by at least 23 of them (waiting on the rest). These applications were all for software engineering internship positions. I'm definitely not dumb, and while my GPA isn't stellar (3.35, mostly due to one bad semester freshman year), it's not the worst in the world.

I've been interviewing with one company recently for a front-end engineering position, and I'm pretty sure that I'm going to get it. It's going to deal a lot with data visualization in JavaScript, which I think would be cool (and the company is awesome), but it still bothers me that there's a chance that my only offer for this summer will be for a front-end position.

**Questions**

1. Do I have any reason to feel like front-end engineering isn't as prestigious/difficult as other types software engineering?
2. Will taking a front-end engineering internship ruin my chances at becoming a non-front-end software engineer later in life, even if most of my job will consist of data visualization (as opposed to putting divs in the right spots)?
3. On average, is a front-end engineer as valuable as a non-front-end software engineer?
4. In your experience, how do front-end engineers stack up against other software engineers in terms of programming ability? (I have this strange feeling that people consider front-end engineers not much better than designers at programming).
5. I admit that I've had a few bad interviews, but I've also had some pretty good ones. My friends and I are amazed that I've been denied from so many places. Is there a good chance that I haven't received another internship offer because companies think that someone who's worked so much on the front-end doesn't have the skill to work behind the scenes?

Thanks,
Gerard

tl;dr - Do people think I'm a sucky developer because of my experience doing front-end web development?"

Thanks for the suggestions! I really appreciate it. I actually spent most of the day volunteering at a robotics competition, so I'm beyond tired. I'll try out some of the changes tomorrow, when I have more energy, and I'll post again here.

**Edit 2:**

Here is an updated version using some of the changes recommended.

*Removed*

**Edit 3:**
Holy cow, I looked at the number of views on my first resume. 202 times! Good thing I removed my personal information. Although, if someone really wanted to find out who I was, it wouldn't take much time to find it."

I applied for for the masters program at UofT in English. I am a UofT student and I didn't apply to other masters programs. 
Anyway, I didn't get in. I didn't apply for anything else- I basically have a year off. 
I am currently studying for my LSAT, am graduating in June and also considering teachers' college. 
I will be graduating with an English specialist Bachelors degree. 

I need some advice. I have good marks (around a 3.5 GPA), I've done a lot of volunteering (The Varsity, The Muslim Voice, Pakistani Development Foundation, Model UN, Multi Faith Centre Intern etc)

But I want to explore other options. I do ultimately want to get into a profession. But I really, sorely, regret doing a degree in English as it seems there's just not a lot open to me with just my undergraduate degree. 

I'm feeling pretty low at the moment. Sigh. Just need some advice really...

thanks."
rmv1p,1,2012-03-31,Would like to get an internship in Controlling / Accounting - how to get there?,new_acc_for_internsh,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/rmv1p/would_like_to_get_an_internship_in_controlling/,"**TL;DR** I want to get an internship in the field of In-House Consulting and/or Controlling, but already know I am not a good match. What can I do? (Location: Germany)



Hello,

I want to do an internship in one of the following fields:

* Controlling
* In-house Consulting
* Central (or “Corporate”?) Accounting

I really do not know what kind of application I could submit to the companies that are in this field.

**REASONS**

I want this internship for two reasons:

**1.** Due to my interest in dealing with my understanding of it: Analyzing info (or also, “numbers”) and providing clarity about business transactions, by which I mean diving into a system of information, pulling data, sifting through it, do some analyzing¬–not only with Excel–and then using the brain to talk about it from some different POVs, consult with people who worked on it … [insert other tasks] …. and then, in the end, consult [whoever it is you are doing the decision support for].

That my broad idea of it. This gets me intrigued. Not jumping on a table and screaming crazy, but intrigued.

**2.** The other stuff in my studies does not get me intrigued. The other stuff is of course out of my other major–the field of General Mechanical Engineering. Additionally, the traditional stuff in terms of Production &amp; Logistics (“production plants”). I know what it’s like to work in that field as I worked already on an assembly line for 10 weeks in a production plant and did 2 technical internships in the realm of said plant. So the second reason is: I already got “some” experience in that field.

**BACKGROUND**

I had to choose 2 majors; one of them is Controlling &amp; Audit &amp; Assurance. This major consists of 4 sub-lectures I could write about and so on. But I know, there are whole studies as a sub-topic in Accounting.
The first 3 years of my time at university, technically speaking, I did study, but I did not perform well at all. I should have taken another road, like a work-study program. Now, things got a little bit better and …  I could go on and on, but I think that’s enough for now. I’ll gladly reply to questions and add the info necessary."
rmub1,1,2012-03-31,[m4f][22][Baltimore Area] Looking for new friends and dating opportunities,Ichabod495,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/rmub1/m4f22baltimore_area_looking_for_new_friends_and/,"I'm 22 years old working on my history major at UMBC but I'm considering taking a year off to intern at an organic farm. I'm huge into new ideas and experiences. I love books, movies, good TV, and long walks on the beach. I'm also completely horrible at writing these random summary things online so bear with me.

I'm pretty down to earth but I can also be horrendously stubborn and impractical. I have a bad habit of doggedly refusing to change my mind and then suddenly pulling a 180 when I examine all the evidence myself.

I love to debate and can't understand not being able to see things from all sides. I will often play devils advocate in arguments just to try and help other people understand both sides of an argument. I'm very well spoken, except for when I forget words, and I argue primarily from reason and not emotion. I can sometimes forget that other people aren't necessarily interested in my view on every detail because I'm genuinely interested in hearing as many opinions as possible.

Looking for a long term partner and anybody who'd be fun to hang around. I'm definitely not looking for casual sex but a short fling could be fun. I'm pretty upfront about what I'm looking for in a relationship so send me a message if you're curious."

rmdct,9,2012-03-31,18 years old with credit card debt. Need some reassurance/advice here?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/rmdct/18_years_old_with_credit_card_debt_need_some/,"So my situation isn't very bad, but I am still freaked out by the fact that I will be accumulating interest on my student credit card once the APR goes from 0% to 16% next month.

Basically, I had my first internship last summer and I earned a good deal of money, $12,000. I really didn't want my parents to have to be sending me money during the school year for my soph. year so I made them a promise that I would pay all my bills, utilities, food expenses, books, health costs ETC. and only take out loans for tuition. 

Of course, over the summer I was extremely naive and ate out alot, got a ton of new clothes, bought tech toys, and didn't budget properly at all. This was also the case first semester of school because I started mindlessly using that first credit card, and it screwed me up. I have since then bought a couple of things that I shouldn't have, like a tablet PC and a bicycle to get my classes faster, but I actually have a budget... In addition, I underestimated my monthly costs like crazy, so I ended up having to get 2 credit cards. I have one card with $3K on it, whose APR will shoot up from 0% to 16% when I have to pay off the month of June in July. The other card that I am using has $1200, and has an APR of 10% for another 11 months.

I currently have a job that pays me $13.50 an hour and I can work a max of 20 hours a week (it is research, so hours are flexible) until the end of May, where I go to my internship starting June, where I will be getting paid $31/hr and definitely working 40 hours a week. 

My monthly expenses, budgetting in bills, rent, food, travel, and credit card minimum payments add up to $700 a month, which has all been going on this other card that I have.

I really want to be able to pay off these cards as fast as I can, however I need to focus on doing well in school, but I know I can't just ignore the debt right now. I guess I sort of need an action plan/advice as to how many hours I should force myself to do my research work in addition to my huge courseload in order to feel that I am working towards eliminating my debt as fast as possible?

Should I be worried here? I guess my goals here are really to A: figure out if I need to be doing more research assistance stuff to get the money faster, B: If my new budget is realistic enough, C: a good plan for if I should buy something that I feel would help me improve efficiency (like a bicycle) or if I should try and save as much as possible....


My budget:

Rent - 313$/m
Internet - 22.5$/m
Water - 15$/m
Heat/Elec - 40$/m

Food
Groceries - $120/m

Travel (going home to visit my family)
Bus or Train - $50/m

Misc expenses (shampoo, hygiene, notebooks, etc.) - $50/m

Paying off cards bit by bit - $100/m right now, will increase to $1000 once I am at my internship (is the plan)

My income:

I've been treating one of my credit cards as temporary income until my new job up until this point. BUT I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE! But judging by the responses I just need to put both of my credit cards away

It has $1400

I have $410 in the bank currently which will be going to my rent and utilities, I will also be getting a paycheck for like $150 dollars too.

My income is like this:

I get more work to do as I make myself available to my group. I want to make myself more available but I am extremely paranoid I will be stuck working and get behind in my classes, so I haven't been working nearly as much as I should have been for the past 3 weeks with midterms and such. 

Usually I would do 12 hours a week, which would bring in $600 a month. I haven't been accumulating any more debt since december, and I've been able to sustain myself for a while with this extra card helping me when I couldn't work for a week or had too much homework to do. I'm an electrical engineer at really difficult school, so I have quite a bit of school work do be doing. (thus the insane internship).  

But I feel I should be working more. Now I know I cannot rely on my cards for anything and I need to make sure to be working more to pay them off faster? I don't know... :(


Also the internship goes into the fall semester (8 months) that's why I was trying to go easy on myself with working... It is a very hacky plan though, and I need to understand better habits.


EDIT 2: I decided that I'm going to put away the cards and be extremely frugal for the next few months until I get to my new job, where I'll just pay the cards off immediately. According to my calculations I won't have more than $100 dollars of interest as long as I pay them off within 3 months of having my job. I think this is the best option for me at this point.

rm4df,0,2012-03-31,Gaming the Mega Million Lotto: Is it possible to buy every single combination? Read my hypothetical scenario,secular_humanist,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rm4df/gaming_the_mega_million_lotto_is_it_possible_to/,"
The Jackpot is now 640 million.Now imagine this scenario:

You are the manager of a Hedge Fund with over a billion dollars to invest. You set aside $175,711,536 to buy every single lottery ticket combination.If you can not buy them electronically and have to buy them in cash, here is what you do:

Assuming it takes an average of 5 minutes to fill out a lottery form, it will take 14.6 million MAN HOURS to buy all the tickets.

You have 3 days to buy the tickets. 7-11 Stores are open 16 hours a day. If you hire people to spend 16 hours for three days buying lottery tickets, each worker will provide 72 man hours. With 14.6 million man hours, you will need to hire about 204,000 workers to buy tickets under your Hedge Fund’s name.The minimum wage in my state is $7.25, BUT this is a task that has a slim margin of error for mistakes. It would not be advisable to assign this task to minimum wage labor. Instead, you could hire 204,000 college students and pay them $15 per hour (A decent salary for a college intern). For 14.6 million manhours, that would cost: $220 million. 

Add to that the cost of the tickets: $176 million. The result is: $396 million.

Now, suppose the payout is: $640 million. With 30% tax, that results in you taking home: $441 million. 

The NET PROFIT is: $ 45 million. 
Considering you investment of $396 million, that is 11% return over a period of 3 days. 
That is very hard to achieve for a sum of money that large. The profits can be different if you play with the numbers because I made a lot of loose assumptions over and underestimating some components.

It's 3-4 months long (Late-April to Late August, exact dates are very flexible). One of the requirements for this internship is that I have to come back to York University to do one more year.

I've been communicating with the MOM(Ministry of Manpower) over the last few days and unfortunately they've been pretty useless at helping me. 

They said that all foreigners working in Singapore need a work permit, which is obvious, they said that the Work Holiday Permit exists to provide students to gain permission to come and live in Singapore and work for some time. They also went on to say that since Canada was not on the approved list of countries I was not eligible and I could not apply for that. 

Then they said that they don't have a specific scheme for Non-Paid interns and that's all they said.

I'm obviously still contacting NUS to see if they can help me find something and I will update the post as I learn more from them.

Now, I was hoping that someone on here would be able to provide any shred of helpful info or anything about their own experiences.

UPDATE: So, NUS got back to me and they're going to help me with everything! I'm going to be getting a Temporary Employment Pass. Now I only have to worry about housing and food."

Lamar Smith has endorsed Romney and has a home in MA, where rumor has it he spends more time than here in Texas. Romney appears to be the front-runner down here, and people who would vote for Romney are probably more likely to vote for Smith than for either Mack or myself. In a runoff, however, there will be much lower turnout, and no one will be voting for the President anymore, making it much more likely that our guys will turnout, not Smith's. Also, our voters are motivated and will turnout twice, while Smith's voters will vote for him largely due to his universal name ID and the fact that they've voted for him for decades. Something else is with two of us, we can cover twice as much ground. Our district is quite large. It includes San Antonio, Austin, and a whole lot of countryside. Mack lives in the countryside, and I'm hoping he can lock up those votes. Meanwhile, I'm in Austin, and I'm focusing here. I haven't seen Mack at a single event, so if he's working as hard as I am, that means we're covering twice as much ground together as either of us would alone. I'm more worried about my supporters getting confused when they see two Richard's than I am about us splitting the anti-Lamar Smith vote.
[2) Are you worried about 2 'Richard M.'s splitting the anti-Lamar Smith vote? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvkt?context=5)| 
[3) How do you respond to these comments about why we shouldn't take you seriously, namely that ""Richard Morgan is NOT a candidate to take seriously. He's someone looking to cash in on splitting the vote. He has similar positions to Lamar while not being Lamar.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvkt?context=5)|2) I don't see it so much as splitting the anti-Smith vote, rather I see it as giving the anti-Smith voters two alternatives. There are people who will prefer Mack, and there are people who will prefer me. By giving people two options, there is a better chance that they will vote for one of us, rather than reluctantly voting for Smith if they disagreed with either of us on important issues to them. Incumbents are more likely to die in office than to lose a Primary. The best way to beat Smith is in a runoff, not in the Primary. To force a runoff, we need to get a combined 50% + 1 vote. If that happens, whichever two candidates received the most votes will go into a runoff.  3) I have some things in common with Smith and some things in common with Mack. Again, it gives voters two choices, and I believe I'm a safer choice. Mack has a following here, but he also has lots of people who will never vote for him. Ever. If things have appeared a little disorganized or rushed, it's because I was the last to enter the race, and both of my opponents have been preparing a lot longer. The first several weeks were hectic, but now that I have a framework and some volunteers in place, things are settling down.  4) [It seems like you filed for your candidacy at the last possible minute.

 |I knew it wouldn't be a popular answer here, but I find it somewhat disappointing that a simple, honest answer regarding my personal beliefs on one issue would cause so many people to write off everything else. This is why politicians pander.
 |I'd also like to point out that I believe all three of us (Smith, Mack, and myself) running in the Primary share the same view on this question. There are many other areas where we disagree.

[What is your opinion of the War on Drugs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46o5ij?context=5)|In my opinion, I think it's bad policy, and I believe history will judge us for it. We should have learned from Prohibition. My opponent has a record of refusing to hear bills he disagrees with, and I disagree with him for that. Rather than block Ron Paul's bill for consideration, he should have let it come up for a much-overdue debate. Let all the facts come out, and then let our Representatives vote. And to those who support the War on Drugs, I think it's important to point out that ending the federal prohibition is not the same as ending all regulation. It's simply returning that authority to the states so that they can each regulate it as they see fit.
[This was a typical political answer. I know you think it's bad policy, and that we should at least debate/discuss the issue, but I want to know how do *you* feel about the war on drugs?   Do you think it has been a complete failure?   Do you think drugs should be legalized, if not at the very least, marijuana?  Is this a criminal issue? Health issue? Moral issue? Individual rights issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46p7dq?context=5)|A) Pretty much. b) I think we should decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. c) It's a matter of rights. It's not the federal government's role.

[*It's not the federal government's role.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46tta8?context=5)|I think there's a big difference between prescription drug safety and the Department of Justice [shutting down an Amish farm for selling fresh milk](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/13/feds-shut-down-amish-farm-selling-fresh-milk/print/).

IMO, it's not enough just to push back on these bills. We need to reverse the trend and write bills (with extensive feedback from the tech community) to limit the government's reach and require them to get a warrant before reading our emails, tracking us through our cell phones, etc. I'll verify in just a minute.
[Also, verification?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nckt?context=5)|Verification added.
[But isn't one of the problems with the bills that they are proposed under the pretense of another goal? You're right that ""congress as a whole"" is doing this, but do you have any specific plans for a paradigm shift regarding these shady strategies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46ogt2?context=5)|Yes, but that's a problem with lots of bills, not just technology-related bills. We need to write smaller bills. We need more debate. We need to write bills that focus on one thing. We need to make sure we use very specific language in the bills rather than leave things vague. We need more transparency. The general public should be able to see the bills with plenty of time to provide feedback, and we need people who will listen.
[Can you please elaborate on a few other issues/views that are fundamentally different than Mr. Smith?  SOPA / PCIP is an important issue, but there are others I would like to hear your views on as well. Anything else that really sets you apart from him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvbi?context=5)|I'm against the NDAA vs he voted for it. I'm against HR 347 vs he voted for it. I'm against the Patriot Act vs he voted for it. I'm against No Child Left behind vs he voted for it.
 |In short, I see Mr. Smith as a big-government Republican, and I see myself as a limited-government conservative. I'm very concerned about all the rights the government has been taking away from us, and I'm against bureaucracy.
[In your opinion, why is congress so adamant in censoring the internet without any regard of the damage they can cause?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nmdd?context=5)|I don't think they really understand the impact these bills would have. Let's look at their backgrounds--you have 181 businessmen, 172 political science majors, 148 lawyers... and 6 engineers. Senator Wyden and Congressman Issa were two of the strongest voices against SOPA, and they both come from science backgrounds.
[Would you accept donations from corporations to lobby for their interests? If not, do you reasonably think you stand any chance to make a difference?

I've already pledged not to keep more than 60% of the salary, so hopefully it's clear already that money is not what motivates me.
 |I did not come from a rich family, and I've worked 80 hours a week since I was 14 between my job and school. 7-8 years ago, I was counting pennies so that I could buy myself a Whopper at the end of each week. At 19, I had a great job. At 23, I bought a great house. At 24, I got promoted to senior front-end developer--the only senior developer under 30. With each success came a temporary satisfaction but a greater feeling of disappointment.
 |I realized a couple years ago that money didn't satisfy me. I'd reached my financial goals and was well on track to my goal of an early retirement and freedom, but I didn't want to spend the next 20 years going through the motions. I spent a few months overseas doing volunteer work, where I witnessed the effects of government corruption and after coming back I began to get involved in politics. That's my passion. I like fighting for the things I believe in. If people want to donate so that I can keep doing what I'm doing, then I think that's great, but money is not going to change what I believe in.
[As someone coming from engineering who is running against a man who is hated for his stance on internet bills, your campaign so far seems to have a laser focus.  How do you compare to Lamar Smith on other issues important to your district that do not relate to internet freedoms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nhwo?context=5)|According to the Austin Chamber of Commerce, 25% of payroll in the Austin are related to tech jobs, so I think it's important to point out that my technology background is more than simply opposing SOPA. It's about fighting to make sure policy doesn't get written that hurts these startups. I was watching C-SPAN the other day when the crowdfunding provision in the JOBS Act was being debated. I noticed that Senator Merkley from Oregon kept talking about the potential for predators to take advantage of investors if crowdfunding sites weren't regulated. Here were some of the thoughts that came to mind that I didn't hear anyone mention: - Crowdfunding platforms have an incentive to prevent fraud, because if their investors get burned, they'll stop using that platform (in favor of a better platform that has more features or less fraud). I truly believe competition works. - If registering with the SEC would actually solve all problems, then wouldn't companies choose to do so voluntarily? - Engineers and tech startups have more or less solved spam. Can't we at least be given a chance to solve this on our own?

Still, good programmers will always have jobs, and the need for good programmers is growing faster than we're producing them. From the reports I've seen, and from my first-hand experience and talking with other programmers, there are no shortage of jobs for good programmers. (If you've seen differently, come to Texas.)
 |As the need for programmers continues to grow, I suspect a shortage of programmers here might motivate employers to move those jobs overseas, and I would support this strategy of bringing skilled workers here so that they could contribute to our economy, rather than sending our jobs to them: [Link to www.ktvb.com](http://www.ktvb.com/news/Congressman-introduces-bill-to-fill-high-tech-jobs-131894928.html)

rlvv6,9,2012-03-30,[Update] Blood Glucose readings ... a project for science going for the next 24 hours.,abraxsis,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/rlvv6/update_blood_glucose_readings_a_project_for/,"From my previous post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/rdj2a/weve_discussed_glucose_levels_but_what_if_they/) you might remember that my blood glucose levels seemed strange to me. After some logging I discovered that on average my levels were staying between 101 and 104, all the time. Even when I was fasted for 8 hours. As such, I began using myself as (yet again) a human guinea pig since it piqued my interest. Below are my fasting glucose readings for the past days (including today)

* Tuesday: 103
* Weds: 105
* Thursday: 104
* This morning (Friday) reading was 111.

Then, I began my experiment. I began by getting a rich carb/sugar source that I liked, in this case apple fritters from Walmart. Literally, one of my all time favorites. Been about 4 months since I had one since they all clock in at about 40g of carbs each. Between 9am and 10am I consumed 4 of these fritters and 1x 20oz Diet Pepsi. This is approximately a carb intact of 160g inside of 60 minutes.

I went on to my internship site, an inpatient psychiatric crisis stabilization unit. I say this because they are a medical facility and often care for diabetic clients. As such, they have three glucose meters to cross check those diabetics with severe problems.

I did no exercise other than driving and walking in the building. I say on a couch in an office during a meeting. I ate nothing after the 4 fritters. After 2.5 hours had elapsed, approx. 12:30pm I proceeded to check my glucose levels on 2 of the 3 available machines plus my personal machine. Two machines gave a reading of 102 mg/dL the third registered 101 mg/dL. After 160g of carbs my levels actually DROPPED from my morning reading. Even the on-site nurse practitioner was like, ""Wtf? Youve not had carbs in weeks so it should be spiking, just a little bit at least.""

I allowed an additional hour to pass and tested again. Again, 2 of the machines read 103mg/dL and the 3rd read out 102 mg/dL.

For my science brain this just wasn't making any sense. So I trudged further and declared that today would be an official cheat day ... for science.

I ate pizza for lunch around 2pm, 1x oatmeal cream pie @ 3pm. left work at 5pm. Travelled home, ate 2x oatmeal cream pies, a bowl of reduced fat (the horror!) butter pecan ice cream, and finished the evening off with a few muncho potato chips at 7pm. I chose 7 pm so I could begin a full 12 hour fast versus the ~8hr fasts I have been doing the past week. At 9pm a glucose check on my single, at home, meter read 128 mg/dL.

At 10pm (approx. 10 minutes ago) they read 150 mg/dL. (For anyone interested my blood pressure is also elevated at this point at 138/78 mmHg and my pulse is 76, both up from my usual 120/60 and ~55bpm)

**11:30pm Update** Blood Sugar is now 117 mg/dL, blood pressure is 131/71 and my pulse is down to 68.

I am now **5** hours into my fast, I did use a small drink of non-caloric beverage to swallow some meds at 9pm and I'll likely have some cold water just before bed

**8:05am Update** Glucose reading have dropped back to 106 mg/dL. Blood pressure and pulse have returned to normal. Next step, is to the gym.

At that time, I'll resume a strict keto diet checking my levels every 2-3 hours. I'll post all of those here.

Just some random science points for those curious ... when checking on 3 meters all the blood came from a single finger with the actual lancet pricks being evenly spaced from one another in a triangular pattern. Blood was expressed and placed within each meter within 5 seconds of its exposure to air.

I realize this isn't a completely scientific test, but I think in addition to giving me a good idea of what carbs do to my system after being severely limited for so long, this little experiment let someone see how levels can change in response to what we consider significant amounts of carbohydrates. Sadly, what I have eaten today, which likely tops 500g of carbs, is what many Americans eat every single day. The stress this places on the pancreas and even the cardiovascular system is insane!

**After doing some researching I found several references to higher than normal fasting glucose levels in low carb dieters. In particular ...**
&gt;**One caveat here is that very low-carb diets will produce elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Why? Because low-carb diets induce insulin resistance. Restricting carbohydrates produces a natural drop in insulin levels, which in turn activates hormone sensitive lipase. Fat tissue is then broken down, and non-esterified fatty acids (a.k.a. “free fatty acids” or NEFA) are released into the bloodstream. These NEFA are taken up by the muscles, which use them as fuel. And since the muscle’s needs for fuel has been met, it decreases sensitivity to insulin. So, if you eat a low-carb diet and have borderline high FBG (i.e. 90-105), it may not be cause for concern. Your post-meal blood sugars and A1c levels are more important.**

* **Just a final note, Ill be editing the lower half of this post as I complete each section of the experiment. So be sure to check back tomorrow evening.**

The second wave of infection began around 5 AM, EST.  The aforementioned alarm clocks performed a double duty this morning;  they woke people up and gave them a psyche-destroying dose of the alien transmission, all at once.  That is, of course, if they had survived the night to wake up at all.  The death toll of the previous few hours was staggering, and a fair number of the deceased had died, more or less, in their sleep - victims of a plethora of insanity-related disasters.

This second wave continued, unabated, for roughly an hour and a half.  After that, radio satellites began to shut down.  Someone had finally figured out the cause of the insanity plague, and the information networked out from government to government.  However, political fumbling and suspicion were slowing the process down, and in the meantime the Earth kept spinning on its axis, continuously exposing more of its surface to the transmission's bombardment.  Yachts and cruise ships were becoming  floating slaughterhouses.  Off-shore oil rigs were igniting into towers of explosive flame.  The coast guard and other seafaring rescue services were attempting to rescue madmen, with disastrous results.

For over a billion people, a new day was dawning on a nightmarish new world.

Rico, his girlfriend, the stewardesses and a few other passengers of Delta flight 309 huddled with the captain in the locked cockpit.  The co-pilot was dead, lost to the frenzy while trying to help the survivors into the cockpit.  Some of  those seeking shelter had to be left outside.  There wasn't enough room, they couldn't cram in fast enough and had been set upon by the fiends.  Rico had slammed the door shut on their screams.  He had to, in order to save those who had gotten into the cockpit first.  There had been no other choice, other than to die with them.

Most of those huddled in the cockpit had been asleep when the assault had commenced.  The savage violence had been perpetrated by those passengers that had been listening to any radio station on their airline-provided headphones.

The remaining passengers outside the cockpit were either dead, tearing the cabins apart, murdering each other or trying to break the door of the cockpit in, enthusiastically and tirelessly.  The noise created by the constant assault on the door was almost unbearable.  

Some of the other survivors huddled in the room were hurt very badly.  Rico was missing most of his right ear, lost to a child's bite, and his girlfriend had taken a terrible pummeling by a small group of the infected passengers.  She was in a bad way, barely conscious.  Her face was swollen and caked with blood.  

None of them knew what the hell was happening, exactly.  The pilot couldn't get an answer from control at Eppley Airfield, their destination, and as it came into view the reason why became obvious - it was on fire.  From their vantage point far above, the ragged survivors could see multiple mushroom clouds bellowing up into the air, as burning tanks of jet fuel erupted with explosive fury.   Omaha itself was fucked.  The power grid had been knocked out, and the entire city was writhing in blazing agony.   Dozens of smaller, flickering points of light dotted the dark landscape below them, as far as they could see - the entire state seemed to be igniting.  

They were now making their way to Lincoln.  They had enough fuel to get there, but that was it.  And Lincoln was not answering

""It's the apocalypse,"" Rico said quietly.  

""Shut up, don't say that!"" another man barked at him.  Rico regarded him calmly.

""Take a look down there, man.  It's all over for us.""  The other man looked away, and abruptly began to heave with great, shuddering sobs.  Rico stared back down at the hell below.  His girlfriend's hand was cold in his.  She was dead.

""It's the end,"" he repeated, and began to cry himself.

At ten after six, Michelle's radio blared to life.  It was the Johnny D and Tugger show, her favorite way to wake up.  They were so *crazy* and *funny*, those guys.  She had a crush on their voices.

*""GOOOOD MORNING PEOPLLLLLE!!""* Johnny D cackled, and Michelle sat bolt upright in the bed.  The fuck?  His voice was hoarse and cracked, barely recognizable.  In the background, a woman was shrieking, but the sound was strangled.  There was mad laughter, as well.

""We're just about set to see if the little slut intern we got here can take what the Tugster has to give her.  FUUUUCK *YEAH!*  What's going on back there, Tugger?""

""I'm choking this bitch real good, softening her up.""  Tugger called out. His voice was a bit fainter, from being farther away from the mic.  It was a shrill witch's caw.  There was more horrid laughter at this, like a crowd of men was in the booth with them.

""Okay, then, Tugger-ooni, pin that piglet down and let 'er *rip!*""

The screams became more frantic, then markedly gurgled.  The men cheered.  Michelle lunged for the alarm clock and snapped it off so hard that she broke the volume dial.  

Outside, she could hear sirens.  A lot of sirens.

The family dog backed itself into a corner, growling deep in his chest.  He was a Shepard mix, a big boy, and his hackles were raised.  He was bleeding badly from the top of his furry skull.  The dog's owners, his family, his loved ones - they advanced upon him with knives, baseball bats and fireplace pokers.  The dog faced them off, hurt, bewildered, afraid.  His family rushed in on him, and the dog sprang at them with all of his desperate fury.

In the oval office, the President sat with his closest advisors.  The discussion centered around the possibility of China's involvement in this disaster.  The President's hair was an uncombed mess, his eyes lined and shocked.  

The leading consensus was that, if Jintao was involved, he would pay for it with the nuclear incineration of his country, and all of its inhabitants.

The Marines were forced to abandon their Jeep and go on foot after encountering a devastating multi-vehicle pile-up on the freeway.  Both of them were veterans of the Middle East, and were not strangers to the hellish strife of a war zone, but this ... this was on native soil.  It made their minds reel to see the destruction wrought by the infected.

They stuck to traveling in cover on the side of the road, staying as much as possible either in the thin scrub of woods on the side of the freeway or the weedy ditch.  They were rapidly losing the cover of darkness, and the marauding groups and individuals were becoming difficult to hide from.  Twice they had to run for their lives, their ammo being long since spent, and at one point the two had a hair-raising, hand-to-hand fight with three men and a teen girl.  They had attacked like ravenous animals, clawing and biting and lashing out wildly.  The Marines dispatched them with brutal and efficient kicks and stabs from their KA-BARs,  managing to sustain little injury to themselves save some superficial cuts and scrapes.  

The two men did not know each other previously.  They only knew each others last names, from their ID tags.  Buono and Kosh.  They spoke very little to each other.  In the face of their current situation, there wasn't much to say, really.

""I'm not going back to the base,"" Kosh suddenly stated flatly.  Buono nodded.

""Me, neither,"" he agreed.  In the face of what they had seen so far, both men only wanted to find their loved ones back home.  The Corps could take care of itself.

A soft, persistent knocking at the door brought Hank to consciousness.  His head pounded from the whiskey.  He looked blearily at his clock ... six twenty-three in the fucking *morning*.  

""The fuck is it!?""  he hollered at the door.  The knocking stopped.  Then the kicking started.  BANG BANG BANG, each blow against the door producing a concussive ache in his skull.  Enraged, Hank jumped up from his cot and thundered his two hundred sixty pounds across the bachelor apartment to the door.  He flung it open, a mass of muscle and scars clad in boxer shorts, and opened his mouth to start yelling.

In front of him was a little girl, the neighbor slut's kid, probably six or so.  She had a completely fucked-up look on her face.  She looked like a grinning gremlin, a delicate figurine made of malice and dressed in footy pajamas.

""Uh ..."" Hank trailed off, anger forgotten, uneasy now.  ""What are you doing, kid?  What is it?""

""I come over to give you something!"" she yelled up at him, brightly.  She giggled.  It was creepy.

""What?""

*""THIS!""* she screamed, and she stuck a paring knife into Hank's leg, just above the knee.  A lance of cold, sickening agony shot up his quadricep and he toppled  backward with a shocked grunt.  The little girl was on him in a flash, slashing at his face and neck.  Hank bellowed in pain and struck out with his fist.  He connected solidly, right between her eyes, and she was flung back into the hallway like a ragdoll.  She lay still on the faded red carpet.

""What the fucking *fuck*."" Hank spat out.  He was bleeding from a number of deep cuts on his face and neck.    Shit, the kid!  Did he kill her?  Fuuuuuuck .... Hank stumbled out into the hall, knelt beside the girl, his blood pattering down on and around her, making red blossoms on the light blue flannel of the girl's jammies.

""Kid ... ah shit, kid, hey, you all right?""  He rolled her onto her back, intending to check her pulse.  There was a huge knot and bruise developing on her forehead.  Oh, jesus, this is bad, he thought.  He lowered his head to listen for her heart, and suddenly the girl snapped up like a snake and sank her teeth into his cheek.  He screamed and shot to his feet, the kid actually hanging from his face like a cartoon attack dog.  She was growling and chewing, kicking, and Hank slammed her against the wall once, twice, a third time with immense force.  There was a brittle breaking sound from within the child's body, and her mouth relaxed it's grip.  She fell limply to the floor, indisputably dead now.  Hank did a semi-comical pain and horror dance, there in the hallway in his underwear, then ran back into his apartment and locked the door.  His mind was spinning, heart pounding, bleeding and hurting from a dozen wounds.  

*Cops*, he thought.  *Ambulance*.

The phone was dead.  And outside the window, in the street ... Hell had taken over.

No internships (looking for this summer, any advice on that would be awesome as well), have worked as a tutor on campus and off campus for the past year and will continue till graduation. 

So just wondering how I would look to potential employers??

rlq6g,124,2012-03-30,The worst part is that nobody will ever believe you.,23523,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rlq6g/the_worst_part_is_that_nobody_will_ever_believe/,"Thank you everybody. After [I poured out my soul yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rjilx/just_going_home_after_work/) and saw all your responses and realised that maybe people understand I felt much better. I hope it will be the same today, because things did not exactly turn out for the better. I wrote a few replies during my work day. So you might have read those already and you guys gave me a few things to think about. Things didn't go upwards from there but somehow I am more composed today. For the last maybe two or three hours the hair on my back is standing up straight, I am tense as seldom before, and I am scared to a level I can't even describe. But I know now that I'm not insane, I know that something is happening and maybe its the adrenaline that's pumping through my blood, but my head, now, it seems clear. All day I couldn't concentrate on my work at all, I just thought about the last evening and the events, and my mind kept going back to that moment that seems to have shaken my whole belief system in its foundations. I don't believe in anything supernatural but I definitely know now that I'm not crazy. Although everybody else thinks that now.

It all got worse when my boss came into the office. He was supposed to be out all day on some sort of conference but he cut it short because he said too many people called in sick. I'm actually fairly close to him. I know him from a few years before I started here, he is the one who got me the job. That somehow allows me to talk with him on a level of equals and to ask questions and say things that others here wouldn't dare. I guess for people not close to him he is a bit intimidating because of his big frame and the way he doesn't blink much. But there is something else about our long connection that is worth mentioning here: He also is willing to share things with me. He lets his guard down while usually he maintains his authority. 

When he called me into his office I thought he had noticed how poorly I worked today, maybe even that I checked on reddit every hour or so, hoping for somebody to give me a clue what might have happened or for somebody to tell me they experienced similar things. When he called me in I thought he would send me home or tell me to get my act together. I didn't expect him to say ""I need to ask you something"". And even less did I expect him to say ""I think something weird is going on"". He told me how in the last weeks people had been calling in sick at a higher rate than usually. To call in sick, you must know, the policy here is to call your supervisor directly. Since he is responsible for quite a few of us and is close to some other managers he is fairly well informed about what's going on and shares a lot with the other managers. But, he said, this is something I need to keep silent about, that he didn't want to talk about this with anyone else. It's just because he values my opinion and knows how rational I usually am, that's why he wanted to talk to me. I guess he too wanted to make sure that he wasn't going crazy.

""You know"", he said, ""you know how Esteban called in sick last month?"" I nodded, so he continued: ""that's when I noticed it first"". I asked him what he meant and instead of answering he just said ""please, don't think I'm crazy. I don't need you to believe me, I'm just trying to understand if it's me or if it's something else. Maybe I'm thinking too much into this"". I let out a half-hearted laugh and said of course I knew he wasn't crazy. If anything I must be the more crazy one of us, I thought. By this point, you know, i already had seen [horrorfangirls reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rjilx/just_going_home_after_work/c46lcc8) to my post from yesterday. I was certain the handle was on open and that the security guard had commented on it. So I knew that either I must be completely insane and hallucinating the whole thing - but then, why am I not waking out of this - or, there must be.. something.

My boss, Paul, sighed and spoke on. ""It's when Esteban called in sick. That's when I noticed. You know how he is, even when there would be a sword in his chest he would still be making jokes. This guy can't be serious, he always is cheerful and happy and joking."" I nodded and felt how I tensed. Paul got visibly more nervous. ""It was when he called.. I'm not sure how to say it. It was his voice. It was monotonous. And he didn't make any jokes. I mean, I don't expect people to be happy or to make jokes when they call in sick, but he was just.. off. His voice didn't sound strange, it was definitely him, but he was so damn monotonous. I know company policy doesn't allow me to speak about health issues, that's a private thing. But I just need to say it, you know, he didn't really give a reason. He just said 'Hello Paul. It's me, Esteban. I will be sick for a while.' I asked him why and without even a moment hesitation - there was no 'uuh' or even a small pause - he just said 'I will be sick for a while'. That's all he said. I asked again and he repeated the same sentence again when I asked a second time, you know, it's not that he needed to tell me, but I thought he trusts me and would have told me what it was"".

I wanted to reply that that was indeed strange and that it was odd and that I wouldn't have expected that but I didn't have time. Paul got impatient, he talked quicker, visibly more shaken: ""And you know, the same with Grace. I wouldn't really expect her to be emotional or tell me her issues, you know how withdrawn she is. But she called in only two or three days later, only two damn days later, and I had nearly forgotten about the thing with Esteban, I had sorted out his replacement and I had nearly forgotten, but then Grace called and all she said was 'Hello Paul, It's me, Grace. I will be sick for a while'. I nearly fell off my chair. The *exact* same words. And, worse, the same voice. Of course, no, it was her voice, not the same voice. But it was the same style of speaking, it was as if she was completely without emotion. I didn't even have time to ask anything, she just said it again, 'I will be sick for a while'. And then she did hang up."" Where Paul had nearly fallen off his chair, I had just turned to stone. I could just feel how every single cell in my body had frozen, how the only thing rushing through my body were hormones of fear. You know, the fight or flight instinct. It's not that Paul did anything. And I didn't see anything. But I felt terror so deep inside me it was in my bones. And Paul had not even finished.

""And since then, as you know, they both didn't come back to work. I tried calling both of them a few times, but neither answered the landline or their mobiles or even their emails, hell I even tried facebook."" I was gasping at this point, I remember Pauls words as clear as anything can be, but what I said I don't remember. It must have been something soothing, something where I tried to excuse what happened, play it down, as I usually would, but it must not have come out right. Paul just snapped ""Oh come on, I'm not a child. I don't need you to tell me it will all clear itself out. Actually, I don't want you to, because I know its a lie. I know, because three other people called in sick. The two guys from the far end table, you know, the ones who always stick with themselves. They called in sick last week Thursday, around 10pm. They left me messages on my voicemail. Identical messages. Messages identical not just to each other, but to the freaking two I told you above."" I think at this point my heart skipped a beat. And Paul who I had known for several years as maybe the most rational, the most calm person I knew, went on, and I could hear a slight panic in his voice: ""But today. Today was the kicker. Have you seen Martha today?"" I thought for a moment, my mind moving as slow as seldom before, as if my brain was working at a quarter of its normal speed. I thought of Martha, the pretty polish girl who sat in the office opposite of mine. Sometimes she distracted my from my work, not by saying anything, but just by being there. How could I ever not realise she was missing. But today, I tried to think back, did she say her usual smiling ""good morning""? No, I don't think so. She didn't ask my office whether we'd join them for lunch either. I must have been so upset, so sleep deprived and exhausted and mentally restless from last night that I didn't even notice she was missing. I realised how out of my usual self I must have been. ""No"" I said. ""No, I certainly didn't"". ""I would have been surprised"", Paul said, ""because she called me. It's maybe twenty minutes ago."" He was silent and I knew his answer already but I still asked, I don't know why I asked, maybe it would have been better not to hear it. ""She said 'Hi Paul, it's Martha. I will be sick for a while'"". He added with a weak voice ""that's all she said"". As if I didn't know that already.

We both just sat there, quietly. I have no idea how long we sat there, literally staring at each other, both looking in the other's eye. We were both trying to find any hint that the other had an answer. There was no need to ask the question, it was obvious. It was impossible and yet it was obvious. And Paul didn't even know my story yet.

After what seemed like ages I somehow got out of this mode, I shaked my head slightly and just opened my mouth to say ""I have to tell you something too"", when he jumped up, abruptly, he must have hit his legs against his wooden desk, I heard the sound, but he didn't even seem to notice. ""Let's go"", he said. ""Let's get out of here"", and before I could get out of my frozen state he had already pulled me up and out of his office and he shouted along the corridor with half-open offices ""guys, everybody, we make it a short Friday, let's get home"". There was some quiet cheering but people mostly seemed confused. It's not as if we didn't take short Fridays, occasionally, just usually he would send us a note at least the day before. I think it's because he didn't want to be alone either, but we both just stood there, smiling awkwardly, probably drenched in sweat and smelling of this slightly sweet and bitter odour you can only smell when a person fears for their life. Pretty much everyone was ready to leave within less than two minutes, like people in most offices on most Fridays they had just just been sitting and wasting time while  waiting for the clock to jump to the right number. Just two or three were slower, the group of us, maybe 9 in total, including Paul and me, we started walking and I could hear the others rushing to catch up with us after a few moments.

Somebody, I think it was Thomas, asked whether Paul already told the rest of the team, on the other floor. Paul just wiped it away with a ""yeah, sure"". I don't think he was even listening. Finally being able, to get the courage and strength to tell his story to someone must have made him feel it and see it in a different light, must have made him see it in the extreme, in the clarity and in the whole awkward and scary whole of it - just like I experienced it yesterday. Telling your story is cathartic, I always knew that, but I never realised until then that telling a story also makes you feel the story, makes you experience the things, in your mind, as if they just happened. It was less than a second after Paul had answered, that this feeling hit me, came back to me, this feeling or.. this moment, this moment of Cecile being pulled off my shoulder. It's when I noticed in which direction we walked.

I froze on the spot. I froze, and I must have turned even more pale and even more cold than i had been all day. It didn't take long for someone to notice, it was the new intern, he had just started two weeks ago, and he was one of those two or three who were a bit slower. I guess he must have been searching something in his bag or so, because he walked straight into me, just hit his head at the back of my left shoulder. I don't remember if I really felt it, but I woke up from my daze in that moment and of course everyone turned around when they heard the distinct bone-on-bone sound of him walking into me. They stared at me while I opened and closed my jaw helplessly a few times, without any sound coming out, it was like my tongue was doing something independent from my lips and jaw and lungs. Paul said, sternly and rudely ""I said let's get out of here"". I guess the rudeness took everyone by surprise since they didn't know *why* we left early. They must have assumed it was because he was in a really good mood or maybe a birthday or maybe he was a bit sick and just wanted to get home early himself. I could see the surprise glances flying between the others, the intern behind me squeezed out a muffled ""sorry, sorry Mark"". I don't know what Paul and I looked like, I just stared at his face, and he at mine, both of us pale and even to the others the dread in our eyes must have been obvious. ""No.. no.. not the elevators."" I pressed out. ""P.. please"".

Paul was having none of it. ""I said we get out"". He spoke but to me it sounded like he was screaming, shouting, like he *wanted* to shout. He grabbed my arm and forcefully dragged me along, my voice failed me again, I tried to speak, say something, but there was nothing I could do, the rest, obviously stunned, fell behind for a few moments, for a few moments, exactly until Paul barked ""Go"". One word was enough, the situation was so tense - and none of them could have known why - the situation was so tense, just from these few moments, these raw emotions that obviously must have shaken two adult men into the most unusual behaviour they - we - had ever shown. I tried to pull back, but my feet kept walking while Paul kept pulling my arm, he must have been hurting me but I didn't feel it, all I could think of was that there is one single place I did not want to be, one single place that I knew was now the wrong place to be.

It didn't take long, I guess, I can't really find the following moments from my memory. What I remember though is the moment the finger touched the button. I'm not sure who's finger it was, I didn't look a the finger, it's the button I stared at because I knew what it meant. Just a moment later an elevator opened - on the left side, in the middle. It had been standing there. ""At least it's not *that* one"" I thought, or I guess I must have thought it, because somehow now I was pulling forward. I knew there was no way out of this, no way out of this except to tell everyone the whole story, and I knew, I just knew, after our odd behaviour that everyone would just think I was insane in that very moment. Paul and I got in first. Someone, probably Thomas as well, suggested that the rest of them would wait there for the next elevator - we really must have scared them. But Paul ordered them in, and, in a weird mix of hesitation and hurry, they all came in. The elevator nearly closed the last two out but something got in front of the sensor - maybe someone stretched out their hand? - and the door opened again and they came in.

The new intern - I really should know his name by now - pressed the button for the ground floor and probably was surprised when Paul just pushed it as well, as if he didn't notice the intern's finger. Me just standing next to him, right at the wall, far away from the center of the elevator, far away from the emergency exit. Especially the intern must have been surprised when Paul kept pushing the button again and again and again and again, quickly, one time after the other, faster and faster, as if pushing it more would somehow make the elevator speed up.

We moved downwards, with the typical clonking sound you hear when the elevator starts its journey, and I could feel the tension in the small cabin, I could feel how our bodies were churning out stress hormones at an unhealthy rate, how our hearts were all beating twice as fast as normal. How everybody, even as they didn't know anything that Paul knew, much less even, what I knew, just had one thought, one goal: To get out. You know this moment of fear, when you don't want to think, do, say anything - you just want to run? That is, and I'm not doubting that for a second, that is what every one of us felt. That's what every one of us felt - when it happened.

Exactly the same loud, screeching sound of metal scraping metal. The sudden, hard stop. All lights went out.

That's when I broke. I'm not sure if I heard the small metallic sound that I had heard the day before, the sound that had burned itself in my brain like none ever before, the sound that I associated with whatever it was that had taken Cecile. I'm not sure if I heard that sound, among all the other noise, but I guess I must have. Or maybe I just reacted to the situation, to the night with barely any sleep, to the day that I was ruminating and worrying, to the accumulated tension that had kept me awake until then against my exhaustion and fear.

That moment my brain turned itself off, I became something else, something purely emotional, something primal. My lungs - not me, my lungs - let out a roar, a scream, a sound that was a mix of anger and hate and even more anger while my fist, already cold from terror, clenched hard. I was screaming as never before while my arm hammered my hand hard against the glass mirror on the wall, I could feel how I was pushing against the metal frame of the elevator behind it, how glass pieces were cutting through my skin and flying all over the room. There was no light but I felt as if I could see, I simply knew where everyone was, I could feel, I could *see* the expressions of fear on my colleagues' faces, I could see how Paul jumped back, probably right onto the intern, but, mainly, most importantly, away from me. I was jumping up and screaming at the top of my lungs ""LEAVE ME ALONE. LEAVE ME ALONG, HAVEN'T I SUFFERED ENOUGH?!!?"" My fists must have kept hammering against the mirrors and walls, I must have kept screaming, but all I can remember from then on is how I felt, how my insides were boiling with a mix of terror and rage, how every muscle, every fibre, every cell of my body awoke in just one moment, how I jumped up so strongly that my elbow hit the ceiling and how I came back down with a loud, crunching sound that shaked the whole elevator. It fell. It moved. The elevator moved, fell, I should say, because from the hazy blurr that I remember I remember feeling this special feeling, you know when you are on an airplane, and suddenly the floor seems to fall down, away from your feet, and then it takes just a fraction of a second for you to follow, but you feel it, I felt it. That didn't stop me, of course, I kept screaming, I can't remember breathing in at all, all I did was I threw all the air that was inside me, together with all the tension and anger from a day of pure terror, I was pressing all this out, trying to throw it at whatever it was, at whatever this thing was that had terrorised me, that had taken Cecile, that must have taken the others. I was never before so alive and at the same time so not in myself, I wasn't me, just this primal being full of anger and terror. I didn't notice the lights turning on, I don't remember seeing and I don't remember not seeing either. I just knew where everything was in that dreadful room, I knew where it all was, even when I saw that now it was not just the reflection of my face that was full of terror, but also the faces of my coworkers, all of us covered in shards and cuts and with skin that looked as if someone had drained the colour out of the world. The difference being that I was scared of *that*, but they were scared of *me*.

Maybe I screamed until we arrived downstairs, the ground floor, safety, until the doors started to open and until my bloody and snow-white hands pushed between the opening door. I basically ripped it open, just with that one goal of getting out, just with that one goal of getting *away*, of running, of running as far as I could, of running until my breath would fail me.

Someone was following me and I knew it was Paul, it was not just that I knew he was a great runner, and that I could, when the fog from my mind slowly cleared, hear the regularity of his steps that only a trained runner has. I knew it was Paul because I knew that he would have been the only one able to move, the only one who knew enough, who could understand enough, to be able to run after me when I sped out of that elevator, when I jumped the security gate and pushed the guard aside and ran against the exit door so hard that it flew to the side against the frame of bulletproof glass.

I knew it was Paul, and when I realised that I finally noticed my body again. It hit me heavy how tired, no, exhausted to the maximum, my body was. I started to feel the first cold air of the evening flying past me. I started to feel the pain of my feet, then my hands, stinging with pain. My muscles, they must have been cramping for a while. I have no idea about how long, but I ran at least two miles, in a straight line, I must have crossed busy streets and walked past pedestrians but I have no recollection of that at all. I just slowed down, like a runner ending his race behind the finish line. I tried slowing down to a walk, when I felt my knees giving in, when I fell backwards, on my hurting hand that stung again in pain, but at least it kept me sitting until Paul moved my back against a car.

I might have blacked out for a moment, or maybe I just don't remember. You know, our brains can't really process too many things at once, and when there is too much coming in your brain just shuts down for a moment, resetting itself to be able to function. I remember being next to Paul, both of us breathing hard, my chest hurting, if from the screaming or the running or something else, I have no idea. But I felt the catharsis. The terror had left me, I would have laughed if I had had the energy for it. We sat for a while, people walked by but I didn't even look up to see who they were or how they would react to us, two well-dressed men, sitting there full of shards and blood and pale as snow and breathing with deep gasps. I could feel Pauls head falling on my shoulder and I knew he didn't care either. 

It took us a while to get back up. Paul supported me, my right foot felt - feels - like something is cutting deep inside my flesh, like some broken bone. But we didn't care about a doctor or a hospital. We just needed to get somewhere with a Whiskey and silence and privacy. We didn't even talk about that, I guess we just both knew the other wanted the same. We got a taxi, Paul did it, I couldn't even think straight, I could only feel, could only try and process all this emotion that was now, slowly, fading away. I could feel my body calming down, very slowly, my heart pumping hard to refill the energy reserves of my muscles and cells.

I told him, tonight, I told Paul everything. I told him what happened, with the elevator, with Cecile, with writing on here and how you made me realise I wasn't crazy. We cried while we sat in his apartment, talking, getting it all out, emptying our hearts with all the fear and terror we had felt. I realise that he probably had been worse off then me. It was the unknown that scared me so much, the not understanding - and he had it seen building up for weeks. He said I should write it off my soul, to go back to here and share my story - and he would do the same with his diary. Writing helps, he said, it gets your thoughts in order. It helps to process the things that happened, it helps to put your memories in order. Paul got a call from two or three of our colleagues, I don't think he answered. What would he tell them? That I am insane, he would have to say. That a harmless broken elevator was what triggered some sort of insanity from all those hours of overtime I've been doing, a mental breakdown, a burnout from work and party and worry and lack of sleep.

And, I guess, that's what we will say. I would like to tell them my story. I like my colleagues, they are good people. And I would like to warn them, in case this.. whatever it is.. is still there. We escaped from something, but I don't know how or why. I would like to tell my colleagues what happened, tell them, warn them, and I really want them to understand me, I don't want them to be scared of me or worried about me.

But I know I have only two options: either I will plead insanity, temporary insanity - that I had a breakdown from all the stress, and when the elevator stopped it just triggered it. IfI say that they might have pity and they might forget that I covered them in shards and someday they might be able to sit in the same room with me again. Or I could tell them what I told you. I could tell them what happened. And then they would certainly never again believe even for a moment that I could be sane. They would laugh, awkwardly and dismiss what happened today as nothing, or, more exactly, as just me being crazy. They would live their lives as if nothing happened, just with one person less in it.. and I fear then something will happen to them. I will tell them it was just a breakdown, because if someone is only insane for a moment, then you will always have a small grain of doubt. You will always think that maybe, after all, this person that was always normal and is now normal again, you will think that maybe in that moment he wasn't insane, that maybe there is something true about it. At least then I can hope that they will be careful. 

I know yesterday many of you pushed me to do this. I will try to find some sort of authorities that I can talk to, that I can forward this text with a few more details about the place and people involved, so that they can send someone who knows how to deal with.. strange things. There is something, I know it with certainty. But I know I can only tell them anonymously, because, simply, I know no one will believe me and I don't want to end up in an asylum. Now, while reflecting on it, I realise this may be the hardest part. For the next weeks, months, years, maybe my whole life I will have to pretend nothing happened. I will meet thousands of people, maybe someday I will marry and raise kids. And I realise now that the scariest, hardest, most impossible part, the worst part about experiencing something unbelievable, about what I experienced the last two days - the worst part is that nobody will ever believe you."
