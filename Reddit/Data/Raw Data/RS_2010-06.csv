I came into town on Saturday and tried to find something quick on Craigslist, but wasn't able to find anything decent and close. Work starts tomorrow, and I just checked into a weekly-stay hotel while I find a place for the summer.

I've never lived in Houston before. I'm originally from Iowa and came down to Texas to go to school at A&amp;M, so I'm not that familiar with the Houston area. D There's stuff of decent quality on Craigslist, but the commutes often become horrendous. Does anyone have any suggestions a good place to look for a room to rent?"

The dealer's tire place discovered that after two fruitless attempts at simply doing some wheel balancing. 

Because of the bend, we had to go to the dealer to order a new wheel. On the way over, the ABS warning light started going off. Once we arrived, one of the lot employees managed to knock the driver's side window off its track (maybe more-- it's getting looked at now) while he was playing with it. 

The dealership has been less than cooperative with us, and we've discovered that they have an F rating from the BBB because of complaints related to repairs and warranty satisfaction.

Advice on Life?,UK-AL,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cafny/tired_of_life_thinking_of_becoming_a_entrepreneur/,"No this isn't suicide post, however it's about something that feels quite bad, my life at the moment is boring and pretty much lonely as hell. This is coming from someone who does not like to admit there weaknesses. I've decided enough is enough.

Pretty much my whole life, i've lacked any sort charisma. I'm polite and nice but people merely tolerate me, rather than attracted to me. In my youth I was a quiet type, I used to be scared of offending people, and what people thought of me. People liked me, but never enough to invite me or admire me etc.

In my later teenage years, I become more outspoken and witty, although probably because of the need to defend myself, however I think I did come across as arrogant and slightly smugish sometimes. However I try to make a active effort to nice to people, but sometimes I let myself down when I'm angry. Again people liked me, but never enough to invite me etc. We talk, we chat, have lunch together with my friends at work but that's it, i try to actively set up going out with my friends, but that usually falls flat on it's face. Some of my friends moved down to london, study fashion at central saint martins and generally living it up, they have beautiful partners etc. This only makes me feel much much worse, when I compare my life to theres.

So basically I go out on weekends, once every two months, probably less. A very very boring life, it feels like i'm wasting it and i'm defiantly not enjoying my life. I wish i could travel more, and see the world.

My love life(I'm gay) is drastic, I have many short relationships. I would love to be able come back to same person everyday and feel content. I feel as though this is probably because of my personality. I have good looks or so i'm told, but the relationships it attracts only last a few weeks. I've basically given up on that. I'd rather have a cup tea, then even think about sex at the moment. It's been about 6 months, since i've stopped trying.

So most of my spare time is spent on my computer with life going by, and not by choice. However this probably given rise to my talent in life, which pretty much everything to do with computers. I enjoyed programming from a young age, I've designed compilers, lexers, parsers, simple 3d engines, studied computer science theory, just to simply to keep me entertained in my spare time. I also took a very keen interest in graphic design and I'm quite good at it since i started from a young age. Over the years I've acquired book skills in lots of areas in computer science, graphics and business. I'm a generalist.

Using this skills I pretty much knew I could excel at my career, make an impact on the world and give some meaning to life.

At uni i studied computer science, and that's going well. However this is a course where I have to take a industrial placement, out of haste I took one in a Web Development company. 

The boss was after to iPhone developer, so seeing this as a opportunity to excel I volunteered, the boss promising I could manage the project, deal with clients, part time consulting once i'm back at uni etc. The company did not implement source control, so that was my first point of call. The First few projects went well development wise, however they did not sell well because he was asking for products in an already saturated market i.e Twitter clients etc

Then one day we took on a new hire, a graduate. He had charisma, friendly and likeable, his technical side was not that great, pretty much admitting to me he got through Uni by asking for help of his Uni friends and memorising answers. He knew one language well, php, could develop basic web sites etc. However he also wanted to do iPhone development, the boss asked me to help him which I was more than happy to, he had will to learn which I respected.

I mentored him teaching him c, memory management, reference counting, Object Orientation(Which I was surprised he did not know!), Objective-C and the iphone api's. I made exercises designed to make the concepts click in his head which all worked well at the time. I wanted to make him a developer I could rely on, and open his mind to real computer science. I spent great effort in training him. He was grateful at the time.

We did a project together, went well. Then it started going down hill, projects came in thick and fast, deadlines becoming stupid such as 1 Week per 1 app, which is probably a struggle by the boss to make it profitable. Code quality went down, especially my partners code code quality, he pretty much turned into a cowboy developer, generating spaghetti code with no structure, no refactoring no comments etc. He took no time looking at the code at a higher level, if a design did not work, he would just hack it till did. Once he has invested so much time into code, he would refuse to change it.

Trying to get a grip on the quality I tried to implement Code Style guides, OO principles , mandating comments etc. He refused to implement any of it and tried ask the boss for help which he essentially said ""he does not have to listen to you"", remember I'm an intern. This carried on, project management slowly turned over to him, he now talks to clients. So basically the person i trained up is now ahead of me. I'm pumping out buggy crap which no one will buy, with no leadership at my hands to change that. This has had massive decremental effect on me, I'm unmotivated, I don't want to go to work, I'm late for work. I hate it. Boss moans at me coming in late, but i honestly don't care. This is not what i want to make, or do. I want to make my dent in the world, not make shovel ware for company that does not have any sense of direction desperately trying to turn profitable. The only reason it survives, is that the owner is wealthy and can keep pumping money in. 

So basically that's story of my life, constantly getting screwed over, hardly any social life and a crap job. Probably my fault for investing myself in the company as a intern in the first place.

So now i'm thinking of launching my own company, with my own vision using my own skills to directly benefit me. I want to make software people want to use and buy, not crap. I want to make software that has real impact on peoples life's, and is a joy to use and put's smiles on peoples faces. Something to devote my life to for a few years, to give my life meaning. I don't want to just survive by employment, I want to succeed in life and take control. I have several idea's, which i'm working on after work. Fortunately I have some money thanks to semi-wealthy family(I have some luck), so i can eat and live while i'm at it.

So basically is there entrepreneurs out there willing to give me advice, was it worth it in the end? Anyone is welcome to give advice on life =] That would be awesome.

Sorry for the long post, but i had to put it into context. The job might of explained it, but I had to explain this stuff has happened all my life and it needs to change.

The grammar and spelling are probably well off, but I'm tired and depressed.

I have my A+ and Network+ certification and studying like a angry gerbil on a treadmill for my CCNA.

 I come to you today asking for any tips on striking a job in this economy. My ideal job would be with the government or state but those seem very lucrative and difficult to get. Monster.com is a joke being 98% head hunters as with most “job” sites. I honestly have no clue were to look for an entry level position. Is there a place I can do temp work to beef up my resume? Or even an internship even though I don't attend a college?

 A little more information about myself, I'm a self made computer geek from Central NJ. It all started with computer games back in the day (Starcraft, Diablo 2, Unreal tournament) and stemmed off into building my first computer. Right then and there I was addicted! It was a beauty too let me tell you :) xp3200+ gig of ram with a 9600 pro... *sigh*. Anyways, from there I mastered the art of removing spyware. Discovered Linux by installing gentoox on my modded xbox. Ran my first ftp server from said xbox too. Plus countless other things since then. Currently my new toys are a Cisco 2611, 2521, 2505 routers paired up with three Cisco Catalyst 2900 switches. Even got a free 100BaseFX card with one of the switches! Anyways thats some insight into my life. Any questions and studying or job tips are welcome.

I think the best way to handle things would be to send me a message with a video of you playing something in our style as suggested by plinko. Nothing huge, just to show your basic skills. I'll then show them to the band and send out my number to whoever they feel would be the best fit. Sound good?

I've been in college for close to seven years (4 in community, 2 1/2 in uni) and I'm still not finished with my B.A. (one unit short). My parents worked hard their whole lives and made many sacrifices to give me and my sibling a chance to succeed and I've given them nothing of value in return. I don't know if I can ever pay them back for all the love, patience, and support they've given me. I've been feeling depressed for a long time, but it's become my habit to repress it until it temporarily subsides, because I'm afraid that if I talk to someone, I'll be judged as an attention whore or a whiner. Considering what I have, I probably shouldn't be complaining at all. Also, I'm not really close with anyone except my family and I don't want to add to their problems. 

I know what I should be doing (which is get a job, lose weight, and graduate), but I find it so difficult to motivate myself that I end up feeling frustrated and making some lousy excuse to delay it. When I actually do make some progress, I start wavering at the first sign of trouble. My job interview was yesterday and they haven't called me back since. I know that it probably takes time, but the feelings of self-doubt have already started creeping in and now I've reverted to feeling like a loser especially after just talking to my mom on the phone and hearing how worried she is about me. Even with an almost-completed college degree, two years of writing experience, and a previously-held summer job in the same line of work, I still can't get a full-time entry-level position that you only need a high school diploma for. It's not even a job that I really want, but money is short and there are worse things to get paid for. I would love to become a creative writer for a video game developer or production company, but the furthest I've gotten is a four month internship that went nowhere. I've tried applying to other places since then, but no one has responded and I don't feel that I currently have the luxury of taking one on, because they don't normally pay.

I feel as if I'm getting nowhere in life and I'm just stuck at a standstill with no hope of recovering. I've thought about suicide a few times in the past. The intensity has varied, but I did get pretty close to the edge around Christmas. I don't know if I want to kill myself, but I don't wish to exist either. I just wish I could make things better and change, but I can't seem to stop myself from sabotaging my life or preventing it from going forward in a positive manner. I don't know what to do. I feel as if my family would be better off without me."

Well, I decided to use the time unemployed on something positive. I'm going to go back to my parents house for a while and focus on writing music. But not just that, I'm going to try and get an internship or an aprenticeship with computers or working wood. I've also inquired about therapy sessions, hopefully the CBT will help. I'm going to try volunteer somewhere too and take up a sport. I also intend to get a book on Self-Esteem and work through it at the same time. This is all to both keep myself busy, meet new people, save money and to practice what I learn in therapy and with the book.

I'm not expecting this to be easy, I'm going to have to put a shit load of work in if I expect to get over this and have a really happy life, but I want to do that. It's going to be hard though, I've dealt with low-level depression all my life but thought I had gotten over it due to improved personal circumstances, but it's come back with a bang recently, I can't expect to get rid of it just like that. Not only that though, I'm also very lazy and haven't stayed committed to anything in my whole life, so it's going to be difficult to stick to this, but I'm going to try my best anyway, anything is better than giving up, sitting in my room all day until I finally work up the courage to kill myself.

What do you all think of my plan? Any advice or suggestions is readily welcomed.

At the small firm I work as a software developer. I'm not sure what kind of work I'd be doing at the large firm (gruntwork like documentation and bug-testing?, development?). I'm concerned I'd be working a lot of unpaid overtime at the large firm (i've heard they are notorious for OT)."

I want to know what novels you redditors recommend because they changed your life, you couldn't put them down, etc.

Feel free to recommend books you had to read for class, if you really liked them.

Info about me: early twenties, I'm a filmmaker/writer/producer, I like magic realism, classic lit, horror. I'll read pretty much anything.

The Magus, John Fowles; 
A Tale of Two Cities, Dickens;

cecnr,12,2010-06-12,"I need to unload a bit about my lonely life.  Sorry for the length...I just want to tell ""someone.""  Can anybody relate or help?  ",bitterpilltoswallow,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cecnr/i_need_to_unload_a_bit_about_my_lonely_life_sorry/,"Dear Reddit, I just need to pour this out anonymously to someone.  I guess I am depressed (?), but I feel like I alternate wildly between being really angry (sometimes) and just defeated, deflated, and sad (often).  I can actually feel a profound heaviness in my chest.  I snap easily at people, but then I also cry at the drop of a hat over the silliest things that I see or hear.  And I do ridiculous stuff like listening to cry-inducing songs on repeat hoping I'll reach catharsis.  Sometimes I don't know how I hold it together.  I almost had a breakdown at a coffeeshop the other day when I must've looked so pitiful that the barista said ""You look sad...is everything okay?""   

I don't think I would ever commit suicide because I do believe that I can make things better for myself somehow (?!)....but I still entertain the idea as a ""fantasy.""  I like to think about how it would give people pause.  And I have to admit that I like thinking about how it would jar and hurt the few people in my life, even though I'm not really that close to anyone.  I thought over time that I would just become numb to the shittiness, but instead, I've become hyper-senstitive and unstable.  I almost feel kind of paranoid.  How fucked up is this:  I like to imagine the ways that I can hurt people's feelings...but then I feel so guilty and terrible and monstrous.  I don't believe I am a good person.

Here's some background on me.  I know it will be kind of long, but I think it will help me to write it out.  (Incidentally, one of the things I find frustrating--whether it's the thought of talking to a therapist or just making small talk in the hope of pursuing friends--is that it takes so long to get people ""caught up."")

I grew up in what was basically a white trash family.  It wasn't physically abusive, but there was an alcoholic stepfather in the picture, the presence of religion, lots of redneck fighting between family members, and their general disgust that I turned out to be gay (I came out as I was graduating from HS in the 90s).  I was always a black sheep for being nerdy and not conventionally masculine.  I lived for school and did well enough to attend a good college on a scholarship.  The future looked bright, but I was also very sheltered, with a really limited worldview.  I did very well in college--on paper--but never found a true passion.  I was just good at getting As in everything, and I focused on the competition rather than the actual learning.  I also struggled with having a different class background from my peers, feeling like I was always backward and culturally ""behind"" no matter what I did.  Anger and resentment occasionally bubbled up, but despite this, I enjoyed a close-knit group of friends in college--a little coterie of about 6 people.  It seemed like we did everything together.  I guess I had mistakenly thought that the rest of life would be like college:  that I'd always have a core group of friends, a default set of people who were like a family to me, considering that I no longer saw my own family.  I've lost that and worry I'll never find it again.

Ever since I graduated from college, going on ten years now, things have slowly crumbled apart.  I had a good job for about two years before quitting, but then I really dicked around, unsure how to proceed.  There was a new plan every couple of months, and it seemed like I never finished anything I started.  This went on for about 7 years.  I began a grad program and quit.  I'd start a job and then leave after six months.  I'd decide I didn't like the city I was in, and then I'd pick up and move.  I think that every time I did this, I was looking for a fresh start, hoping that it would somehow magically be like college and that I'd quickly find a group of friends.  I had a lot of random sex (always protected though I had a lot of different partners).  Sometimes I'd make one good friend for a period, and we'd spend time together constantly in a weird intense platonic friendship way.  But it always ended when someone moved, or there was a falling out, or the friend got a boyfriend.  I never became part of any group...to this day, I only have one friend in my city, and we only hang out together, alone, separate from his other friends who are big partiers.  I guess I was/am kind of like a serial monogamist but with friendships.  And this whole time, I never dated anyone longer than a couple of months.  After I have sex with a guy a couple of times, I find him uninteresting or just annoying.  And if I date someone and begin to care about him emotionally, I lose all sexual attraction to him.  I'm also feeling increasingly unattractive myself and am beginning to put on some weight, though I'm only at 5-10 185 right now when I used to be 5-10 165.  I don't look awful yet, but my friend told me I was ""letting myself go.""

What else...well...I was in terrible debt a few years back (from never keeping a steady job) and had to declare bankruptcy.  While that sucks, it did allow me to get a fresh start, and I am managing my money better.  I was able to start grad school with a smidge of renewed clarity and I think I have a direction for the future (though I've been slow to look for internships and part time work).  I also ended up in a good roommate situation.  So there are upsides to my current situation. 

But I've been in this city (a large one) for several years now, and it still sucks.   I feel so alone and helpless.  Meanwhile, I see all these other people who are happy and active, whether it's straight married couple walking their kids or gaggles of gay guys out for a night on the town.  I don't seem to enjoy the things that others enjoy....I don't like going to bars, and I don't like drinking.  I'm not sportive.  I can't stand theater or even movies.  It's summer, and I don't even like these stupid outdoor festivals that everyone is obsessed with.  I hate dinner parties and other pretentious shit that a lot of the gay guys I encounter are into.  (One of the sub-themes is that I really resent gay culture because of how superficial it feels.)  I sometimes feel like I am defined by what I dislike rather than what I like.

Meanwhile, all of my friends from college are living these absurdly charmed lives.  They're attorneys, consultants, professors, pharmacists, journalists, and so on.  And now they're mostly married and have popped out a kid or two.  They own condos and houses and seem so thrilled by it all.  They've made it look so easy and natural.  I am jealous on one hand, but I also don't want the same things they do...it seems like they've stopped being interesting people. 

A few more things: I'm tremendously impatient with people.  I judge quickly, even though I know I shouldn't.  I have a hard time finding other people who share my values.  I'm an atheist.  I also don't see the appeal of alcohol, and I never use drugs or smoke pot.  I'm not a ladder climber and don't really want to make a lot of money.  I just want to have a job that I enjoy that doesn't make the world any worse and that will pay me enough to live comfortably on (for me that would be $40-45k a year after I'm done with my master's).  

What really gives me the sinking feeling is when I see lonely old people lugging their stuff to the laundry mat or counting change for coffee at McDonald's.  I worry that I will be like that, with no one to care about except a cat or two.

Okay, well....there's obviously more, but I don't want to take up everyone's entire day...this was long enough as-is!  Thanks for letting me dump out all this shit.  I'll take any thoughts or suggestions.  [I suppose I could pursue counseling through my university, but one of the people who works in the counseling center is in my graduate program as a student.  And I can't afford anything private.]"

I'm a mech engineering student, with one more year of school left. I paid for school with loans and grants and will have about $80,000 in debt when I graduate. I'm currently doing an internship but need to figure out what I'll do if I can't find a job after graduating.

I want to get a masters right after I graduate but I'm not sure if that's financially the best decision. 

My old roommate graduated with a mech engineering degree 2 semesters ago and still can't find a job. He's been working at a restaurant to make the required payments on his loan. I want to do my best to avoid going down this path.

I've thought about possible options and I can only think of two possibilities if I can't find a job after graduating: move back in with my parents and find whatever work I can find to pay my tuition, go for a masters or a phd and keep building on my debt (some of my student loans are from private banks and going to grad school will result in me having to pay extra money toward these loans).

Another option is for me to do a co-op for the next two semesters and take a year off from school. This would increase my chances of getting a job but going through 4th year classes after working for a year might be difficult. I'm not sure if I'll even get accepted to a co-op but until now I haven't even considered doing it.

I'm really worried. Are there other options for me?

Thanks

What's the strangest way you've landed a job?",itsbusinesstime,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cfg7w/reddit_i_got_an_internship_at_the_pentagon/,"I'm a big political wonk - I'm going to graduate with a double major in History and Political Science. I'm also a giant geek. So naturally, I would be a HUGE fan of Wired Magazine blogs ""Danger Room"" and ""Threat Level"", which discuss cybersecurity and technology and warfare. It's fantastic, highly recommended!

Anyway a few months ago, Wired announced that the DoD was hosting a blogger's roundtable because they were lifting their 3-year ban on social networking websites. There was a panel of social media czars from the Pentagon. I had done numerous research papers on the influence of social media, government, revolutions, etc. so this was definitely a field I was interested in exploring. I was streaming it live from work, and I recognized a lot of the bloggers who called in. 

So I decided to go balls to the wall and email one of the panelists about possibly getting an internship with him. I looked on his government profile page and he didn't have any contact info, but the info page for the live stream had his twitter account. So I decided why not, and DM'd him a message asking for his contact info. I got an email address, and I sent him an email detailing my academic accomplishments, my interests, and what I was looking for.

A few days later I got a reply, thanking me for contacting him and praising my accomplishments. He said he didn't have anything available under him, but he'd float my email around. So my email floated around the Pentagon for a few days, before I got a reply from an HR person. She said that I was specifically requested to apply for an internship pool for paid interns, so I sent in my resume. I ended up not getting that, but she also put me down for an unpaid internship. 

I leave for the Pentagon on Friday. :) 

I guess Twitter does have a use for something, right?

tl;dr I used Twitter to contact someone at the Pentagon who helped me get an internship.

Female, rather average looking, white, theatre major going to school in Michigan at a private college.
I've been with my boyfriend for almost three years now, we got together in high school and he is the first person I've ever fell in love with. We've dealt with long distance, going first to different high schools and living a good 15-20 minute drive from each other (not too terrible) to going to different colleges 1.5 hours away. Well, he had to wait a year our freshman year to go to college because of surgery so here's a break down.

Year 1: End of High school (different schools), I went to college 2.5 hours away and he stayed home because of surgery
Year 2: Feshman to Sophomore years in college. We both were home for the summer. He went to school and I went back to school and we went down to a 75 minute drive from one another but he didn't have a car so a bus ride to see each other on weekends was 3 hours. It didn't have happen often
In the midst of Year 3: Sophomore year of college and I went to New Jersey for the summer for an amazing theatre internship while he is at home.

I think it's also important to point out that I don't have a car so he does 95% of the driving. He's also a chemical engineering major so it's very different than my theatre major.

So what is my question? I love him, I'm not even thinking of breaking up with him because, to me, it's not an option. He makes my life better, I am happy, and I couldn't ask for anything more. I love him. Yes it may be that first romance love or something but I'm genuinely happy. He's the best guy in the world.

My question is how do I keep this alive? I'm in New Jersey and he's in MIchigan. It's a 15 hour drive from me to him and I don't have a car here and he has a 9-5 job Mon-Fri. I do my best (and usually succeed) in talking to him at least once a day but I want to do something more to let him know that I'm missing him and love him and wish he was here.

This internship is starting to make me think a lot about my future. At this time, I am currently on a path to graduate with a **Bachelor's in English AND Chinese**. But, I really want to see if I can change that and pursue a **Major in Chinese and a Double-minor in English and Business,** instead of the double major. However, I simply might not have enough time to complete a Business minor so I may be stuck with the double major. 

I've been to China once for a week, and will be going back the entire spring semester next year to study. I also am going to apply for a Government scholarship program for the Critical Languages, which may allow me to study during next summer as well.

So my question is, what kind of careers can I pursue after my education? Is additional education needed? How much would the change help, if it is possible? I will most likely graduate with Honors, and will have served as sort of a TA for 3 years. The internship is at a fortune 500 company.

I've been fighting depression and anxiety since I was in middle school (30 now). 


I was in a 5 1/2 year relationship which imploded due to my depression and my inability to get my shit together. That was 1 1/2 years ago. I am still madly in love with my ex and have recurring nightmares about losing her (I've cut off all contact with her).


It took me 9 years to get my BFA in graphic design, a field that I never wanted to be in the first place. I was extremely good at it, to the point where I easily got internships at top design firms. I hated it, but was good at it. That is why I stuck with it.


$5,000 a month allowance from my wealthy parents for the majority of my adult life has fucked me over. I finally cut myself loose because the free money was killing my sense of self worth.


I've been financing my life for the past two years with credit card debt and odd jobs. However my debt is growing, $60,000 and counting. 


I struggle with my work ethic every fucking day. I can barely hold a job for longer than a month, because I'd become depressed, anxious and just drop out. 


My physical health is good. I regularly run and swim, and am rather cut.


I've gone to therapy, been on countless of medication, tried everything I could think of to get better. In a way I am better, but lately (over the past several months) I'm beginning to lose it again. 
 

I'm tired.


I'm fairly good looking and get laid now and then, but I've since become discontented with random and not so random sex. My ex set the bar so high, nothing else compares (and yes I've reminded myself of all bad things that transpired during the relationship, but she gives me an immense satisfaction that I am unable to find in another person).


I struggle with constant ennui (a form of depression), I've had numerous of hobbies and interests but they alway fall to the wayside.  It's extremely frustrating because I know that I'm more than capable of learning new skill and hobbies, but nothing holds my attention for long. So I've become a mediocre jack of all trades, master of none.


I have a respectable number of friends who love me (and vice versa), but sometimes it's a burden to hang out with them. 


I've come far in the past 2 years but I've hit a plateau, and feel like I'm spinning my wheels in a sandy incline. Slowly sliding backwards.


I'm slowly growing more cynical, bitter, and discontented with myself and life in general. I'm tired of fighting so hard all the damn time. 


I promised myself that I won't think about suicide (there were one serious attempt and countless of flirtations). Haven't seriously thought about it for two years, but lately they have been cropping up again.


I'm the kind of person who plays a perfect game and will reload a saved game if I make a mistake. I feel the same thing about my life. Due to a series of bad choices, I'm thirty years old with shitload of debt, no career, no passion and no idea where to head next. I feel like I've fucked up, and my options are restricted.


Life has stopped feeling like an adventure for a long time (since I was a teen, actually). Now I'm just fighting, going through the motions. For what? In a million years, none of this will matter. I'm an atheist and see the world as a largely deterministic place with discrete bits of information smashing into each other giving rise to different variables.


I'm tired of being constantly dispirited. I'm tired of not having something I can look forward to. I'm tired of fighting my mental illness.


Before you guys freak out and track down my IP to call the cops on me. I'm not in danger, nor really desire death.


I just need something... I don't know, something to convince me that all of this is worth it."

This is a throw away account. Anyway, I'm currently in an internship. The thing is, a million people would probably want this internship. It's owned by a very famous person in pop culture. I got the internship, even though it's not in the field I want to pursue, because I thought I would be using skills in the field I do want to pursue. I know all internships aren't perfect, but I literally do not do anything during work. I spent 8 hrs surfing reddit and I sent 3 emails that my ""mentors"" could have sent themselves. I ask for work constantly. They tell me to send someone an email (that they could have sent them selves). Also, there is no HR at the company, no real concrete internship program, and I get paid $125 a week for commuting compensation. 

I'm planning on quitting, should I tell them the truth, that this job in this company that many droll over and is highly acclaimed, is not well run, I don't get to explore different skills, and I'm not doing ANYTHING. Or should I lie and make something up like: a person dropped out of a grant and I was the runner up. I'm going to take the grant and do that program instead, sorry for dropping out.

My Aunt lives alone in a really nice community, which benefits me.

I go to the community pool one afternoon, and find 2 younger women (early 30s) hanging out in the pool. I said hello, and proceed to sit in the jacuzzi. One of the women came over and talked to me. She told me a few things about herself, that she's married, and has 2 very young kids. This woman was obviously from Russia, because she had a thick accent, was blonde, and basically gorgeous. We made small talk, and it turns out she lives a few condos down from my Aunt.

A few weeks later, I see her at the pool. We talk more, and she proceeds to tell me how she's in the midst of a divorce. Her husband moved to another State, and she's been here alone for a few months. At this point, I'm having fantasies in my head, but I didn't think anything of it. 

The Summer rolls along, we talked often, and one day she unexpectedly knocks on my door. She asked me to go on a hike with her. Of course, I was down. We went hiking the next morning, had lunch, and she said she'd call me later that night. My hopes were up, but I never heard from her...

The next day, there's a power outage in the afternoon. The power is scheduled to be off until the following morning. My neighbor (the Russian) comes over, and asks me if I want to hang out for pizza at her place. Of course, I'm down. I arrive around dusk, and there's candles lit throughout the house. She had just put her young (1 and 4year old) kids to bed, and offered me a drink.

A few drinks later, we're sitting outside, and she puts her feet up on my thighs. I start to touch her legs, and she quivers, and says ""I haven't had a man, other than my husband, touch me since I was 18."" She's 31 now. One thing leads to another, and we have AMAZING sex in her place.

**Here's where things got bad:**

W'ere going at it, round 2, and I hear a rustling down stairs. I didn't think anything of it, and then I suddenly heard a voice from downstairs, asking ""Mommy, is Daddy home?"" 

My heart sank. It was her 4 year old son. She ran downstairs, tended to him, and put him back to bed.

I felt awful.

We continued to have sex when the kids were at school until I moved away, 1 week later..."

Here's the deal.  I had an internship for this company, a small startup, who agreed to hire me during the school year as well as over the summer.  The project was small, but half of my wages would be paid with federal grant money and the other half from the company.  This is all okay.  Then, out of nowhere the CEO has us work on a totally different project, which is cool and all, but failed to tell me until about a week before summer break that ""oh, we don't have any money for this project, and you won't be paid for this yet because the grant doesn't cover the new company.""  Meanwhile, I racked up a number of hours for the previous ""company,"" (about 3 months worth).  Then summer comes around and I'm stuck with this work I don't get paid for.  I finally tell him I don't have any incentive to work on this project  and he fires me because I am not ""100% committed to the project.""  He tells me that my final paychecks will come soon once the grant comes through and that my work for the other project will be compensated for once he gets funding for it.  It's clear to me that this guy has no up front cash, since he has screwed over interns in the past over payment.  It has been a month since he said he would pay me for my duties.  I have inquired multiple times about it to him and all he tells me is ""the grant takes time.""  I finally contacted the department of labor, and they have an agent on the case (as of about 3 days ago). He is moving out of state soon and I am afraid that he will take the money I earned and run.  Is there anything I can do at the moment or should I wait for the Dept. of Labor to come through?  Has anyone ever had an experience similar?  Any advice is much appreciated.

cgs4z,2,2010-06-19,I am about to finish architecture school and I don't want to be an architect anymore.,iamabe,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cgs4z/i_am_about_to_finish_architecture_school_and_i/,"Hi reddit.  I've lurked for years but this is my first post, and I need your help!

This is a story I’m sure lots of you have heard before.  I'm going into my last year of architecture school and I'm wondering if this is really what I want to do with the rest of my life.  I started thinking about this last year after my first internship at an architecture firm.  Despite the relative variety of my work compared to my peers (some weeks I built models, some weeks I worked on drawings) I still mostly just drafted in autocad on a computer all day.  1pm - 6pm was brutal and I found it impossible to focus (thanks reddit).  The same thing is happening at my second summer internship.  

Architecture school is different.  I usually to do good work and I like the challenges of my projects.  In a typical semester I get some variety, and despite getting no sleep, I feel like the processes of modelmaking, sketching, and designing in general are rewarding. But now I'm realizing just how different the lifestyle of a student is from an architect.  Architects at all levels seem to do the same shit day after day.  I have nightmares of bottomless piles of boring drawings of walls and square rooms and insane deadlines that require I work 60+ hour weeks.

I'm also nervous about the real world because despite being a good student (straight A's in four years of studio), I have been last to get a job during both of my co-ops.  This is partly because I have been late to apply to jobs and because I have less experience than my peers, and thus they are things I can improve, but it still makes me worried.  

What I like about architecture/design:
- creative, graphic work
- ownership of my work
- design challenges
various mediums: 2d/3d, physical models, etc.

What I don’t like:
- the real world = principal architects design while everyone else executes
- carpal fucking tunnel syndrome from working with a mouse for 9 hours a day
- boring and repetitious schedule

Cue 100 “work is boring, get used to it” comments.  I get that, but who else has been in this position?  Are there any other achitecture or design students here on reddit?  How did you deal with these problems?  What other fields could I look at?  Any suggestions are welcome - seriously.  Graphic design is the obvious recommendation but it has a similar set of problems.  I’ve been told I should move to England and become a mechanic for American Muscle cars.  I don’t really know what it means but the idea excites me.  

tl;dr - What are some jobs I can get with my architecture degree that allow me to work normal hours (40ish) that let me do more than click my arms off in AutoCAD all day?"
cgthf,7,2010-06-19,"Reddit, is this really an internship?",SiliconSurfer,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cgthf/reddit_is_this_really_an_internship/,"Hi all,

So I was fortunate when I was younger to be part of this group that produced a great piece of software. The founders were two mentors of mine and myself. The mentors were very passionate hard-working guys. Together, we hit a niche market and produced a great open-source tool that is now being used in education.

Now I'm in my last year of college and got a great internship, which pays very well - almost as much as a professional. Sure this is a great gig and with a startup company but I'm not sure if this is an internship or if I'm being viewed as cheap labor?

I'm the only coder....and considered an intern. I basically am programming all of the code while the two other guys work on brainstorming/sit on meetings. On top of that, they work maybe like 8 hours a day? In the last project we all would work 10-14 hours a day. Watching them leave early really hurts my motivation and I feel less inclined to do the work. I feel like I have the title of an intern when I'm really doing the work of a salaried professional or founder. Is this how a startup normally is? Based on the reading I've done, I always thought the founders should be sleeping like 5-6 hours a day in the office working their ass off. 

I know I'm fortunate to have a great intern salary, etc.....but mentally it's difficult to not be outraged when I feel like they give the title of an ""intern"" because they see interns as ""cheap labor"" and that way I don't need to get an equity stake.

Also, I had given them a few books to read on basic technical terms so we could all be at the same page - but they haven't even cracked them open. Worst of all, because of this they don't understand the scope or complexity fully of what they're asking me to do. At meetings, I feel like I can't even have a brainstorm session for coding algorithms because they don't even know the fundamentals of a framework we're using.
Is this how working at all startups/companies is? Feeling used? If that, fuck I'm going straight into a different industry while I can. We have venture capital and the VC guy works his ass off as well.

Sorry, I crossposted this into programming but got no responses.


Edit: I think it'd be beneficial to give my salary, 70-80k. I feel like that's borderline salary rather than intern... I feel like I'm worth a decent amount just because of my previous experience, publications, and other offers. I really don't want to sound like one of those well-off people complaining about nothing because I know other people have it worse (~10% unemployment)....I'm just not sure if this is still acceptable."

We had dated in high school, but broke up after a few months. I called her up one day a few years later and we picked up the spark. I was in college and she was still back home, but we made the long distance thing work for several months before she came up and visited me. A few days before the first time seeing her since high school, she told me she had gained a lot of weight and had been cutting herself a year after we broke up. I was extremely pissed about the latter. Why she didn't tell me that I don't really understand, and felt I couldn't forgive. The weight wasn't really an issue as I had gained some since high school myself, but the fact that she had lied about being 100lbs overweight and not 15lbs was disappointing. I had gained about 30lbs since high school and for two months before she came up, worked 20lbs of it off.

When I first saw her, I felt happy, but not as happy as I thought I would feel. She had lied to me about the weight and the cutting, only telling me these things 2 days before the trip up. I loved her, but I was hurt by her dishonesty as I was very open about what had happened since we last saw each other. Still, she was the person I was in love with and I was glad to finally see her again. In our time together during that first visit, she made me very happy, and was wonderful to be around. When she had to leave I was sad because we didn't know how long we would be apart. A few months after the last time she came up to visit me, she told me she had been thinking about cutting herself again though. I was pretty shocked, I guess I thought she was happy, but being back at home made her the opposite. I reacted in a pretty bad way. I wanted to be out of the relationship for what I think are selfish reasons, but didn't want to own up to it and break it off. I worried what would happen if we broke up and if she would hurt herself again. I felt trapped. We started talking less, and I began talking to another girl more. I did something stupid, the other girl and I had phone sex, and then I broke it off because of how wrong it felt. I tried forgetting about it, and focused more on our relationship, but eventually told her out of guilt.

She was pretty devastated, and it took her a long time to forgive me. She started seeing a therapist to work through her issues with self-esteem and cutting and we eventually made it through that rough spot. Our relationship strengthened and we decided to give living together a try while I had my apartment to myself over the summer. I started encouraging her to work out with me and bought healthy groceries and we started living better. It kind of worked. Though I couldn't get her to commit to doing daily exercises with me, we each ended up losing 10 lbs and she was happier than she had ever been. She had to move back in the fall and I was going to do internships for a year. In the spring, I moved to a new city to do another internship, begging her to move in with me.

She agreed and moved up shortly after I started, and we've been together since. I've also moved back to school to finish my degree. Since she's been living with me, I haven't gone out with friends more than twice. My social life was pretty much on hold. This summer, she's been working long hours, leaving me with a lot of time by myself. I've started hanging out with old friends more when she's at work, and I realize how much I missed and needed to be involved with some group of friends. Every time I have suggested doing things with my friends though, it's been an argument to convince her to come, hence why we hadn't done it almost at all. I could list all of the problems I have with her and with the relationship in general, but I think all that really matters is that I'm starting to be unhappy being with her. Her self-esteem issues, I feel, are holding us back from living a full life. We don't go out anymore, I can't get her to stop buying bad foods or quit bad habits, and every time we try to change 'together' I always end up doing it by myself while she doesn't change at all. I feel like I've been delaying this because I've been holding out hope things would get better. Now I'm at a point where I just don't see that really happening. 

tldr: The major things I have a problem with are: lack of confidence and motivation, content with a very sedentary lifestyle, no plans for school or career, very different interests, and no willpower to change. We dated in high school, she has self-esteem issues, and she cut herself before we got back together. I cheated when I found out and felt trapped at the time. She's since been to therapy. Life together has been easy because we haven't done anything at all. We never go out with friends. We have sex maybe twice a week, and I still find her attractive, but not as much as I used to. I find confidence and intelligence attractive and she's been letting her brain rot not studying or doing anything. I worry though that that's just the way it is because we hear about these relationship problems all the time. Is it worth it to try to pull through? How long is too long to wait? I do love her, but the spark is almost gone. I don't get excited to see her anymore and that bothers me."

I just graduated college, and we do not live in the same state, and she goes to college in another state that I do not want to return to (we met there). However, she's in my area for the summer (got an internship to be near me) and wants to hang out with my friends, drink, grab coffee/food etc. 

I'm conflicted since I care about her, I don't want to hurt her, especially since she never hurt me. We broke up right when she got in town, rather than in a fight (we had been in that cycle before), and when it was a rational thought, not an emotional reaction. She took the news well, and already wants to see me and call me.

I'll be 25 in less than four months. I did everything I was supposed to in life, worked really hard in school, got good grades, did the honors/AP classes and NHS in highschool, went to a state school with a scholarship for 4 of the 4.5 years I was there. I was a CIS major, which was like 3rd or 4th choice down the list.  I have a lot of different interests like music performance, every aspect of filmmaking, audio engineering, photography, writing, art in general, etc. I like science as well, but this was basically business/basic IT knowledge...  I've worked on computers since I was in like 4th grade, and I'm not as good as a lot of other people, but my parents and everyone else told me I should do it because I was ""good at it"". I burned out. I worked at a helpdesk for an airline for a summer and I hated it. I was good at programming only because I put so much time into it, otherwise, it frustrated the shit out of me. It was ok, but it didn't turn me on like my other interests do.

Fast forward.. I graduated in December '08 when the recession hit the fan and didn't realize that my whole life, I never really put much thought into what I wanted to do with all this schooling. I ran out of student health insurance, ran out of antidepressants, racked up debt from being unemployed, finally got a job delivering pizzas a few months later and I've been doing that for a little over a year now. I finally got state health insurance since I'm below the poverty line so I got back on antidepressants, which kind of helped.

I've spent almost 20 years here, the city I grew up in, and I'm kind of getting tired of it. The only reason I'm still here is because my grandparents moved here a year ago, and I don't know if moving would even change anything. I miss the ocean. I love to travel and see new places, but like I said, I don't know. 

My friend recommends me to his friend, who has started a successful a small business (my friend's dad is one of the clients) and wants me to code for him using Sharepoint and SQL and C#. Said he would start me at 12/hr, which is better than my job now, and he said he would train me and all that because I'm such a noob. He said in a year I could be making double that if we get enough clients, and in two years I can have people working under me, and in five years I can be some kind of regional manager. Says he wants to help me succeed, but I have to work hard, and when I'm not working 8 hours a day, I'm learning how to code more. Basically eat sleep code/do tech support, every single day. 

This guy is really smart no doubt, his business is solid, the job is an opportunity most people would kill for, but for some reason.. it doesn't excite me at all. I had a really sick feeling driving away from the first and second days I worked with him, like I was settling. I would only be doing this for the money. I don't get any pleasure out of doing this much at all. I just kept thinking, is this it? Is this what it's like to grow up? You just do the responsible thing like everyone else and take the job that pays well, even if it means focusing all your time on that job with no time left for the things you like? 

People I know think I'm crazy for not taking this for the most part.  I've heard all sides to this same argument, the whole ""do what makes you happy, follow your dreams, have fun"" thing and the ""be responsible, make a living, just have some hobbies thing like everyone else"" mantra from my parents and other people. I'm just very confused and I don't know what to tell this guy. If I try it out and bail, I'll feel like I'm disappointing him and my friend who recommended me to this guy. I also feel like way off in the future if nothing works out, I'll be like god, why didn't I just take that? On the other hand, I also feel like this is trapping me, and that eventually I'll burn out just like I did at school and my internship... doing the ""responsible thing"" even though I'm not happy.  I'm tired of that.

Sorry it's almost 4:30AM and I'm delusional.. I can't sleep because I don't know what to do. If you have any advice at all, I would really appreciate something objective."
chb7o,13,2010-06-21,How should you charge for web development?,cartoon_gun,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/chb7o/how_should_you_charge_for_web_development/,"I'm doing some web development for some family friends and need to make up an invoice but I don't know how much to charge. I'm a college student and am creating relatively simple websites. Since I'm just an amateur and don't know anyone else in the field, I'm kinda lost.

* How much do web developers charge?
* What do you charge for?
* Does it depend on the type of content?
* Do you ask for a contract?
* Any other tips for me?

I'm not sure how much a web dev usually charges but I figure I will charge much less, around the usual amount an intern gets paid (~$12-20 per hr.). I haven't had anyone sign a contract, but I was reading about it and think it might be a good idea in the future.

Overview of what I do/know:

* I've done 3 websites so far
* The websites are for small businesses
* Websites are more informational with little or no dynamic content
* Write the sites in html/php/js/css
* Very little backend dev is required

Any other tips are appreciated."

I recently met a girl through a friend because this girl and my friend are coming to my college next year.  When I first saw her I was very interested from the start.  She came up to visit with my friend at school, and I remember sitting down in the dining hall the first day she was on campus and I saw her RIGHT away. Weird coincidence but I thought that was interesting. We went to see the band State Radio that night and just hung out 
After her visit we started texting a bunch and I ended up having a dream about her where we on this balcony and she walked up next to me and was about to say something but then my dream changed.  I told her about this and said that I should take her out to dinner on a nice balcony sometime so she could tell me what she was gonna say to which she responded ""That sounds perfect! It's a date!""  
We kept talking and I didn't bring that up until like 2 weeks later when I went somewhere and found the perfect spot.  I told her ""I think I found the perfect balcony to take you"" and she says ""That text just made my day :)"" 
We had dinner last week with our mutual friend and she picked me up from the train station (I commute to and from NYC every day for an internship) and we talked the whole way to the place we were meeting for dinner. I found out from our friend that she basically volunteered to pick me up 
She's leaving for 2 weeks to go to Italy and I just sent her a message pretty much saying that even though we've only met twice, I feel like there's something there and that I wanted her to think about it while she was away.  I don't know if this was a wise move, but I know that she called our mutual friend about it because she wrote on her wall and it showed up in my feed on facebook haha.  
My main concern is that I don't know if I scared her off, and I hope I didn't, but at the same time I felt like I needed to say something because I don't wanna put myself in the friend zone and I hate waiting and not knowing.  But I'm usually right about these things.  
I told my last girlfriend how I felt about her within like the first week because idk I just have an instinct about this stuff. Exactly a month later we were dating.  
Normally I don't have trouble reading girls when it comes to stuff like this but I can't tell if she was just a really nice person and I just scared the shit out of her or if she hasn't answered me because she's thinking about it or doesn't want to. 

What does everyone think?

TL;DR Recently met a girl, had what seems like flirty interactions/somewhat romantic shit, but I can't really tell if she's just really nice or actually flirting/into me, told her straight up how I felt and she's gonna be gone for 2 weeks on vacation in Italy.  I decided to do that because I wanted to take myself completely out of the friend zone but now I feel like I might just have ruined any chance I have.  I can't tell if she's not answering because she read it and didn't know what to say or if she just got freaked out and I totally scared her off because of my inability to wait."

Yesterday, I was using my younger siblings computer to check my email and noticed that there was a random email w/ password saved on gmail. Being curious, I clicked on it and saw that it was a email address used for online dating sites. At first i was confused and didn't understand wth was going on, as there were very few emails, about 2 or 1 email for every 2 months. I saw that there were a few contacts on the gchat, so decided to look at the chat history and saw bunch of exchanges. Reading them I realized that its a male who is talking and is basically looking for one night stands. Confused as hell, I decided to go on firefox and look at the password for the email, and there i realized that this is my dads account. The email address is also something he says, and reading into the conversations, he mentioned the location of his work which again points at him, so there are alot of evidence showing that its his account. Also I went to the dating site, and saw that he has had the account for more than 2 years Seeing this on Fathers day, I was shocked and had really hard time controlling myself, but a friend of mine help me get through the night and i pretty much slept for 12 hrs( usually sleep very little, so its pretty unusual for me to sleep that much). I would have never expected my parents to cheat on each other, as they seemed to be good with other. I do remember them fighting when i was younger, but ever since my younger sibling was born, they had been a lot better, so seeing this is just mind shocking.

So now, the next morning, I'm not sure what i should do and I'm extremely confused. Currently I hate my dad and I want to confront him, but i'm not sure if this is the best idea. To begin with, I'm an intern in the same company as him, so I commute with him everyday. I'm worried that I might not be able to control myself in the car with him. This internship can also help me alot for getting a job once i get out of college, so passing up on it is an extremely bad idea. Next, I have a younger sibling who is entering first grade, so I'm sure losing your father at that age is going to be extremely hard. My mom will have an extremely hard time to take of my brother by himself, as she has already begun cutting back on her work hours since she is finding it hard to work full time. I have an older sibling who lives far away from us and has faced the same problem( the person cheated), so not doing very well emotionally, therefore i haven't said anything yet. I'm on my last year of college, so I can move in with my mom and help her out, but for the next year we don't have anyone who can be with my mom. Also i know that emotionally, for her to find out about this, she will be traumatized. I strongly believe that my mom deserves to know the truth, but I'm not sure if the truth is worth it.

Reddit, please help me... I need advice on what to do. Should I confront my dad and make him confess to my mom? Or tell my mom and sister and ask her to divorce him? Also as for divorcing goes, how could i know that she will be well off, as my dad makes the majority of the house income and I'm not sure if my mom can make enough to take care of the family. Please i need help

I kept some details out, such as the gender of my siblings and all and obviously this is a throw away account since i have friends who know my account on reddit. I have an older account, so if they mods want to check to see if i'm not trolling i can send a message or something from it. I know ask reddit has been getting trolled lately, but honestly i don't have anyone else to ask...."

What can I do?",futuremidmgmt,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/chl7x/im_one_of_the_luckiest_people_on_the_planet_and/,"I say I'm lucky because I'm a well off, white, urban American with two loving parents, a brother, and a life virtually free from hardship.

I’ve recently graduated from a top 15 university completely without debt, thanks to my wonderful grandparents, I've never had to work to eat or have a roof over my head (but I worked anyway), and this summer I hit the jackpot. 

I'm working for one of the ""Big Three"" tech companies in a cushy, overpaid internship where I work 9-10 hours a day and get paid more than should be legal for a 22yr old.  I honestly hate to tell people how much I make, because I feel sick that I'm making this much money when 98% of the world work so much harder for so much less.  Of course I enjoy not having to struggle, but almost every day I think that I've done nothing to deserve this.  

If all goes according to plan, I'll get a full time offer this summer, start work next year making just below six figures with a raise every fiscal year, and eventually become a mid-level dev manager with an office that has windows.  Maybe I’ll even leave after saving enough to pay for my kid’s education, form a startup, sell it and become a VP at some middle of the road consulting firm, and live out my life on a golf course.  Because that's what people like me do.

That's the plan, and it scares the shit out of me.  Sometimes I decide that I'll do anything but 9-5 overpaid desk job. But every time I can't help but think that, if I were to do that, I'd be giving up the life that all parents want their kids to have, that I'd be just another wealthy, upper-middle class asshole who didn't know what he had until he threw it in the face of those who.

When I was in high school, I was heartbroken when I turned down a full-ride to a (very good) local university to attend my ""elite private institution"".  I felt horrible because it was right then when I realized that doors fly open for me due to who I am and where I'm from, but I'm not allowed to hold them open for anyone else.  I couldn't just give my scholarship to a bright kid who couldn't afford the prep school and AP classes.  I can’t give my 20 years of private school to the homeless teenager begging for change, even though they might be able to be just as qualified, if not more so, than I am.  I realize this, more now than ever before, and it’s seriously fucking me up.  

**tl;dr (Because holy shit that was more typing than I expected)**

I'm an upper-middle class college grad whose life has unfolded before him without pain or worry.  I'm one of the luckiest people on this planet, yet my ease of success and lack of ability to help others with the same makes me sick.

I'd be irresponsible giving it all up for no good reason, but I'm feeling trapped in my impending future.  I don't want to always feel like everything I do is just a stepping stone to a corner office, and I don't want to feel like I'm not allowed to help others through the doors that opened so easily for me.  I want to keep ""moving up"", but I want to get satisfaction from it and be able to bring others with me, but that doesn’t seem to be allowed.

**So my question is this: ** What do I do, in the face of a successful future, when I feel like that future wasn't earned but given?  How can I use my success to help out those around me while still making my family proud?

(This is a throwaway acct, as my other one is my name and it could be awkward if my employer found it.  And sorry that was so goddamn long.  I get wordy, sue me. If you actually read it all I'll send you a cookie and a blowjob, though the blowjob might get lost in the mail)

This is actually my first post over here on Fitness, but I have to say that all the lurking paid off. After getting advice from this reddit I went from 181 at the end of October to 150 as of today (I'm 5'11''.) SO, first and foremost, thanks for all the help and suggestions, even though I'm not quite the participator.

But, seriously, I have to ask, how the hell do you get rid of the pudge? after dropping 30 pounds I still have this little bit of a pooch on my stomach, and even though I'm still shedding weight it doesn't seem to be coming off from my stomach. I can't quite figure out where it's coming from.

But seriously, what's the best way to take out that damn stomach pudge?

Edit: WOW, talk about a huge flow of comments. It turns out I snoozed after I posted this due to work the next morning. So, adding a few things:

* I'm a male, and at most recent weighing I'm about ~152-154
* My daily routine consists of around 60 minutes of cardio (usually half running, half cycling, sometimes all running) at ~165-175 bpm heart rate
* Every other day I do 3 sets of 40 crunches, 3 sets of 20 reverse crunches, 3 sets of planks for 35 seconds, 3 sets of 15 push-ups, and 3 sets of walking lunges (usually around 15-20). This has been going up since starting at 10/10/20/7/10, etc. every two or three weeks.
* I don't have the moobs, just a little bit of pooch right above my pelvic area in the front.
* Nope, not a drinker
* My work schedule is insane (lol intern) so I don't have the most time in the world to execute a proper diet
* The ""skinny-fat"" look is probably the most descriptive, but I feel like a douche whenever my weight goes up after being 180ish for a good year, so I don't have that much patience for that.

I'm looking to start a web based company although I am not a designer myself.  Since I'm not exceptionally rich and I don't want a venture capitalist running my company I'd rather take on some designers/programmers as partners rather than hiring them as employees.  The only problem is that I'm not sure exactly how many people I should be taking on and what specific skill sets they should have.

The site would allow users to review different festivals and events they have attended while traveling and also upload any pictures they have of the event.  Generally, the site layout would be pretty similar to Yelp.  I would want people to be able to search for festivals by typing in the name and location of the festival, looking at festivals on a map (via Google Maps most likely), or by looking at a calendar for a city/region.  

I'm hoping to take on just two or three people and then possibly have some interns for some of the more basic stuff

Any help you can offer regarding this situation would be very much appreciated.  I'm not sure if there is a better subreddit for this question so if it is inappropriate for this one please direct me to the best spot.   Also, if you think that you're the person I'm looking for send me a message.

Alternatively, it could 'alias' field from outlook, because that's what we use here for emails, and just put the domain on the end.

So I'm curious...I've never really done much web developing. What's the most common way(s) to defend against XSS? I know PHP has some built-in methods to filter out characters, but those can usually be circumvented by clever hackers - especially with tools such as the XSS Cheat Sheet at hand."

cil7c,18,2010-06-24,EE vs CE,davidb_,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/cil7c/ee_vs_ce/,"I'm graduating with a degree in Computer Engineering and I've noticed during my internships that a decent number of people in industry have a misconception of what a CE knows (some of my managers were very surprised to learn that I know VHDL/Verilog and VLSI tools). So, I am wondering what your opinions are.

It seems that at some schools CE focuses on programming (almost to the point of being a Software Engineer), while EE focuses on hardware (both digital and analog). 

At my school, EE's get a very small amount of programming, architecture, and focus more on analog design. CE's get a great deal more of programming, architecture, and VLSI, focusing more on digital design. Of course, the curicuulum is somewhat flexible and either degree can focus more on the individual's interests.

So, I'm just wondering what the overall opinion of the difference between the degrees is. When you hear CE do you think only of software?"

ciqzl,2,2010-06-24,What can I do to get into Law School after this?,needhelp08,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ciqzl/what_can_i_do_to_get_into_law_school_after_this/,"So here is a quick background on myself.

- I go to a top 20 University in the states.

- I am going to be a Junior

- I have done some internships, etc with law firms.

- I am starting to study for the LSAT now. 

- I am a political science major, minor in ethics, and will have some economics classes under my belt (if i can't get a minor in economics).

Okay, now essentially I had a traumatic experience during my sophomore year in which I lost an individual I knew for roughly 8 years (friend, my age) in an accident. I have a fairly busy schedule at this school, play sports, plus a lot of other stuff, and at the time was following the pre-med track (even though I had began to grow tired of it). I began to have trouble keeping up, dealing with the friend, trying to keep everything in check and all essentially pushed me over my limit. As a result I failed one course (although before it happened I had tried to get a medical withdraw due to the stress of my friend passing- this withdraw which would have done nothing against my GPA to hurt it- and I had attempted to ask them to let me just take the course over the summer- but they said I HAD to have had a breakdown for this to occur). And was FALSELY accused of cheating in another course. During the whole process to get the cheating thing resolved I was given bad advice, told I might be expelled etc. Of course when all was done the cheating incident ended up being taken care of by a Dean and voided (6 months later). The part of the whole incident that angers me is that because they took so long to resolve it, my grades for the 1st semester came out with an F for the course. As such they cannot undo this and I get to average my new grade form this summer retaking the course and the ""f"" i received for cheating- even though the dean proved I didn't. There is no recourse here, and I have fought every possible angle I can.
Anyway, since then I was able to re-take the ""cheating"" course (pre-med related) this summer, I have a decent grade in the course now,  the mark of cheating is being removed the beginning of my senior year.

Now follows my question...
Due to the whole previous statement my gpa is a 2.9. What can I do to get into a decent law school- or what should I be doing in general? Mind you I had roughly a gpa of a 3.6-7 before the cheating incident, I was in student government, and am just generally involved at my college. I also do well on standardized tests, meaning that I think if I study well enough, I feel that I should do well on the LSAT. 

I am just asking what advice some of you have as I am extremely frustrated that a single event (THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED with a simple withdraw do to a death, and the cheating accusation being withdrawn early on) during my 21 years of school- coming from a great high school gpa, great act/sat, awesome first year gpa at college, working my way up to start on varsity teams in college, etc-  has seemingly placed some of my goals out of my reach. 

edit 1: Thanks so far for the advice by the way- at the risk of trying not to sound like I'm complaining- I honestly am just looking for some support and help on attacking this thing the correct way so that I get to where I want to go."

It took me one more year to get together with her - so it is safe to say that i have incredibly strong feelings to her since quite some time (especially keeping in mind that I am only 22). Everything is/was perfect - a very good level of trust, open dialog about pretty much everything, first serious relationship for both of us, first orgasm (for her) and first ""i love you"" (for both of us). It is important to note that she is a very pretty girl (i m saying it quite objectively - it was the reason why i noticed her in the first place), blonde, petite, smart and so on and so forth. So, it is quite obvious that she is getting enough male attention

Right now, she is gone to Mexico for half a year to do an internship, and i m in a university in europe.

Here comes a problem - I have never been a jealous person (i ve been with quite some girls before, but noone ever mattered too much for me, that s why - no jealousy). But now, since she is gone (which is about 2 weeks), I cant stop thinking that something might happen, ie a handsome samba dancer will seduce her or she ll hook up with some guy in a club, or some late 20s coworker of hers will make her head over heals. Rationally, there are no reasons to be jealous, as we talked about this topic quite a few times (at the same time, i know that things happen, people get lonely and or alcohol loosens the self-control), but i still cant stop thinking about it.

So, my question is - how to be able to control my jealousy drive better, coz it definitely would not do any good to either of us.

tl;dr gf is gone for half a year, i m feeling jealous - how to chill the fuck down?"

less than a month ago (at the start of June), she went to sacramento for an internship at a senator's office (im currently located near the Berkeley campus). she came back two weeks ago to visit and we had a lot of fun hanging out again over the weekend because we missed each other (once again, thats how i felt at least). but this past week she hasnt been responding to my texts, emails, or phone calls and the last time i talked to her on Wednesday, she said she would be coming back today and we could talk then (she said she didnt want to talk at the time). so of course naturally i would be worried about whats wrong.

i couldnt sleep i couldnt eat and i couldnt even work because i was so worried - she told me that we could talk on the phone on thursday after she got off work becuase i wouldnt let it go. we finally get in contact and i tell her whats wrong - she says she has a lot on her mind and shes been stressed for work and studying for the LSAT which shes planning to take at the end of the year. she tells me shes coming back tomorrow and shes only a 'maybe' for staying at my place, and i know for sure somethings wrong.

i ask her if shes breaking up with me and after a long pause, she says yes. basically the reasons are that she really needs to study hard and not get distracted during her last year in college and she doesnt see us being together after she graduates (im a year behind her). of course this was heartbreaking and its still hurting like ive never felt before

later on that night, i send her some texts but she wont respond to me so i call her and she says shes just been busy thinking or studying. eventually i ask her if theres someone else involved. and after another long pause, she says yes: all she says is that its someone she met at work, and she says its someone she might like.

tl;dr
thats the story - we've been together for the best 6 months of my life and shes breaking up with me to study and to probably be with someone else. what i need help on now is what am i supposed to do? im completely torn apart. every time i see something we used to do (which is a lot because shes changed me a lot) i cant do anything else but think about that and how much im going to miss doing the stuff we did.

please help."

I've been working there 4 months and have come to the realization that I'm just NOT into writing code.  That's not to say that I don't mind doing it because it is challenging, but the passion isn't there so I know that I will never excel at it.  I also have passed L1 of the CFA and am pursing the designation even though I probably won't be able to land a job that satisfies the experience requirement... I find the material interesting enough to put in the extra 20hrs a week for adequate exam prep.

I would say that I'm a fairly well rounded candidate with my finance/accounting knowledge to complement my IT skills.  My internship ends in a year and it's always been a dream to work in the video game industry, but it seems like it's increasingly difficult to break in for someone who isn't specialized and doesn't have exp in the field.  

Any advice? In terms of the actual job, I would be open for just about anything as long as it's challenging, but I think my skillset would suit an analyst role (systems, business or financial).

I currently have a research internship at a university in a place I've never been before. I told myself that I would just make lots of friends in the summer to keep my spirits up.. the problem is that the majority of students here in the summer are guys, and I have been misreading what I had been interpreting as ""friend"" signals (I'm rusty at picking up signals.. its been awhile since I've been single). One in particular seemed to be just super friendly and we clicked and got along together very well. Then one night, he kissed me and told me he'd been crushing on me pretty hard. He is a great guy and I realized I like him too, but I am not sure what to do with this because I don't want him to be a rebound and I also don't think its healthy for me to jump into something again so soon. I haven't told him this though so I guess I've been sending him mixed signals?

Other opportunities have presented themselves to me, but I never know if I should seize them or not. I can and have seized a couple, but I don't ever feel anything out of it (besides mentioned above) so I know its not the answer.

Any advice on what I should be doing to get over my past relationship and gain confidence to get back to my normal self?"
cjwkq,1,2010-06-28,Advice from graduate level engineers,afarzin,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cjwkq/advice_from_graduate_level_engineers/,I'm currently an undergraduate electrical engineer in Canada about to enter my last year. I'm in a co-op program so I've been working  at a couple of good engineering companies for my work terms and I've gotten to know the work and talk to the people. I've realized that I don't really find undergraduate work in general challenging enough. Obviously I was only an intern but I could see these jobs only being interesting for about 5 years before I'm not challenged at all. Even design-based jobs seem to be limited to picking a design from a pre-determined set of choices. Right now I'm thinking about graduate school for either a MSc or a PhD. Has anyone found themselves in a similar situation? Should I just stick with work? Will a masters provide me with more interesting work? What are the prospects for a PhD?

Any stories? I feel like my shitty work situation is affecting other areas of my life, ie, my will to socialize, because of how depressed it's making me and how burnt out I am.

Edit 2: My current place of employment is the first job I ever had - I've been working there in some capacity for ten years now (first 4 were internships) - and when I started I exhibited the first 4 phases of what causes ""burnout"" as per the wiki:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_(psychology) 
I was a young kid out of college, I would come in on the weekends and work all kinds of craziness because I wanted to do a good job and prove myself. Now, the fresh kids we hire don't seem to give a shit and it fills me with such rage because I see them as being ingrates. Mabye I was the sucker for wanting to take my job seriously?

We got into a fight this past Sunday regarding him staying up until 5 in the morning playing video games when we had a prior commitment (a company party) that day. Obviously, getting him up was a bit of a problem, but he claimed that the party was relaxed enough that it didn't matter if we came a little late even though I would have rather car pooled with his family. The thing is, he told me that night he'd only be up only until 3 in the morning playing games, so he could wake up at 11 am, and still get 8 hours of sleep, which he didn't do. We were both upset in the car, and he made my dad come pick me up, so we never ended up going to the party anyway. Admittedly, I didn't handle the situation well because I blew up, but now he ignores my phone calls, e-mails, IMs, what have you. It sucks because we intern at the same company. I don't know what to do... we've had fights before, so I don't see how this one is any different, but I'm really scared it's over even though I still obviously love him. It was just a fight! I even apologized repeatedly.... how long should I let him cool off? Should I even bother anymore?    "

I work for a startup software company where we make enterprise reporting software (yes it is quite boring stuff). We brand our main product as being easy to use, but after a year and a half here I don't think our product is simple to use and that we need to rebrand ourselves in order to convey that we're just as powerful the competition while offering an alternative to the design process.

Since I finally have a chance to have my voice heard, what do you think is the best way to go about doing this without offending anyone in the company? I was thinking about taking key pages on our website and ripping them apart as well as coming up with a new video, flash, or landing page that says what I want to say.

I've started coming in to work pretty late, and nobody has said anything. Am I just being paid to be there doing nothing? I really like the environment and the work I was doing earlier this summer was pretty cool, but now I seriously am boring myself to death at work. 

The product we are working on is scheduled by some corporate overlords elsewhere, and even our manager (on vacation since last wed. to 7/6, plus was gone the whole week before too) doesn't really have much say over what work needs to be done.

ckiuj,0,2010-06-30,THE PROJECT,liveandlearn,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ckiuj/the_project/,"Hello Reddit. I'm pretty new, just signed up last week I think, but I've been lurking for a while. I've read a bunch of the advice threads and I think you guys might be able to help me. 

I just recently got out of a three year relationship, that was the best relationship of my life but had to end for logistical reasons. I learned alot from it and from my ex. I learned that I'm good looking but I absolutely lack confidence. I've been working out for the past year and have amassed a good amount of muscle. Before this relationship I suffered quite a bit with women. I've always been a nice guy, and I ended up in this last relationship because I had grown tired of being taken advantage of. Which brings me to my project for the summer. 

I have taken it upon myself to become a machine of sorts. I want to be able to get any girl I want. Before I get yelled at in the comments, let me make it clear that despite all that I've been through I still respect (and actually love) women. I love being around them. BUT. I'm just coming into my own in the world. And I want to get into and perfect the dating game. So here's the deal. I've been working at an office for an internship program and there's this really hot intern that works on my floor. She's black, and from her accent I think she's into gangsta dudes, and wouldn't at first be attracted to me. I'm a black suburban guy. But I think confidence is key. Sometimes I get a little shaky when I'm around her and do my best to ignore her. I think she caught me looking at her legs one time but that might be a good thing. Yesterday I made her laugh a little bit, and SHE sometimes gets shaky with me when she's in my cubicle. I want to ask her out, and by the end of the summer I want to get her naked. There's going to be an office party in two weeks and I want to have made significant progress by then. Any advice on how to proceed reddit? 

TL;DR: Intimidating but hot black chick, good-looking but nerdy suburban black guy, same office, how to ask out/seal the deal?"

ckncj,4,2010-06-30,What do I do now?,itstartstoday,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ckncj/what_do_i_do_now/,"Hey all, 
This might be a little long, so please bear with me if you can.  
I am 22 years old and I graduated from a UC school in the spring of 2009.  Since then I've applied to the Peace Corps and I'm in month 11 of the application process.  My file has finally been passed to the placement office.  I haven't been able to find a job since I graduated and moved back home to the midwest (really, not even an hourly job in a grocery store), so I've been working an unpaid internship, volunteer tutoring and other volunteer work, and taking a couple classes.  The volunteer work was geared toward making me a better candidate for the Peace Corps.  I've been nominated for a position in Africa teaching biology, as biology was my undergrad major.  

At one point, I was all for any assignment they could give me in the Peace Corps.  After nearly a year of waiting, I'm not sure if I want to go anymore.  Mainly because...I have a boyfriend now.  That I really, really love.  We dated for a year or so in high school and broke it off when I went away to college and he joined the military.  Now that he's back, working and going to school, I just don't really want to leave.  I know he really loves me, but I don't want to ask him to wait two years, and I am afraid if I leave he will find someone else.  Even though the Peace Corps is something I really think I would love doing under the right circumstances, I'm afraid that I'm going to be an ineffective teacher/volunteer, and if I go, I'll be throwing away a chance at being with the person with whom I've decided I truly want to spend my life.

So that is issue number one.  

Number two, if I do get into the Peace Corps (it's still not a sure thing) there are few reasons I feel obligated to go.  First, my parents have paid my way through (very expensive) college and my wasteful post-college year.  I don't want to ask them to wait longer and pay more while I apply to graduate school.  Second, I don't think I can get into a respectable graduate school right now.  I didn't get to know any of my professors, the one professor whose classes I did very well in, I asked for a recommendation for the Peace Corps and I'm not sure if it would be appropriate to ask her again.  I didn't do any research.  I didn't participate in any clubs.  I just went to school, got a 3.55 and graduated.  I already asked my internship supervisor for a recommendation for the Peace Corps, as well, so again, I don't know if it would be appropriate to ask for another.  I've never been employed in a paying position.  I don't really have anyone else to ask.  

I think my dad would be happy if I didn't do the Peace Corps route and I just went to school, but I feel bad just going to any school, as arrogant as that may sound.  I want to go somewhere somewhat respectable and get a good education.  Going into the Peace Corps would give me some credentials and open up some doors for me (I do know that I eventually want to further my education), but I don't know if it's worth it. 

So my questions are: If I get into the Peace Corps, should I go?  Anyone care to share a Peace Corps experience?  If I shouldn't go or if I don't get in, how can I bulk up my resume and find some recommendation writers for graduate school?  And finally, can anyone recommend schools with graduate programs in biology?  I have some in mind, but first-hand knowledge is always better.

*TL;DR* I don't know if I want to go into the Peace Corps because I have a boyfriend that I don't want to leave behind.  If I decide not to go or if I just don't get in, I don't know if I can get into a good graduate school and I need some advice to help me improve my chances of being accepted.  

Thanks for reading everyone, and any advice, good or bad, will probably help with my anxiety.  I also apologize for worrying about things most people don't have the privilege of worrying about.  I always feel ashamed to complain when I know I have so much, but I really don't know what to do."
