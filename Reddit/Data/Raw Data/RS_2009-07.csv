I go to check my inbox where my dad, a self-professed Disney nut (who has been following the news about the monorail crash), reports to me that the pilot used to work in the Sunset Attractions Area during the summer of 2008. 

This matters, because that summer I too worked the Sunset Attractions area as a sort of intern for Disney in their college program. I clicked on the link he had forwarded in the e-mail, and I saw the pilot's photograph. 

No fucking way. It was Austin. 

I immediately tabbed my browser to check facebook, while firing up pidgin to see if I could contact somebody I used to work with. Sure enough, there was the.. 

""RIP Austin Wuennenberg - Driver in WDW Monorail Crash 07/05/2009""

..group on facebook. And already, Austin's facebook page had become a tombstone; The kind of digital graveyard phenomenon I had only read about in Wired, but never witnessed firsthand. Friends, family, peers, his girlfriend, telling stories about his life, sharing memories, crying out in anger, all in the sort of morbid lingo you hear at funerals, made all the more stoic and absolute in typeface.

""He will be missed""  

I wrote my piece on his wall, is this modern grieving? Why do I feel I need to tell all of reddit? Maybe just to highlight the human element behind just another news story that made the front page of reddit, because until today that's all it was for me.

But damn, what a way to go. However, Austin was known for his dark sense of humor, I would appreciate, and I know he would have, any good joke relating to being killed by a monorail. There has got to be half a year's worth of material in there. You're either laughing or your crying and besides, you assholes are going to upvote the most in-appropriate one anyway. God* I love reddit.

Since I was in a pretty big group I didn't get to ask very many questions, but here were what I thought were the more interesting parts:

1) He supports jury nullification as a method of protesting unjust laws.
2) He would vote against the Sotomayor nomination if he were in the Senate.
3) It is ""unlikely"" that he will run in 2012 as a Republican, even less likely as a third party candidate.
4) The CIA is likely involved in instigating opposition within Iran.
5) He makes it through the day and keeps fighting because he knows he has the support of young people helping him. He seemed to love meeting with us and spent almost 45 minutes talking with us before we voluntarily left.
6) He thinks that if the federal government went bankrupt, it would be a mixed blessing because we would focus on survival rather than expanding our empire.
7) I suggested that the |,,L sign was for UT or love but he said he thinks it’s his arthritis. 

I also thanked him for his integrity and conviction and told him he has supporters around the world, per your request in my previous post. EDIT: I didn't ask him for permission to release the audio, so I only plan to use it to clarify the above points or maybe quote or transcribe some of it."

91gbo,7,2009-07-15,AskReddit: Is it morally wrong of me to draw out my project at work so that I keep getting paid? [See details],j-mar,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/91gbo/askreddit_is_it_morally_wrong_of_me_to_draw_out/,"Me: College student.  Starting my third year as a CS major.  I like my gadgets and I like having nice toys (read: iPhone, car, computer), not to mention I like going out and having a good time with my girlfriend.  In the fall my mom and her fiancé are moving 12 hours away from me, thus leaving me completely independent; tuition, food, housing, gas is all up to me.

Employer:  High roller life insurance company.

Job Details:  I was hired as a summer intern to create them a user's manual for one of their systems.  They have 3 systems in which they enter all their clients and where they do all sorts of insurance related transactions.  They were audited and told that they needed to have documentation on how to use their newest system, which everyone’s been using for a few years now.  As such, all of the employees here know how to use the system and the manual is really just to meet some requirements, it's not all that needed.  Their system is pretty intuitive ... for the most part.

This job pays really well for someone my age/education level.  I don't clock in or out.  I come in around 8 and then leave at 4:30 like they told me.  I had various car issues over the last few weeks in which I couldn't get to work.  I emailed a semi-manager to tell her I wouldn't be in.  *I still ended up getting paid for the 2 and a half days I missed.*  They aren't really organized in this department of the company, and they really don't care too much about me and my task, which is fine.  By no means am I trying to ""teach them a lesson.""  However, I just had a meeting, like I do every other week, where they ask me about my progress.  I was asked if I'd ""get it done by the time \[I\] go back to school.""  I could easily be done by next Friday, but after that the paychecks will stop and I'm sure I won't be able to find another job for the rest of the summer.

I recognize that I’m very, *very* fortunate to have this job.  At the end of it all I **will** be handing them an excellent product, in my opinion.  I have spent a ton of hours working on it so far and I’m quite proud of what I’ve accomplished.  There have been a few days where I have come in and been waiting on a meeting or something and had them push off the meeting in which case I’ll just browse reddit for literally 8.5 hours.  I’m fine with that.  There have been *days* in a row where I’ve done that.  I have no problem coming in every day to do this for the money I’m getting paid.  By delaying this project, I don’t feel that anyone will be harmed or influenced at all.  They really have no bearing on how big or small the task is.  They aren’t rushing me and they told me I’m doing fine and that I just need to give them a week or so heads up before it’s done so we can review it.

As far as the money goes, I mentioned a few frivolous reasons why I need the money.  However, I should note that most of my money has been saved.  I have treated myself nicely thus far, but I know that I’ll need the money in the future for school.  Pretty much from here out, 75-85% of my pay will go directly into my savings account not to be touched (that’s spending money on food and gas).

So I’m asking, is it morally wrong of me to draw out my project so that I keep getting paid?

tl;dr – I work for a big company that needs a small task completed.  It’s not urgent, they just need to meet an audit requirement.  I like coming to work, I like getting paid, I can very much use the money.

I’d be happy to answer any further questions.

I think Redditjobs is a great idea, especially in these times. I keep hungrily returning to it, only to see the same stale postings from a month ago. There are currently 19 jobs posted (most of which are probably taken by now), and 500,000+ people are losing their jobs every month. Do we see the disparity?

I know there are jobs out there -- especially, and luckily, for people of the computer-savvy mindset. It would be much appreciated if Reddit could maybe set a hapless intern or two in pursuit of finding more companies that want to be considered by Reddit's considerable talent pool.

Not to mention I love programming while high.

If I were to be in CA longer I'd get a medical card.  I've managed to get small amounts from street dealers a couple of times, but I just hate dealing with the shady people around here.  You can only stretch a dime so far.

Today I was on the prowl for some, and as I was turning the corner onto a fairly prime area, I saw five police cars drive up, and pull their guns on two black dudes.  They proceed to shove them to the ground, cuff, and frisk them.  Fucking racists.  I don't know the full context, but I'm sure it was drug (and probably weed) related, and that firearms and general roughness certainly wasn't necessary.

Anyway, this scared the shit out of me.  I'm not going to try to get any in any kind of public setting again, at least until I'm back where I'm from.  For the police there it's essentially decriminalized.

What's a good, safe, unsketchy way of obtaining some?  The friends that I have made here so far are pretty unchill regarding this topic, categorizing weed smokers as ""druggies""."

We had been long distance for the past two years, and not-so-coincidentally have broken up twice in the past two years.  We were both finishing up our junior years in college and were planning on living together this summer to the West Coast (we're from the East Coast).  We decided this back sometime in February; I had been looking for internships for months with no success.  My dad offered to hand in my resume to his company in the Midwest and I figured it couldn't hurt.  The boy finds an internship with great ease (naturally) and immediately takes it.

See, last summer, he got an internship in the DC area and I, who wasn't thinking about the post-college world yet, didn't have any better prospects than a cashier job, so I went down with him, which caused huge fights between me and my parents, including threats of withholding payment for school and estrangement.  I did end up getting a job down in DC, and at the time I believed my parents to be strongly overreacting, but I wasn't in a good spot financially and hated fighting with them constantly, so naturally, it wasn't exactly something I didn't want to repeat again.

Come April, I still didn't have anything in LA (where the boy got his internship) and I was getting nervous.  Come May, I didn't have anything in LA, but an interview with my dad's company, and, being a jobless worried person, I took the interview and got the job.  So my parents are like 'You should take it!' and my boyfriend is like 'You promised you would come out with me to California!' because, in his words, California was going to be the best and greatest thing for our relationship and was going to fix everything and put us on the right track, etc.  So naturally a lot of fighting occurs - I want a job, but I also desperately want to be in California, for it had been a personal dream of mine and I was just getting out of a pretty deep depression and thought that if I could live a dream of mine, if I could achieve a goal that I set for myself, it would be a sign that I had control over my life and that I could do what I wanted to do, etc.  So, long story short, my parents yell at me and make me feel worthless and I make my mother cry and she says that my father won't speak to me if I go gallavanting off again, while me and the boy are driving to California, and I tell the boy that I have to go to the Midwest and he drops me off at the airport in Denver and drives off.  And he's *angry.*  And, given the way he had been talking about this trip, and given how angry he was when he just decided to leave me at the airport (about 15 minutes passed inbetween me talking to my crying mother and me being left alone at the airport), I figure that our relationship is over and I'm bawling in the airport, my parents pay for a flight home, etc.

OK.  So fast forward a few months.  I dig myself out of yet another depressive state that I immediately spiraled into from the moment I step into the Denver airport and I have a quarter-life crisis, of sorts.  I believe I have to sort things out and figure out issues between me and my parents and stabilize my own personal and emotional state and really figure out who I am after all of this and all of that.  And the whole time, the boy keeps on calling me and calling me and calling me, saying that he doesn't understand what he did wrong and how could I ever feel abandoned in Denver and how could I ever think that me not going to California = me leaving him and why I don't deal with how 'emotionally abusive' my parents are and so on and so forth.  I've told him that this whole thing has been really hurtful and that I'm very confused and need time to figure things out, but the most I got was three or four days without contact.  I just really need some space, and he doesn't understand it.  He doesn't understand that at this point, I really just want to be alone and by myself so that I can sort my life out and get back on track.  At this point, I'm not getting back with him.  You reach a breaking point, you know?  And he says I'm taking my anger out on the wrong person and everything, but I really just want to be alone.  It's not like I don't care about him and it's not like I don't love him, but I really just need to be alone, sans contact, and it is so hard to do.  How do I go about this without hurting him (as though such a thing were possible)?

**tl;dr** (and you don't have to tell me twice about the tl part, sorry...): I have a lot of personal issues involving my psychological well-being and emotional relationships and want to be alone for them but the boy won't leave me be.  How can I convey any clearer that he needs to let it be?"
93jak,210,2009-07-22,My whopping FREE emergency room visit in a land of socialized medicine,carlgorn,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/93jak/my_whopping_free_emergency_room_visit_in_a_land/,"It seems to be ""oh the horrors of socialized medicine!"" story time!

Yeah, so last spring I was studying abroad in Ecuador and I was interning at an orchid reserve in a cloud forest by Quito. I was doing what foreign interns love to pay money to do; manual slave labor. So I was lifting some rocks and I felt a sharp pain on my finger which I thought was the rock poking me. Then I screamed ""Holy fuck shit cock damn oh my god fuck shit!"" and I ran to the nearest stream and threw my hand into the cool water hoping this would somehow ease the pain. My finger then started to turn red and swell and it doubled in width. I felt a little uneasy about the pain and swelling and gripping my hand I stumbled around a bit and sat down wondering if this was serious. I knew it wasn't a snake, since the only poisonous snake there is freaking huge. I thought it must have a been a spider or scorpion, which is still pretty bad. After minutes of contemplating my situation, my arm sunk into numbness and I started to feel a bit dizzy, probably from my anxiety attack.

I then realized this is potentially bad and I needed to get my ass out of the forest and to a hospital. I left the garden and went across the street to the reserve's restaurant, where I explained my situation in terrible spanish to the old crazy reserve owner, who told me it was probably a crab. I thought ""ummm, I think I'm going to go ask someone else now....."" Thankfully, some couple at the restaurant overheard me and offered to drive me to the nearest town's hospital about 10 minutes away. So they drove me to the small town of Nanegalito, which was the area's only hospital.

We then went into the emergency room where I waited about 1 minute to receive help. They promptly took some of my blood and shot me full of painkillers (Sweet!) and did some sort of test thing to it to determine if I needed an anti-venom. While waiting, they asked me questions about who I was and where I was from and why I was in Ecuador they didn't seem to care that I didn't have proof of any of what I was saying. After 10 minutes, they told me to come in 6 hours to make sure that the venom in me is not serious enough to warrant me to carry around a baggie full of anti venom. I came back 6 hours later, and everything was A-OK!

I'll admit, I was kind of afraid to go to hospital in the middle of nowhere in a developing country. But all the doctors seem well trained and had new needles and gloves and plenty of medical supplies and training. They also must have known of all the local poisonous animals since they told me it was a scorpion based on the symptoms and the blood testing thing.

How much did this all cost me? Nothing! Not once did they ask for money and they did not even care that I was foreigner! Their main concern was to make sure that I was not in any danger of harm and to make me comfortable and feel better. Oh socialism, so evil.

But no! The insurance companies here would have us all believe that because I was in a third world country with socialized medicine, I would surely not have received medical attention and would have died if the poison was lethal!
