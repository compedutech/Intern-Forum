I had been talking with someone in the company who really wanted to hire me and earlier this week the HR department finally sent out an offer letter with an offer contingencies document about how I have to ""assist with arranging a date for the pre-employment drug screen.""  Because I was under the assumption that I would get tested immediately once I received and accepted the offer I stopped smoking back in early July.  So I was happy to hear about the offer since now I could get the drug test out of the way and celebrate accordingly.  However, when I inquired as to what I had to do to set up the drug screen the HR lady responded with:

""When we get closer to your start date, I will be in touch with you to verify your mailing address so I can send you an off-site drug screen packet to get this taken care of close to where you are located.""

Sorry if that was a little long, but I would appreciate anyone's input as to whether or not they think I could possibly smoke for a while then hold off for a while before my start date?  What do people think she means by ""closer to your start date""?  Does anyone know anything about the drug screen packet, say perhaps the time frame on setting up the test?  Or just anything you think might be helpful from personal experiences.

so i had already told my parents i smoke weed. they were upset about it and it was an issue for a few weeks but i guess they pretty much let it go

i graduated from college already but i still live at home and im currently unemployed. i am doing an internship tho and the past week ive been getting and submitting some applications. my parents are pretty lenient for being hispanic parents and for me being a girl, but there are basic house rules. my mom and i just always clash tho. im super liberal and she's very conservative. she rarely drinks, if she does she never exceeds 2 drinks. this lady doesnt even drink caffeinated coffee in the mornings. super straight edge.

today my friend came over n we were smoking a j in my backyard when my mom gets home like 4 hours early from work. he was about to leave for class and i was gonna go pick up some more applications :( :( but still. we were totally busted. i tossed it but it reeked. she was sooo upset!! she started going off about how she was so disappointed and how she thought i had quit smoking. she said i was a lost cause and that i should be focusing my energy on getting my life together. she said it was a gateway drug and i was gonna end up on all sorts of rubbish and my brain was gonna be fried. she asked me if i educated myself just to get high. *sigh* it was the worst guilt trip of my life. 
theeenn she said that she had a lot of pent up anger and frustrations and she dealt with them soberly because inebriation was not the way to do it. she said she gave me everything, and what i could possibly be upset about to need to drown myself in drugs. she also asked how i would like it if SHE dealt with her issues by getting drugged up
--this was annoying!! i felt like shit. i knew i had disprespected her house by smoking there...but really..she's super unhappy and frustrated alllll the time. and yeah, i think she could use a few hits every once in a while. but of course i didnt say that. i just shook my head and said that would be terrible.   
she also said she didnt want me to stop smoking because of her, that i should do it for me....but like...i would be doing it for her. i like smoking. and while i admit, even i think i smoke a little too much, i dont want to quit. i tried being more straight edge and went a week or two drinking less and smoking less and i was positively miserable! i dont want to say im dependent...but they help. and eff alcohol. i would rather stop drinking than smoking. the biggest issue is its legality. i can stop smoking. but it would be for her...and to find a job even if it piss tests.

worst thing is ive been saying im gonna cut back for a while. i need to be clean to get a job and ive had some weird not-so-pleasant highs lately. a few weeks ago i even had a mini-panic attack. ive been wanting to take a tolerance break...but quitting! i dont want to!!! guess its time to grow up tho :( at least until i get my crap together, get a decent job, and move out of my parents' house. 




tltr; got busted by my super straight-edge mom. i know i messed up cuz i was smoking at home, so it was super disrespectful. i told her id quit...but id be quitting for her. i &lt;3 smoking. :( guess i need to call it a tolerance break until i move outa here.

What can I do to make my resume more stable?",bluesunshine,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dlhmd/ive_been_laid_off_4_times_in_the_last_5_years_and/,"I started working in IT in 2005 while I was still in college as an intern.  I didn't get the job when the internship was over and I moved on to a large company as a contractor.  After a year (and many attempts to sign on to be a full time employee) I was laid off.  I then went back to the place I interned at (I had a good relationship with the company) for a temporary position until I got a new job.

I got a job at a small company and the job was hell.  After six months I was micromanaged to the point of a nervous breakdown and left the company (the first time I've ever quit a job, ever).  During that time the economy tanked and the only choice I had was to take a temp job at a software company (which was an awesome place to work), and after more attempts to become a full time employee I was part of a mass layoff.  

Now I've been working at a large healthcare company as a contractor for a year and I have no room to grow.  I'm the lowest paid (mostly because I'm the youngest) on my team, I get less PTO then I did working at a grocery store in high school, I've been denied for raises, healthcare is abysmal (ironic isn't it?), and they don't want to promote me because they love my rock bottom salary.

Now that I'm looking for a new, full time job, it seems that HR departments are pegging me as a ""job hopper"".  I've had 2 phone interviews in the last week and they've told me that, ""Well it looks a little strange that you've only been with each company about a year or so"".  Most don't seem to understand that you have to pay dues when you're out of college, how much the economy has changed the job market, and how cut throat companies are when dealing with IT employees.   

So my question is, how should I spruce up my resume to make it look like I'm stable? Also, should I just tell HR flat out that I'm part of a rough market? I was thinking of putting ""temporary"" or ""contract"" next to my positions but I'm not sure how good that will look.  Here's a copy of my resume (I removed all the personal info for privacy and some of the formatting got jacked up, but all the info is there):

dls26,5,2010-10-01,Suggestions for finding and affording an internship?,IntershipsSuck,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dls26/suggestions_for_finding_and_affording_an/,"Hey Reddit - long time lurker first time poster.

So basically I want to know if anyone has any ideas about actually finding and affording internships. To graduate from my school every student in the college has to have at least one summer long internship. The problem is that to get credit for the internship you also have to pay something like $750 for the credit. 

The other problem is most companies that recruit from my school or want my skill set are located in DC or other really expensive areas. I would have to buy a car, pay for local housing, pay for food and all that on top of paying my rent over the summer at school (it's impossible to find subletters in the summer - there's too many places open and my house is a crap-shack). The internships do pay but it wouldn't cover the cost of living and keeping my place here and I'd also be loosing out on saving money over the summer through working a local job.

I'd get an internship at my school but they don't pay, are hard to get, and all my peers would have internships at big companies - Booz Allen, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, CIA and it puts me at a huge hiring disadvantage. 


Basically, I'm paying for school myself and a summer internship would cost me more money and I wouldn't be able to pay for school myself. Anyone have any ideas? It sucks being at a disadvantage to everyone else who seems to have school paid for them or in's at awesome companies. 

TL;DR: Need internship to graduate, can't afford one - suggestions?"

dmejh,0,2010-10-03,Laptop stolen - Advice on replacement,capitalh,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dmejh/laptop_stolen_advice_on_replacement/,"Greetings,

Long time lurker, first time topic poster.  I was recently visiting the National Aquarium in Baltimore when my car was broken into and my Dell XPS was stolen (among other important things) from the vehicle's trunk.

As a result, I find myself far too analog in this digital world and hope that the fine fellows of reddit can lend some advice in rectifying this.  I am looking for a performance laptop with a good size screen, but can still be considered portable (15"" sounds about right to me).  I do not consider myself a gamer but I do like higher-end graphics and pretty displays.  I probably prefer Windows 7 on the laptop, but I do plan to have it dual boot with Ubuntu.  I have (or... had) a substantial library of music and videos, so the more storage the merrier.  The laptop is used both for these ""recreational"" purposes and as a primary work laptop- I am a researcher/EE phd candidate, so I have (once again... had) a few math programs I'd run such as Mathematica as well as engineering mainstays such as MATLAB.  I have a tendency to multitask like a maniac (Are they known for their multitasking abilities? Perhaps this was a poor simile) so a processor that can handle running a MATLAB code while I review research papers (read: browse reddit) would be fantastic.  I am including my old Dell specs below for reference.  

I figure Reddit knows this stuff as well as anyone, which is why I came to ask the community here first.  I really appreciate any advice you guys have to help me out! This situation SUCKS  

My old lappy specs follow:
15"" XPS purchased late 2008 with Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T8100 (2.1GHz/800Mhz FSB, 3MB Cache)
4GB Shared Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz (2 Dimms)
High Resolution, glossy widescreen 15.4 inch LED LCD (1440x900) &amp; 2.0 MP webcam (barely used the cam)
128MB NVIDIA® GeForce® 8400M GS
320GB 5400rpm SATA Hard Drive
OS: Vista
Stock DVD/RW drive
6 cell battery

P.S. Is it weird that the first thing I thought upon realizing my laptop, my internship laptop, my ONLY data backup, and my TI-89 from high school were stolen was that my personalized conky file is gone forever?  Don't worry, my attention then turned to the horror of the situation... but conky first.

Last December (Dec. '09), I graduated with a degree in Mathematics, but I was basically an actuarial science major. I would have been an actuarial science major, but I had a poor GPA throughout college, and those three numbers still haunt me today.

Besides my poor GPA, I have no internships under my belt nor do I have any programming skills. If you were to look at my resume, all you would see is a poor GPA at a great university, a layman work history, and minimum computer skills (relative to the actuarial profession).

Since graduation, I've worked hard to pass actuarial exams. I had passed P while in college. Last May I passed FM, and this November I will be taking MFE.

I, myself, know that I am hard-working and that I would succeed given the chance, but that's the catch: given my resume, how do I get my foot in the door?

Spoken by the late Roger Nickles (my grandfather), this idea has been engrained in my mind for the past 21 years of my life. Just think about it for a second… if we are all thinking the same way (doing the same things, following the same trends, committing the same actions, etc.) then no one is really thinking at all. How can people go their whole lives living exactly like everyone else? Wearing the same trends, shopping at the most popular stores, buying what everyone else has, striving to be like “the Jones’”, speaking the way everyone else speaks, traveling to places because they are the “it” spots, teasing people and making fun of them because everyone else does it, etc. How will our country succeed if no one thinks for themselves? Will we always just follow whatever our friends, family members, teachers, co-workers, politicians, etc. tell us to do?

I currently attend Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa majoring in History and minoring in Sociology. When I was younger my family moved around a lot which meant that we became each other’s friends. My brother and I are still close today, even though he is 25 and lives three hours away with his wife, while I also talk to my parents all the time. Through the years of us moving it was always interesting for me to experience all different kinds of people and a new way of life. I always made good friends wherever I moved and I still keep in touch with some of them today. It has also made me a stronger and more independent young woman and helped me cope with the numerous types of people I met while in college. I spent the first three years of college living in the dorms, and that opened my eyes to the lives of young people my age. I grew up in a very family oriented atmosphere where respect was the key to our everyday lives, and I was absolutely appalled by the amount of disrespect from the people around me. This ranged from swearing to drinking to drugs to vandalism to just plain outright disrespect and lack of common courtesy. Now, trust me, I am not naïve to the world around me. Just because I grew up in a well-mannered, respectful, and family oriented atmosphere does not mean that my family did not make sure I knew what the world was like around me. I knew what I was getting into when I came to college, but it still bothered me a lot when I went to school and saw so much disrespect.

I am now in my 4th and final year at school. I have a great group of friends, a demanding yet rewarding internship, and a new outlook on life and my future. I feel like it is finally time to take a stand on what is going on in this country. Our young people are out of control with their amount of disrespect and I want to show them that just because you are young does not make it right. I am 21 and have never used a swear word or an illegal drug and never even tasted a drop of alcohol until weeks after my 21st birthday. Most people are probably reading this and thinking “this girl is crazy”, but I want to show young people that you do not have to drink, do drugs, use profanity, or be disrespectful to go places in this world. I hope that all of you can read this and find encouragement that a young person is standing up and saying something. I am taking a stand and fighting back against the disrespect and lack of manners in this country, and I hope that all of you out there that agree with me will also stand up and not accept what has happened to the world around us.

TL DR: Trying to get the youth of our country to think more about the way they treat others. Please let me know your opinions.

We were fellow interns at a company and got to see a lot of each other. We got to be really close. Then summer ended and we had to go our separate ways. And by separate ways, I mean opposite sides of the country. He is finishing up his senior year, and I just started a PhD program.

We continued to talk over Skype, then one day, about a month into the school year, he told me that he still has feelings for me (I did too) and that he didn't want to lose me. He asked me if I would be willing to do a long distance relationship with him.

I agreed, on the condition that he would at least try to find a job (since he would be graduating in May) near where I go to school now, at least within driving distance. I told him that I would do a 1-year long-distance relationship, but not a 5-year one (length of time to get my PhD). He agreed to the terms, and we officially became gf+bf.

This week was the job fair at his school. The results were not good, it looks like he will only be receiving offers from companies near where he goes to school now. Further, I have tried offering suggestions to help him find a job near me: a couple of connections I have with companies down here, flying down to attend a job fair at a school around here, etc. He has shot all of my suggestions and ideas down.

So today, going back to my terms at the start of the relationship, I told him that I no longer want to date him, because I see no future to the relationship. He disagrees and wants to keep it up, because we can still see each other at Christmas (our families live close), and possibly spring break. Am I being unreasonable for wanting to end this? I still really, really like the guy, but I don't feel like he is placing our relationship at a very high priority level.

tl;dr Is it worth staying in a long-distance relationship that may not become short-distance for another five years?"

I figured I'd come to Reddit first before Job Zone or whatever weird thing they're using now, because I'm more likely to find the kind of people we're looking for here.

So, we're looking for someone studying computer science or software engineering, but math works too if you have good programming skills.  We develop primarily in C++, but I personally do a lot of Python as well (though it's unlikely you'll get to see a lot of Python. Maybe some?).


We do R&amp;D in artificial intelligence/optimization - mostly route planning and decision making tools - a lot of traveling-salesman type problems. You should know some AI, definitely some graph theory, have a good working knowledge of ""big o"" notation, those sorts of things.

You should also have really strong communication skills. Our interns have had a good share of independence (that is: I won't be micromanaging you, though I'm always super happy to help tackle a hard problem), so it'll be crucial that you can explain to me what you've done with the problem we've given you.  I really look for this and I know my manager does too.


A few examples of the kinds of things we do:

* We're going out to Oregon to fly a [ScanEagle UAV](http://i.imgur.com/cs9hs.jpg) with some of the routing software we've written for it
* We're developing some ship routing software for large cargo ships, and we've had to ride the ships with our software while we tested it
* I worked on a smartphone app to help emergency responders deal with large scale disaster scenarios ([I got to ride around on a police boat](http://i.imgur.com/MX2pD.jpg) while we tested it in a mock scenario)


Boeing is an extremely cool company - we do so many more things than just commercial airplanes (in fact, I've never had anything to do with our commercial airplanes... go figure). 
Our internships are excellent - they pay competitively, and they typically pay to help you relocate.

My group is great and I really love what I do - I'm legitimately excited to go to work on most days.

Also, summer in Seattle is the best. It's sunny and 75 degrees every day. I love it here.

So, if you're interested (or know someone who is)... here's the **[job requisition](https://jobs.boeing.com/JobSeeker/JobView?reqcode=10-1016435)**. Ignore the position description because it's just a generic one they make for us. 

**If you're going to apply**, you should PM me your name first so that I can watch for your resume when it comes. If you're uncomfortable giving out your name over Reddit, just create an alt or ask me for my Boeing email address and you can send it there.

If anyone has any questions (about me, the job, Seattle, anything at all), just leave them in the comments or PM me and we can talk more.

Thanks Reddit!


**Edit:** I forgot, one of the cool things I should mention is that I'm actually starting work on my first patent application this month. Boeing definitely encourages that kind of thing (and pays a bonus for it, too :-D )"

I will be finished with my necessary courses in March and am hoping to find an internship for the summer. On Friday there is an all accounting job fair at my school and I'll be attending to meet professionals from various firms (including big 4) and corporations.

Here's the thing: other than putting on my fancy clothes and printing out lots of copies of my resume (which I'm hoping to have reviewed by the career center tomorrow), what do I do? A friend suggested I have a few questions to ask each person I speak with. I think this is a great idea, but I just don't know what to ask. What can I ask them about their firm/corporation that will make me seem desirable/knowledgeable? I am still up in the air about what type of accounting I want to go into. The only thing I know is it won't be tax and I'm going to take the CPA exam.

ANY ideas would be helpful. Thanks!

UPDATE: Thank you. I went. I was nervous but I found many things I was interested in. And found I definitely want to be in auditing. The idea is to meet these recruiters then sign up for on campus interviews... well I can't. Because my gpa is too low. Sucks. My own fault for not being a good student, but still frustrating. So we'll see where I go from here."

If you're on your way out the door, or to bed, or have some fun activity planned, this thread isn't urgent. I'm not feeling particularly suicidal right now, so please feel free to move on (even to other threads).

I've been feeling, I guess, really apathetic. I've had long periods of complete emotional coldness toward even simple joys on and off for a long time, but this last year I've been really focusing on working with a positive, happy, can-do attitude. It was really self-perpetuating at first - I got my undergrad degree in June, landed a fairly prestigious job in July, and my employer likes me well enough that they're paying for me to attend a post-grad professional school program starting in January. I love what I'm doing and my employer (a large multinational) is doing amazing things in general for me. I could not have imagined a better way it could have turned out, especially when a lot of people are not so fortunate.

And I am fortunate, really fortunate, which is what makes this all seem so stupid. But as a person, outside of my career, what little I have is falling the fuck apart.

First year doing my undergrad, I lived away in a different part of the country and quickly became immensely popular (I was part of the nerd crew in highschool, so it was quite the change, but I thrived on it). I lost touch with highschool friends because they were doing different things with their lives and I started having difficulty juggling new social obligations as it was. Fourth year, I started becoming really serious with wanting to start a career and with the help of a family friend, got an internship at a small investment bank. My new friends got upset that I didn't have time for them and by the time I graduated, I didn't have any left. I haven't had an irl social interaction since some time (I don't even remember when) in 2009.

I lied, kind of. I do have my family, who I cherish and love with everything I am. Except, they're fighting over pointless bullshit and focused on escalating their fights more and more. I've offered to pay whatever I can to get them proper therapy, but they refuse. I mean, from some people, it's easy to say ""Well, you did your best, it's really up to them,"" but if I lose them, I really have nothing.

As much as I love my career, it's not a life. The only thing I really have is my family, and they're tearing each other apart. I keep playing the inevitable in my head, and I just completely have no interest in continuing. I've tried a range of hobbies (taking up a couple sports, learning about music, reading, writing, going to a bar) and the only thing that's really stuck is reading/writing philosophy. I took about 15 tylenol 1's with codeine, curious to see if it would be cause for an overdose. It just made me stoned for a couple days. The next time, I tried the same thing, but with liquor - same basic effect. Except now I think I'm addicted to the euphoric feeling from the codeine.

Fuck I'm a mess. I just want to chat with people. I don't even care about what. Just if somebody's out there and wants to chat, I'd really appreciate it. I just feel so isolated and pointless.

Thanks."

dp48c,2,2010-10-09,"Reddit, I can't communicate effectively! It's taking a toll on nearly every aspect of my life. ",pdubtehsecond,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dp48c/reddit_i_cant_communicate_effectively_its_taking/,"I've had problems communicating for years. On paper, I can express my thoughts easily and coherently, but orally I'm up the creek without a paddle. 

1. I freeze up when someone asks me a question. It's not as bad as it used to be as I'm actually able to answer the question without stumbling over my words. But I can't give a thoughtful reply. It's more of me speaking as fast as I can to get the damn answer over with. 

2. I'm articulate on paper, and perhaps it's the benefit of time coming into play, but when I speak, I stick to rudimentary words and short sentences. In short, I sound like a middle schooler. Actually... I've met middle school students who speak better than I do. 

3. I tend to get quiet in group settings, and while I know that I'm more comfortable among two or three people, that's not how every social situation is going to be. I want to be able to hold my own in a group, but my problem is that I use laughter as a filler. People don't get to see who I really am, as cheesy as that sounds. And when I do have something to say, it ends up being something incredibly obvious. Like ""oh look it's raining!"" or ""*stubs toe* I JUST STUBBED MY TOE OWWTF"". 

4. Every four or five words is an ""uh/um/er/youknow/pause"" as I think of a word to use. I don't know how people are able to talk so easily on the fly, when I can't even string a sentence off the cuff. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS. And forget about using slang, metaphors or idioms. I can't remember them half the time, it's like my brain hates me. 

I think the root problem is that my brain freezes up. It's not that I don't have anything to say, because I do (chatterbox here), I'm more than often unable to express myself in a manner that is coherent. This communication barrier has reduced my social life to nil, and that isn't an exaggeration. I've had people tell me that they feel like they can't get to know me, and I'm pretty sure that's because I can't express myself properly. It's like my mind goes blank, and not in the occasional staircase wit way. 

I'm applying for internships, but this problem is hindering progress. I smile and nod, or stutter the first few words of a sentence when meeting contacts or networking. Not a good first impression at all. 

I don't know what to do, reddit. ='(

And I read a lot, so the usual suggestions to ""read more"" aren't going to help, I'm afraid.

TL;DR
I don't know how to express myself coherently, so I come across as awkward and over-eager. I soothe myself by stalking reddit all day long. "

I'm having second thoughts...,needadvice88,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dpggy/did_i_make_the_right_choice_im_having_second/,"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice here, not sure if I made a mistake with my girlfriend... Basically, I am 21, and we have been dating for 6 months, about 3 weeks ago we had a talk on if we should end it or not, we gave it a go for another 3 weeks, and a few days ago we ended it...

Here is the back story: I met this girl through a friend who I thought was cute, although very shy, and I decided to ask my friend her story, and she decided to go out with me. Thing about her is that she's never had a boyfriend before, and I was her first everything (except for sex, that was one of the issues..). We dated for 4 months, and the lack of us doing sexual stuff was a problem, but I was on an internship during this time, so focused on that, that the lack of sex didn't bother me, I was willing to wait at that time. I went off for 2 months and we decided to stay together despite me not being happy about the lack of sex.. We talked a decent amount, but while away for 2 months I really started having doubts, about whether or not we were right for each other... See, the thing is she was raised in a very strict home with religious parents, and while she is religious, she doesn't care that I don't believe in God, she is actually a very smart girl who likes to debate about it with me. She also doesn't drink, which I didn't like at all because I like to go out and have fun once and a while, but I learned to accept it over time... What I did really enjoy about her is that she is a genuinely good person, shy but when it was just me and her we could talk for hours, about random stuff, but still be silly as well. I saw a lot of potential in her, but I felt like I just wasn't 100%. The main thing I think was that I wasn't always crazy about her... There were times when I couldn't wait to see her, and there were times where I wasn't very excited at all, and wondered if I would be better with someone else. When I came back from my two month away time, we got back together, and because she saw that I was willing to wait 2 months for her, she opened up a lot sexually, but without actually having sex (oral and anything else was fine).

At one point, I realized that there were some other girls that I met that I was more into, and that raised alarms for me... enough that it freaked me out enough that I wanted talk to her about whether or not we were right for each other. I just felt like I wasn't having enough fun in the relationship, and being only 21, I wasn't sure if I was ready for such a serious commitment when I felt like in my heart, I wasn't sure... See, she is very serious, and if we were going to have sex, she wanted to be sure that the person she is with is as crazy about her as she is about the person (she told me she loved me, and I'm sure if I said it genuinly back, the sex would not be a problem because we would be having it) But she is such a great girl, she is smart, logical, and we have had some great times in the past. I really truly care about her so much, I was willing to wait this long, but now I was just not sure if I was ready for such a commitment, to make her lost her virginity to me when I wasn't 100% about it... For me, this relationship has just grew progressively, and it came down to a point where sex was going to happen or not happen, and I would have liked it to happen, but knowing that sex would have meant a serious long term commitment really just freaked me out.

See, the thing is that its been bothering me a lot - enough that I feel like it has been effecting school and work. But this breakup hasn't made me better at all, if anything I feel a lot worse... Because I do care about her SO much. 

Reddit, do you think I made a mistake? I feel like there might be a lot I'm missing out here because I feel its pretty complicated, but go ahead and ask any questions you feel you need to ask."

From all I've heard and read about the business, it seems like I'm going to have to do months and months of unpaid internships (things like [this](http://www.miloco.co.uk/milocoresource/work_experience.php))... I don't mind making tea, but I can't afford to work unpaid for months and months while paying the rent on my flat, paying for travel etc. etc. Maybe it would be ok if I was still living at home, but for me, It just doesn't work out.

So is this the only way into the industry?

(I've also been working on doing freelance recording for a friend, with some fairly promising results. My kit is pretty basic, but [here's a song](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12698313/She%20Cried%20%28We%20Cried%29.mp3) that I recorded with him here in my flat.

I am getting my undergrad degree in May and will enter Grad school immediately after that. I would like to upgrade my casual wardrobe from cargo shorts and college tshirts to classier and more stylish items. 

I am currently doing an internship and have bought plenty of business casual stuff that fits me very well, including cotton slacks (khaki, brown, orangish, and black), long sleeve button downs (I use these at work, tucked in since most have a flat cut at the bottom), comfortable dress shoes and loafers (black florsheims with my suit and brown/burgundy Johnson and murphys which I use almost everyday), dress belts (thick ones for work, thin one for suit), a new charcoal suit, CK blazer (black), and of course BUSINESS SOCKS.

Areas I need assistance:

JEANS: I have dark old navy jeans that are extra loose because I have big legs/thighs. My waistline is 35.5 inches but I wear 38/32 pants because if not they won't fit my legs. Old navy has stopped producing extra loose jeans and I haven't bought a new pair in like 4 years. Any idea where I can find some?

LIGHT JACKET: I currently own a black nautica light jacket that I use in the fall. I would like to get something a bit nicer and preferably brown. What would be good stores (on line and IRL) to check out?

JEWELRY: I'm not sure if it would look good on me but I'd like to try a simple necklace. I always have something on both wrists (watches, rubber bracelets) and wear my class ring constantly. So I'm not sure if a necklace/what material would be best, if any. Thoughts?

Finally, VESTS: From what I've read, most of you are not fans of vests. I don't own any but honestly, I have never actually shopped for one. I typically dress in earthy/brown tones and was wondering if a nice vest(s) would compliment my style. Where should I go to look for these?

  I'm currently a senior at a liberal arts college; my major is computer science.

I'll try and be as brief and to the point as I can be.

I got into computer science for my love of video games and technology but now realize that a liberal arts college probably wasn't the best place to go because a more specialized school would have given me a much better education (not that the one I'm getting now is bad).

Approaching graduation I'm not sure what to do about grad school because I don't know what I would like to specialize in.

I've had a full-time summer internship as a software engineer since summer of 2008 and got amazing experience there and a taste of the real world. However, I do not believe that is exactly what I would like to do every day in for my career. I was interesting and I learned a ton, but that exact atmosphere might not be my cup of tea.

Many video game design courses I found were part of undergraduate studies (would have been nice 4 years ago &gt;&lt;)...

I want to do something gaming related, so I'd like to maybe shadow people in the New England area who are in the industry or anyone else with a computer sciencey job to hone in on what I would like to do with my life.

I would also love to be something of a gaming journalist for a magazine, but feel like an English major w/ a Communications certificate would have been better suited for that.

Also, I am not so much a lazy person as I am an ""incubator,"" a term I found on reddit that means I procrastinate and think about what I have to do and them pump it out at the last minute with high efficiency. But there is no due date on life!

Any general advice? I have many paths rushing toward me and I'm sort of lost.

First time posting anything like this so any suggestions or questions would also be much appreciated.

Also, Deion Branch is back in New England. Rejoice ^_^

Thanks a lot!

I'm a 21 yr old college student on an internship semester. I bought a plane ticket to visit my girlfriend in San Francisco at the end of the month. Took work off the whole deal. Things just didn't end up working out long distance. I wouldn't mind seeing her but cant spend the whole time with her (I'll save the rest for r/Relationships hahaha). But I am left with this plane ticket and I feel like I'll never get a chance to do something like this again. Here's my Ideas...Either ride around the SF Bay area on my bicycle(I really enjoy biking) and just meet new people see things I've never seen before. Or I was also considering trying to find a farm to work on for my time in the area and trade labor for a place to sleep. Not Sure.

Is this even possible?

I can see this failing miserably and me just ending up cold and alone on a park bench by the Golden Gate Bridge. But I also think it could be a positive life changing experience.

TLDR: Bought plane ticket to San Francisco. I know no one. Will I end up dead if I attempt wander/bicycle the city alone for 5 days?"

First: Should the GUI be separate from the program, or intertwined?  I.E. If an ""open"" button is clicked, should the event handler handle all of the file opening actions, or should it simply send a file path to a different method/class?

Second: How can I review my own code?  I have no idea if I am a good, average, or poor programmer.  Unfortunately my code was never reviewed during school beyond a grade for functionality.  "

Throwaway account here as my other account is my real name. I'm in the first semester of an MS program, in a field that I really enjoy. However, I'm finding that the school I'm at is not the greatest fit for me. I'm toying with the idea of changing back to the school that I did my undergrad work at for several reasons, specifically, the better reputation, proximity to family, friends that currently attend, and my love of the location.

However, I don't know the best route to take to pursue this. The new program would require me to obtain letters of recommendation. I feel like a letter of recommendation from my current advisor, who I also currently do research with, would carry a lot of weight in my application to the new program. However, I'm afraid that I would permanently burn a bridge with this professor if I expressed a desire to potentially leave this program, especially if I am not accepted to the new program.

As it stands right now, I believe that I can count on solid letters of recommendation from a supervisor from an internship, a supervisor from my first real industry experience, and a professor that worked with me during my capstone project as an undergrad. Do you guys think that I would lose out on too much if I proceeded with these guys, and did not broach the topic with my graduate professor unless I've heard positively from the program I'm applying to?

The other issue I see is a potential waste of a semester. Granted, this will not affect me too much in the long run, but it kinda sucks to put in the work only to lose out on the money, time, and studying that I invested. There's a possibility that I may be able to transfer some credit, but I'm not holding my breath.

Finally, does anyone know how university's feel about this kind of situation? I'd imagine that it reflects poorly on me as a student, but I've written a fairly convincing statement of purpose explaining exactly why I feel that this is right move for my situation.

Any advice on the issue is much appreciated.

He was violently abusive to her mother as well as her in the past, but has calmed somewhat within the last couple of years. She spent a year living with her mother in Maryland (we're in Florida), but decided to head back with her dad to finish her last year of high school because a) she wished to be back with her friends here (this was before we met), and b) her dad has money and would pay her way through a college of his choice. Since she's been back with him, he's been emotionally abusive, but she's dealt with it by looking towards the future. Her mom has agreed to help pay for a college of her choice instead, and she's upping the ante in her academics in order to qualify for scholarships. She plans on doing a gap year, then going to a Florida public university near to where I'm currently in college.

However, last night he went a bit further than before and threatened actual violence, though only pushed her down for now. She's now seriously considering it not worth it to stay with him and is thinking of moving back with her mom (something I've been encouraging her to do for a long time now).

However, she's very reluctant to escape, because it means she loses out on many of her plans for after graduation. Losing her Florida residency, she will no longer be able to afford to go to the university she wants to go to, and she will be much further away from me. She also loses all of her social network here. So she's really tempted to ""just deal with it"" and try to survive the next 9 months. I'm really worried about what he could do to her in those 9 months, and so my protective boyfriend instincts want her safely with her mom ASAP. She's worried too, but thinks it may be worth it to stay.

So what should she do? Any advice?

tl;dr: Should my girlfriend living with a dangerous father for 9 more months (until 18) abandon her future plans to spend those 9 months safely with her mom (my advice to her), or ""deal with it"" until she can get out and then be able to stay in Florida and follow her dreams (as she's tempted to try)?

EDIT: Once a legal adult, she is planning on spending the rest of the summer with me (19 and in college) until she starts an internship in the fall. This is the plan regardless of where she lives."

First Time:

Started out my church life as a pretty active member in the youth group, at my peak, I was planning a lot of the youth summer trips and preaching on a very regular basis. When my senior year of high school came around I started having an interest in writing satire, I would post them as Facebook notes and tag some friends, it was all in good fun. 

One particular note upset a couple of people, it was dealing with just life and relationships. I shrugged off a lot of the comments seeing as it was a pretty small minority. However, the wife of the youth minister decided to chime in, unfortunately due my laptop breaking, I do not have the note or the comments at my disposal, I might have them in some e-mail correspondance though. She basically insulted my writing ability, my religious views, and just many personal attacks. We never saw eye-to-eye on a lot of things so, like the other comments, I shrugged it off. However, through a weird chain of events, my parents got word of the particular comment (now they have Facebooks, oh well). After chatting up the Minister of Education, it was found out that every primary staff member had a copy of the note on their desk and was planning to hold a staff meeting over it. Needless to say, my parents weren't happy. The main staff had already decided that it wasn't as bad as the youth minister had made it out to be but the damage was already done.

After a couple of meetings, it was clear that the youth minister did not want anything to do with me, he basically said ""In my mind, you've already left us, I don't even see why we are having this conversation."" They actually thought I was trying to overthrow the youth ministry, I don't know how they came to that conclusion though. By this time, word had spread throughout the entire youth group, of course, a lot of it was just conjecture, people's assumptions ranged from drugs to trying to stir a revolution, either way, they made it clear the last time I went for a service that I should pack my bags and move away.

**tl;dr:** Facebook and subsequent rumors got me forced out of a ministry.

Second Time:

Same church, different story (not as much drama).

Up to this point, the old youth minister had tried to reconcile with me (it was obvious that it was a forced attempt). I accepted his apology and even continued to do some behind the scenes work with the ministry, although I never went there again for my time as an actual youth member. However, once I was ineligible to be in the youth, all contact ceased on his part. Shortly after that he was moved to a different ministry of the church and they promoted one of the associate pastors to be the head of the youth ministry.

After my first year in college, I was given the opportunity to become an unpaid intern (which is an important distinction). My job was to mainly form relationships with middle school boys and possibly form a discipleship group, bible studies, etc. I was also going to help with behind the scenes and sharing the preaching duties. 

For the first two weeks, everything was going great, I was forming some relationships, I had already preached on a Wednesday, in my mind, I had gotten out to a pretty good start. Then the first trip of the summer arrived, basic job was to make sure the kids wake up and go to sleep, other than that, myself and the other adults sat around the housing complex and ate food. This is where I really found my stride with some of the less active kids and being the unattainable twenty year old, I was the crush of many middle school girls. Either way, the trip, in my mind was a success. 

When I arrived back home, I had a plethora of plans to help get this ministry moving. The youth minister arranged a meeting with me, this was normal as we had creative meetings every week. However, it was just me and him this time which was strange, to say the least. He sat me down and basically said that my views do not line up with the views of the children's parents, they assumed Libertarian meant Liberal and that Calvinism was of the devil (even though the preacher was a pretty stout five-point Calvinist). A lot of parents thought that I was instilling my beliefs on to their children, I don't know why I would talk about politics and systematic theology with a 13 year old but whatever. 

I was told that I could no longer help with the ministry, I could continue to come but I was to not lead bible studies, discipleship groups, or anything of that nature. It was implied that I shouldn't really even talk to the children. The main thing that got me was the first incident, even when it's almost two years after the fact, there were still rumors and speculations on what happened. 

**tl;dr:** A false perception of my beliefs combined with my previous incident got my forced out of an internship with the same church.

**Why I'm Doing This**

First off, I'm not looking for any sort of pity or sympathy. I appreciate the sentiment though. It is mainly because I'm bored, honestly. However, most of the people who hear the story (it's become kind of a thing when my friends introduce me to someone ""Hey, meet my friend, he got kicked out of a church!!"") are very interested in it and a lot of them sympathize with me. Needless to say, this has altered my faith dramatically, I'm definitely not the same person I was three years ago.

Questions I won't answer would include the name of the church or the name of the people involved.

EDIT: This was meant to be an AMA, I forgot to put it in the title. I guess it's too late for that.

EDIT 2: Albeit, it was meant to be an AMA, I appreciate all the comments, I honestly didn't think it would get this many. I appreciate everyone's encouragement and advice."
dr8rf,13,2010-10-14,Sleeping Co-Worker,kriboshoe,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dr8rf/sleeping_coworker/,"Alright, so here is the story. I am on my 6th month of an 8 month internship. At the beginning of the 3rd month a second intern started. We both work in our office's library. And he sleeps. Every single day. This in and of itself isn't really a problem. There isn't very much to do, so usually while he's sleeping I'm just browsing reddit, and when there is something to do people tend to ask me rather than him because I've been here longer and I generally work faster. That is also perfectly fine by me. It helps stave off the sole crushing boredom. Alright, so the problem:

A week ago he was napping and my supervisor came in to ask me to do something. He saw that my co-worker was asleep, woke him up, and told him to sign out and go home. This wasn't the first time he had been caught sleeping but it was the first time he had really been reprimanded. After my co-worker left my supervisor came up to me and said that I should try to familiarize myself with my co-workers projects (which happen to not exist). My supervisor told me that he had recommended to my boss that my co-worker be fired and that my boss was going to make a decision and meet with my co-worker the next day.

So the next day my co-worker shows up an hour late and a little drunk. Did I mention he is an idiot? That isn't especially relevant but I felt the need to include it. He came into the library and we talked for a minute or so and he said something along the lines of ""I guess I won't be sleeping at work anymore"" before our boss came in and talked to him. I didn't want to ask what our boss had said, but it was relatively clear that he hadn't been fired.

So he didn't sleep that day, but he came into work and slept the next day and every subsequent day including today. He is currently asleep. I have been periodically waking him up just by kicking the desk or coughing or whatever. Neither of us has really acknowledged this.

Bottom line: I haven't told my co-worker what my supervisor said. I don't know if it was meant to be said in confidence. I can't decide whether I should tell him, just keep waking him up for the next couple months, or just let him sleep and reap the benefits of it. What to you guys think? What would you do in this situation?"

So the story is, we're together for almost 3 years. I'm 24, she's 22. Playing it safe, we decided that she will take the pill. After consulting the doctor, who decided everything was fine, she got her perscription, everything was fine for some time. After about a 1,5yr her sex drive went down, down to 0. We lived with it somewhat for a while, then last summer i got a 1yr internship 2000km from home. So we decide that's it's sensless for her to be on the pill during that time, and that it might help get her ""spunk"" back. 3 months pass, she visits me in my new place, sadly, nothing seems to change back :/

Things go bad between us, not only because of the lack of fun in bed, but because for some time now i feel more like a friend, than a SO. I finally make her realize and admit, that she doesn't feel for me anymore, but she still loves on me on some level and doesn't imagine herself without me. I still love her too, and give her another chance. She promises to change. I have my own theory.

I make her go see the gyno, and my suspitions are confirmed - because of the pill, her body stopped producing Estrogen altogether, and her hormonal balance is way off. Today she got a perscription for hormones(cyclo-progynova), and her first evaluation is in 3 months, but the whole curation may last up to a year. She feels really bad about this, saying ""i don't feel like a woman anymore"". I try to be as supportive as i possibly can from a 2000km distance.

My question is : any female redditors here that had the same/similar experience? How did it turn out for you?

**TL;DR** : my girlfriend took contraceptives, then stopped and her estrogen is gone. she feels like shit."

**TL;DR:** *I'm grossly underpaid. My boss found out I'm looking for a new job, however the client I'm working on will be screwed if I leave (or get fired). I told my boss that I'm looking for a new job because I'm underpaid, now we are allegidly renegotiating my salary.*

I work at a temp agency as a salaried temp worker in the accounting field. My current pay is the lowest I've ever made (lower than my internship pay in college).The company I work for releases a salary guide for for various job positions and my job position salary range is supposed to be $67,000 - $86,000. I'm currently getting paid less than half the upper-end of that range.

The unusual aspect of this situation is that the CFO at the client I've been at for a year just left her job for bigger and better things as of Tuesday. I work directly beneath the CFO so I'm officially running the accounting department now (not much has changed, I do all the work anyway). The CEO is freaked out because I'm the only accountant on their staff (everyone else are clerks) and he's having a hard time finding a replacement who knows health care accounting. The fact that I'm not an employee and could leave tomorrow also keeps him up at night it seems. 

What prompted the meeting today was the fact that my employer found out I have been searching for jobs. They periodically post job listings on Craigslist and DO NOT DISCLOSE THEMSELVES AS HEAD HUNTERS. Which is AGAINST the TOS at Craigslist. So I applied to one of the listings. 

A head hunter from my employer called me 30 minutes later saying I was a great candidate, etc, then she paused and noticed I was working for them already. She then forwarded the info to the office manager and I got a phone call from the manager later on that afternoon. The conversation didn't go to well because she was calling me in the middle of the work day and we we're trying to close the books for the month and didn't want to deal with the situation at that time. 

I called the manager after 5pm multiple times and she ignored my phone calls (as evidenced by having a friend call her number). I caught her by using the clients work line and we had another conversation in which I laid out that I'm looking for a new job because I'm not getting paid what I'm worth. Also they increased my client service range WAY beyond what we initially negotiated when we were negotiating salary, meaning, I have to pay more in gas and wear and tear on my car.

The manager said she'd ""look into' adjusting my salary and we scheduled to have lunch today to discuss things. What should I keep in mind going into the negotiations? I know I have the upper-hand, since the client will be completely screwed if either A) I leave or B) my employer fires me. However I want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything when to comes to salary negotiation etiquette."

However, there's really very, *very* little gradation in the depth of the black ink, I'd love to be able to use the black-channel as a spot-varnish instead of traditional ink.

Normally I'd go about doing this by redoing the illustration as vectors in illustrator and having the Printer swap a color-swatch for the varnish in the eps.

However, these illustrations are incredibly detailed. Obsessively so, and that's really the charm of them... so it would be unfeasible to redo them in illustrator (it would take months with with the pen tool to work this out, and I seriously doubt live-trace can capture the organic details).

And, obviously, I can't tell the Printer to run all black ink as varnish (as there's going to be other items set for printing in black that do need to be black).

Can I just separate the black channel in the scan PSDs and label the new channel in such a way that the printer knows to swap it out as varnish? This seems to be the best guess around the office, but none of us have actually done it this way before...

I'd really rather not ask the printer to do the production work on this file for me. I'd like to know this for the future (not to mention I'd rather not cut into my margins just for him to have an intern do a so-so job for me).

Thanks for the help!"

drsst,8,2010-10-15,"Reddit engineers, how did you get your first job? I've been doing everything I can, and I'm osing hope - thinking about completely giving up on this profession  ",stonefall090909090,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/drsst/reddit_engineers_how_did_you_get_your_first_job/,"
I'm going to be honest here because it is my first post, and I don't want anyone to think this is one of those 'I need a job' threads. I'm not here to find work, I'm just looking for some realistic advice - don't be afraid to pour on the negatives, I am tired of false hope.

Here's my story: I have completed 2 University degrees - Communications and Mechanical Engineering . I am not rich, and I have paid myself through everything in my life. After completing my first degree, I realized that there wasn't much work (reputable, career type work) available. So after working in the communications field a few years (with work that I found almost INSTANTLY without ever really trying), I got tired of the monotony and I decided to go back to school for my engineering degree. I saved up a lot of money and worked most of my way through. The problem now, is that I had to quit my job in my last year to complete my engineering degree on the 4 year pace and I can't seem to interest ANY employers in the field (I have however receieved calls from the non-engineering field recruiters). 

I'm very put off, simply because I was naive in believing everyone I  spoke to saying 'there are millions of jobs out there for engineers, just finish your degree"" etc etc. I took this as fact, and I put all my effort into my studies and not nearly as much as I 'should' have for looking for work/connections during my schooling. 

Now I am fed up. It been over 7 months, and I am getting nowhere. I've signed up for all the job sites, I've attended career fairs, I cold call human resources managers for interest/positions, I have had my resume reviewed by many different people in HR fields and I am free to move anywhere that speaks English in the world. I've applied to many graduate programs/paid internships and I don't get considered because my GPA is not over 3.0 (its 2.9 - which I am very happy with considering I worked almost the entire time I was in the program -even though it is apparently not good enough). The only reason I didn't have a better GPA, is because my University was extremely poorly managed, yet was widely considered the 'best' engineering program for all the Univeristies closeby. Many people would cheat, and the people who didn't saw lower marks (I even tattled on them a few times and the school did nothing). Turns out, after calling a few people, that the school's reputation was awful -notorious for breeding 'idiot engineers' and being one of the 'non-idiots' I can tell you 100% employers are right in not hiring these people. However, how do I convince a hiring manager I am not?  By the time I found out all this, I was in my 4th year and it was too late to transfer universities.

The more time I spend in the job mix, the more I realize i have ZERO qualifications to get hired in this field without significant connections. I have about 10-15 connections in the field and they have been helping by asking around etc, but none are powerful enough to actually hire. I'm sure eventually something will come up, but I am competely sick of waiting. 

I am extremely proud of having 2 degrees, since I really did my best to learn the material and enjoy the subjects, so I do not regret going to school in the slightest. What I do regret, is going into engineering instead of medicine, which I could have gotten into as well. I chose engineering for 2 reasons, because I was interested in it more than medicine, and because I was SURE I would NEVER have to spend extended periods of time looking for work. There is NOTHING I HATE MORE than looking for work when I am a qualified candidate. I feel as though my phone should be ringing off the hook with offers since I am qualified but I went with the all out effort to find work anyway because I wanted a REALLY good job in this field. I have not been slacking - I think I've put in more effort into finding work than I did studying during my program. I would understand if I had no education but I have 11 years of failure free post secondary education and no on employers seem to care. 

Anyway, I'm just wondering how long it took everyone else to find work in engineering, and whether it is really worth it to continue looking? Some of my friends who have engineering experience and many don't even like it that much. I was initially VERY excited when I finished my degree and I was hoping to make a difference. Now, I'm thinking about going back to my old degree's field, and giving up engineering for good. I'll never regret learning the material and going back to school, I'll just regret wasting all this time looking for work in a field that will not hire new members. 

TL; DR - Very tired of looking for work in engineering field. Probably going to throw my degree away and look for a different profession that actually hires new graduates."

However, my life in US has been more fulfilling than I could ever imagine. I have good friends here and the future to look forward to.


Only 2 years ago, I moved to US with one suitcase and almost no money on my bank account. All I had was an acceptance and a partial scholarship for one of the most prestigious art colleges in US.


When I think about it now, the decision to come here was foolish. I knew very well that I couldn't afford to pay for the entire studies and I had no idea how to deal with it. Unlike US citizens, I was not eligible for financial aid and I had no one to help me get a loan. So I just decided to make the first step and hope for the best.


In only few months, I got into financial trouble but fortunately, my mother was able to borrow some money and send it to me. All this time I was looking for job opportunities and I worked on my academic goals very hard. I was motivated like never before, but at the same time I was afraid that I might not make it.


After the first quater, I got a part-time job at the college as a web developer. The job paid enough for housing and food. Then, something amazing happened... I got a paid internship with one of the biggest game development companies in the world! Holy shit... that was more than I believed was possible. My motivation exploded and the shit started to develop exponentially! My student work got published in the geekiest magazine! My scholarship was increased! I got another internship at the biggest computer animation studio in the world and several job offers pending for me after I graduate.


As I said... Im not rich and I probably never will be. I have one suitcase more than I had 2 years ago but my head is filled with amazing experiences that exceeded my dreams. I dont know what my future will be, but I feel it can be anything I imagine and more.

I'm going to be graduating from Penn State in the spring, and I've been looking for jobs after graduation. Pittsburgh is the city I have always wanted to live in (grew up in Central PA, Altoona area). However, there doesn't seem to be many postings on my schools job board for Pittsburgh area.


At a career fair I talked to UPMC, but they won't be looking to hire until 2 months before I graduate which seems a little late to me considering I have gotten a few interviews from other companies. I may just be being impatient because a few of my other friends have already gotten offers.


Anyway, I was just wondering how people see the IT job market in Pittsburgh. To do a quick summary of my skills, I mostly concentrated in development so most of the classes I took were on Software Engineering, mostly in Java. We went through usability, testing, UML, requirements, and of course coding. However, I have also taken classes in Networking and Network Security, and Databases (MySQL). I also have an internship at Penn State providing technical support for the College of Health and Human Development which covers several networks in several buildings across the campus. I have also developed a few web forms and am competent at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Ok, enough with me pitching myself. If anyone has any hints at companies to apply for that would be wonderful. Also, any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!

EDIT: Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for the advice and leads. I got a lot of stuff to look into. If anything comes up I'll be sure to post an update. Thanks again!"

""Hanging out"" usually means grabbing some sugar-laden concoction at Starbucks, going to a club or bar to drink alcohol or soda, or going out to lunch or dinner. Holidays revolve around eating. Rarely do people turn to their coworkers and say ""Let's go ride bikes after work."" 

For example, last summer, when I was dedicated to getting into shape, I saw my relationship with my coworkers dwindle relative to their relationships with one other. They grabbed lunch together everyday at Chipotle, street carts, and other fast food places. 

Occasionally, I'd join them for sushi, but other than that, I would pack my own food. I also kept happy hours to a minimum.  This resulted in me being relatively isolated. Luckily, it was only an internship. In the end, losing the 20 or so pounds was worth it.

Below is my current job/life situation. I have never been this candid with you before. Please be gentle. I could use some encouragement and/or advice. OR A JOB IN NJ! :)

**What I Do:**

I work in Pharma; 3 years now. Started in Facilities and am now part of the Records/Content department. I am part of a team that handles all incoming study documentation for various drugs that are currently being tested.
My main objective is to guide a large team of people located in India in attribute extraction and implementation. I am the main administrator for the online database of this company. I do not know code; I merely manipulate attributes and make sure documents get into the system and are correct. I help beta test software, I make sure our software is working. I hire onsite staff and supervise a small team. 

**I AM OUTSOURCED**
My position is at the pharma company, but the department itself was outsourced. I am salaried and my benefits are a joke. Also, direct management is in India (although, they like to pretend they're in Michigan).

**Wages**


I am underpaid for what I do. I wrote down my salary and showed it to someone doing something similar and they responded, ""wow, you're getting screwed.""

I am the lowest paid despite the fact that I run a team apart from the main group; My main manager from India tried getting me a raise, but HR said ""can't do it, it's not in the budget""
Ex. The girls they just hired are making 30% more than me and they cannot do what I do and I know what they know. 

**My Accomplishments**


First assignment: close doc room downstairs b/c coworker was dragging feet. It took me a month, but I did it despite coworker's slow pace. 
Since then I have been running the teams overseas. I keep them on target and honest.
Just last week I closed a multi-million dollar project out with less than a .001% error rate. I was promised a bonus - no bonus.

**The Lies**


1) I was moved from Facilities as a temp making X. New boss promised X + Y. Never got it. Yes, I went from fixing printers to a totally different high-level position and did not receive a boost. I made less than the summer interns for 8 months. 

2) Outsourcing Management: Was promised raise while i was helping the new manager understand everyone and everything. We'd go out and talk shop. We did this until the outsourcing occurred. No significant raise. 

3) Same manager from 2 would give me all these different projects that were unrelated to my position. I wrote project plans for him, did administrative stuffs, and coached him during telecons. He promised me a management position within a year. Come time for boost and respect, he mysteriously disappears

4) New-new manager promises to fix the wage issue and there's a bonus - he says HR says no

**The People**


Let's face, my group hates me. I get the desk and the special projects. They talk and talk about how shitty I am behind my back and all make more money than me. It's awesome. 

**New Job Hunt**


None of the good agencies will touch  me b/c of where I work. They don't want to hurt their relationship with the company my company contracts to. The job hunt sucks. I have been looking since May. Had a lot of phone interviews, but nothing seems to come of it. 

**Limbo**


I know my clinical stuff, I know my regulatory stuff, but I work as an IT coordinator, attribute quality controller and don't know any code. So the jobs that I see are a mixed bag of shit I can do, but no experience(Clinical Research, Documentation Specialist) and shit (system analyst) I can't do because I only know the one part. 

**Drinking**


Yup, do that

**The Fiance**


Her parents just want me to work. I should have gone to grad school and still can, but now I have a future wife to take care of. I want to just quit, but I cannot. I just want to make her happy, but I'm so unhappy I can't make myself happy. I don't know what to do man. I really don't. EDIT: Provide for her, we already discussed me taking a low wage job until I find something else, but that's a fall back if I completely lose my mind. 

**TL;DR**


I hate my job, but can't find a new one. I need to keep working, but I'm starting to suck at life. I don't know where to start...and I feel like everything is my fault. Any words of encouragement and/or advice?"

my options atm:

1-- so i've got this guy in shanghai, china looking for an internship in architecture for me (yeah random/sketchy, but actually looking pretty legit). i'll have to pay him something like $900 if i choose to go (and his company or whatnot will help me acclimate to the area and a free phone with 100rmb of minutes!). if i go this route, i'm pretty sure i will at most break even in terms of money and most likely go negative (not too big of a deal, i have some money saved so i won't go broke... but close)

2-- my cousin is in the army and going to be stationed in iraq. he tells me there's a demand for some civilians there to do menial computer related tasks for ~80K+ salary. says he's got the hookup and with my degree it should be a pretty sure thing.

thoughts? i'm seriously split on this the two options that i've been contemplating tossing a coin... i actually did and it landed on shanghai, but it wasn't really a coin, it was one of the rubber popper things where you flip it inside out and then put it on the table and watch it jump, so i don't know if that counts.
on one side, i'll have fun in shanghai and iraq will be boring. shanghai might lead to further connections where i can further pursue a career i like (key word might). iraq will give me... money? and that shit is pretty important when you want to do things i hear.

I'm taking a beginners course once a week, and have a dictionary. I listen to conversation all day everyday, but without any educational background or context, my progress is slow going. The other issue: I have 8 weeks left in my internship. How can I speed up my learning process? Quick solutions needed, but any advice is helpful/appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: I realize that learning a language takes time, but I just need to know enough to get by with my research! I'm feeling a lot of pressure and it's getting to be that I'm avoiding/neglecting my work because of it.

Update: Thanks for all of your input, guys, I really appreciate it. I'm reviewing what I can everyday, and starting to speak more with my colleagues. I still feel inadequate, but I'm starting to feel like I might get there eventually. :)"

I plan to travel to Australia for 4 months with my girl friend who will being studying abroad at the University of Queensland. I will not be studying. I plan on taking time to explore a new country, make new friends, and basically go on an adventure. I plan on finding a short term job while I am in Brisbane to supplement my travel funds as well. I applied for a work holiday visa subclass 462 online and I'm assuming I'll be approved in a few weeks.


Let me just give you some background information about me. I am a student at Rutgers New Brunswick in New Jersey. I will be graduating at the end of this semester with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Exercise Science and Minoring in Music. I have internship experience at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in Cardiac Rehab. I have 5 years experience as a waiter. I am a 22 year old white male. I am a skilled guitar player. I have numerous skills and talents, yet my girl friend is afraid that I will not be able to find a job in Brisbane when we go. I'm honestly not trying to find a serious job. It be nice to get a personal training job, but I'm willing to work any job I don't really care; serve tables, bar tend, bus tables, wash dishes, make sandwiches, cashier, wash cars etc...

I feel that I should be fine, but assurance is always nice. If anyone has any tips that could possibly help me find work in Australia I would greatly appreciate your time."

I live in Baltimore, MD and I feel that I've exhausted the obvious avenues, sending my resume and cover letter to every magazine, newspaper, publishing house, etc., that I can locate. 

I am not opposed to internships, of course, but as I am not a college student, I tend to be excluded from consideration. Additionally, I have to support myself and so work-for-pay, in an obvious sense, takes priority.

I realize that there are only 10 readers in this subreddit, so this really is a shot in the dark, but I could use some advice from persons familiar with the industry.

dtu6u,27,2010-10-20,My first 'real' Job out of college and they asked me to sign an NDA the same day they told me to not come in anymore.,NDAdvice,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dtu6u/my_first_real_job_out_of_college_and_they_asked/,"I took a 3 month 'trial' job at a creative company. I was the 4th employee there. 2 bosses, 1 intern, and me. When I started, I wasn't given any sort of contract, which I assumed is what happened with interns. Stupid yes, but seeing as this was my first position out of school I figured thats what happens. 

3 Months passed and they decided to 'keep me around.' When it came to pay they said ""The money is coming 'soon.'""  I realized soon was always going to be another 1 month away. I was promptly ignored when I asked for a salary and a ""daily rate"" was given to me. It was $100/day for 3 days a week. I was offered money for a cell phone as incentive to ""stick around"" and wait for the ""big money"" however this offer got denied when they realized how much a cell phone costs. It's not like they were spending much on me anyway, so what the hell?

I decided I was going to quit, but stick around long enough to pick up a last check. I had to stick it out about one more week, so when I was asked to sign an NDA it seemed like I should have as to not blow my 'IM QUITTING!' cover. Well, I signed it and was told ""don't come in on monday."" The conversation lasted an hour or so, but I was told I was irresponsible and hadn't been doing my work.

I was getting paid for 3 of the 5 days I was going in and did at least 7 types of jobs while I was there. This included taking extra work my boss 'couldn't finish' because he was 'busy' which actually meant he was either watching South Park or checking up on former employees.

[Heres the NDA - As you can see, it's not very much. From what I can tell, I'm really just not allowed to tell you 'oh company X spent THIS much on advertising.'](http://imgur.com/0FcgT.png) 

TL;DR - First job out of college I got taken advantage of. How much can I legally say to try and help others avoid similar fates? Does the NDA even do anything considering it was signed 30 minutes before they told me to not come in?

edit - Yes I know I should have signed something. Post college me said ""whatever! my employer knows what he's doing! this is fine and dandy!"" Man I sure got a reality check x_X

edit 2 - No I'm not posting the company name. This was mostly so I could get some advice on the situation, not seek revenge."

Technically, I'm an intern, but it's really just a title they give to me because they can't afford to pay me a full salary. Anyway, sometimes when the
photographers are tied up they'll send me out on photo assignments.
Today, it happened that they needed me to meet up with one of our
senior reporters who was at a public school waiting for the kids to be
let out. Yesterday, a food fight erupted that turned into a full scale
riot. It appears to have been racially motivated--every cop in Jersey
City responded and several people were taken to the hospital.

Anyhow, I got to the school and met up with my reporter, who was
shooting the shit with one of the city detectives (a really nice guy
who is sympathetic to the press).Cops had the entire school surrounded and were all over the premises in case violence was to erupt again.

Everything was going fine, until the bell rang. Kids started pouring
out of the school, and I stepped up on the sidewalk by the fence to
snap a few pictures. Suddenly, a female security guard starts power
walking towards me shouting that I was breaking the law on school
property.

Obviously, I knew I wasn't, so I tried to explain to her that the
sidewalk is public property that I was well within my rights, but a
statement like that just goes nowhere. She was getting in my face,
trying to force me off the sidewalk, and telling me to give her my
camera (which belongs to me, not the paper). I refused, and she didn't
try anything as I'm a big guy compared to her. I started to think that
maybe I could be wrong, and that I couldn't take pictures on the
sidewalk after all.

At this point I was pretty mad, so I took a step off the curb onto the street and took a picture of her. I don't have to tell you that this angered her. I know I shouldn't have provoked her. But I inherited my dad's temper, and I have this unnaturally strong need to smack the beehive sometimes (I guess I'm a troll).

So she's shrieking at me at this point and gets on her radio to call
the school's administration. I told her that she could go get the
police if she wanted. She did. While she left I used the opportunity
to get my shots, but then was approached by her, a JC cop, and the
school's principal. The cop asked me to leave, and the reporter I was
with (he's older and more experienced, and I'm 24 and graduated from Rutgers with a degree in journalism in May) told him that we would cross the street to be nice, but that the sidewalk was public property.

They were satisfied enough with that. But then, we got what we needed and left, and I noticed that I was being followed by the school's security truck down Montgomery Ave, and they were on the phone presumably feeding information about my car to the police or
something.

I'm not worried about action being taken against me, but it's very
unnerving to be placed in that position against your will--I really
didn't know what I was getting into.

Anyhow, that's my first experience with something like that and it
definitely wasn't fun. I know I would have been arrested had I pursued
my rights on the spot, with no recourse."

Any good financial advice?",mloy,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/du1qb/got_my_first_job_frugit_any_good_financial_advice/,"Hey so I am a college freshman, and I have around $200 sitting in my bank account that I just got from my great aunt as a graduation present out of nowhere. (My family is pretty awesome, and I love everybody in it.) I was broke at the time, but my parents raised me to be frugal so I'm used to not having money.

So, I figured the $200 would last me a while, at least until I got a job. A week after the present, I found the perfect job! I applied for it, a graphic design internship, and just got hired. This is my first job, and I'll get 8.50 an for 10 hours a week, working from my room.

My question is, what should I do with all of this income? I have a meal plan so I hardly ever spend money on food, I am living in the dorms so I don't have a monthly rent to pay, so I am planning on saving most of the money. Should I invest it in stocks? Mutual funds? Put it into CDs or make a savings account? Any and all advice will be much appreciated! I don't want to just blow all of the money I make right after I get it. I am tempted to get a smartphone, for example, but I know that I will be perfectly fine without one and that it's probably a waste of money. I feel like if I start saving now it will really pay off later.

I also need to know what to do with the $200. I've spent maybe $20 of it so far, so it would be more accurate to call it the $180; however, my question remains the same! Should it go into savings, stocks, etc.?

tl;dr What is the smartest thing to do with excessive disposable income?

I found this subreddit via r/random one day, and I feel like I could use your suggestions right about now.

Here's some background:

I'm an Asian 20F in a respected, Caucasian male-dominated tech school. I can count the number of people I've dated on one hand, and recount every kiss I've ever had. I've honestly never had a boyfriend. While I enjoy being alone, I still love to go out and party with friends - I'm very much in the partying phase of my life. I do wish I had someone to cuddle and hold hands with sometimes.

Anyways, in my freshman year of college, I got involved in one of the clubs on campus. I happened to notice that the club's president (who is a year ahead) was pretty cute. Fast forward to middle of my sophomore year, I got asked by the president (I'll just refer to him as the boy now) himself to join as a club officer, since one of the officers was away on foreign exchange. I accepted, and joined a whole new social circle of friends, all of whom I love to just chill and party with.

A few weeks later (just before this spring), I just upped and asked him out. I knew he was going across the country for half a year for some pretty important internships, and I figured better late than never. He accepted and we had a date, but it was awkward and stiff. He let me know after that he wasn't looking for a relationship at the moment - I was alright with that, and let it go.

A few weeks after that, I was over at his place for an after-party for a concert that happened that night. I had a few friends from another campus with me, and they needed to make a long drive back, but their stuff was in my room. I gave them my keys and partied on - I had the green light to crash on the sofa at the boy's house. A group of us took a stroll later on, and when him and I got back to the house, we realized that the couches already had people passed out on them. Sucking it up, we decided to share the bed. Emboldened by I-don't-even-know-what (and partially sleeplessness), I asked him if he turned me down because he was not interested, or just because he was busy. He said it was because he was busy, and wasn't willing to start a relationship that was long-distance right off the bat. We got talking, and agreed to try and see how it would go in the remaining time we had left together (2-3 weeks approximately?). We ended up hooking up, but didn't go all the way.

After the weekend passed and hearing no word from him, I texted and called him, and received reluctant responses. What probably hurt the most was the feeling of being ignored and avoided, but I didn't want to bother him since I knew he was busy. The day before he was supposed to leave, he went around and visited everybody, including some friends that lived in the same building as me. He knew I lived there, but he didn't visit me.

I eventually managed to corner him, and got an answer I suspected: no, and that he would be back in the winter.

Fast forward to this past weekend - he came back for a short visit, and of course held a party. He's 21, and like myself, also very much into his partying phase of life. I more or less got over him, and just went up, shook his hand, and was like, ""let's be friends."" We were chill and had a great time at the party. Up until this point, very few people knew that we went out before. Partly out of drunkeness and partly out of residual underlying interest, we somehow ended up kissing in front of everyone. No big, the night went on.

A whole group of us went out for pizza with a sober D. Afterwards, we all got dropped off at our respective places. As the boy was exiting, he gave me this look, but I just stared back and ignored it. When I got dropped off at my place, I received a message from him. We talked back and forth, and eventually he walked over to my place to pick me up. Just walking over to his place and holding his hand, I felt like I was on the top of the world. I was vehement that I wasn't into one night stands, and he said the same. I ended up sleeping with him - it was my first time, and I'm near certain it was his as well. I don't regret it at all; the sex wasn't perfect, but it was fun. Were we drunk? Yes. But not enough that we weren't aware of what we were doing.

The next morning, we just lazed about together and slept together again. I left his place mid-afternoon - we both had work to do. I called him the next day and asked if he wanted to meet up again. He said he was going to show up at an event the club was holding, the night before he was going to leave. He showed up late, and talked to a few people. I didn't get more than a passing glance and a ""hi."" I've invited him to hang out with me a few times, but every time he had other plans. It was understandable, since he was here for a very short time and made plans beforehand. Regardless, I felt that he could've spared half an hour to just relax together, work and other people aside.

I'm confused, RA. I feel like I've gone back to being ignored. I'm not sure what he wants from me, and tbh, I'm not sure what I want from him.

I like him, but I'm very much a realist. I can't make him like me, and I can't make him start a relationship with me. In all reality, he comes back to finish school this winter, before he graduates. Then, he'll most likely be back on the other side of the country working, while I still have another year of school to finish. Should I even bother to pursue him when he comes back?

I'm not sure what to do anymore, I feel as if I'm a fish floundering out of water. Help, RA?"

My question is regarding AISEC, ""The World's Largest Student Driven Organization"". I have googled it but I haven't been able to find out much about it, so I thought I'd tap into the hive mind.
From what I've gathered AISEC is a student-based volunteering organisation with a pretty impressive global reach. They seem to be represented at my university as well and I've noticed some people getting involved in it. But something seems not right about it:

1) There seems to be a very pervasive business discourse - members have elaborate pretentious corporate sounding titles, and seem to 'compete' to get elected into those positions. There is a lot of talk about 'leadership' and 'developing potential' and similar phrases which I find quite out of place at an organization which claims to be basically a global grassroots thing.

2) The organisation doesn't seem to offer anything other than some lofty promises of the 'global family' kind - think UNESCO but run by students, for students. It looks like members get very involved in it and spend a lot of time, but the only product they seem to produce is ""OE+"", which is an exchange program which gets students to pay (!) to fly to a foreign country (often third world) and work for free. It also seems to offer 'internships' which appear to be basically the same, but oddly, the different local businesses/NGO's seem to compete for people to come to them. According to [this](http://aiesecadest.blogspot.com/) post local chapters have to fulfill a certain quota of such exchanges.
If you look at the AISEC website it says this under [Partner with AISIEC](http://www.aiesec.org/cms/aiesec/AI/partners/index.html)

&gt;AIESEC engages with thousands of companies and organisations to support their highly competitive international talent acquisition and consistent global employer branding.

and further down:

&gt;Interns work full time anywhere from 2-18 months.
&gt;Interns demonstrate a range of skills and impact by handling specific short term projects or working in a team on long term strategies.

3) Odd organization - again, it seems very hierarchical with various pretentious sounding names and acronyms for committees, sub-committees, plenaries etc. In the U.S., it seems to be set up as a commercial entity.

Does anyone have any experience with this organization and can enlighten me? Does this organization actually offer something, or is it really just a pretty smart way to harness young people's enthusiasm and funnel their free labour to broke NGO's, language schools etc.?

Thanks :)

As a long time lurker (on various accounts), I've seen the power of the reddit network and the huge number of obscure connections and coincidences it brings.

I am posting today to try and exercise this network to find a Computer or Software engineering internship / work experience in Europe, from January-May, 2011 - prior to me beginning a Masters degree in August.


-----------------------------


A bit of background on me and my plans:

* I am 23 and an Australian citizen.  I am eligible for any working holiday visas offered to Australians (Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden).  Furthermore, I should not have a problem getting visas for other countries if sponsored - I am single, university educated and I have no criminal record, no medical problems and no dependents.  I will be traveling to Europe on a German working holiday visa, so I can also search for jobs while I am there.

* In three weeks, I am traveling to Europe as part of an Australian sporting team, representing Australia in a world championships sporting event.  If at all possible, I do not intend to return to Australia

* I graduated university at the end of 2009 with the double degree:  BEng(Computer Engineering)(Hons 1C) + BSci(Computer Science)

* I am hoping to start a Masters degree in Europe (location based on which degree I am accepted for).  I am hoping for Zurich or Munich.

* I have worked since the beginning of the year in technology consulting, but did not enjoy it as much as the various research projects that I was involved with during my 5 years at uni.  I am looking to move into the R&amp;D field and am hoping that a masters degree will help me with this.

* I am enthusiastic, independent and very capable of learning new technologies and concepts

* I am a native English speaker and have been learning German at night-school for a year, but having never immersed myself, I would not say I am by any means fluent - I can read and write conversational German with much more confidence than I can speak and understand it - but I am keen to learn and plan to make full use of being surrounded by language and culture!



My current plan, assuming everything works out is:


* Nov: Sport

* Dec: Sport

* Jan: Work

* Feb: Work

* Mar: Work

* Apr: Work

* May: Work, then start to travel towards the end of May

* Jun: Travel

* July: Travel

* Aug: Finish up with travel and start to study

* Onwards:  Masters degree until 2013.




If you are interested in reading more about me, I have uploaded a resume (with most identifying information rescinded) **[here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/200153/Squirrl%20-%20Resume%20%28blanked%29.pdf)**


**If you are interested in my full resume - PM me and I will link you to my complete resume, contact details and references if required.**




I'm happy to answer any questions you may have, but would prefer not to publicly announce my identity.

Cheers,
Squirrl


-----------------------------


**TL;DR:** As I am over in Europe at the end of 2010 for sport, but do not begin a Masters degree until August, I am hoping to find some computer/software engineering work experience to help pay cost of living and allow me to stay in Europe during this transition time

Just now, seeing The Wall by Pink Floyd on satellite TV, I caught it just before ""The Trial"" began.

will you come to my aid in my struggles to build a new gaming machine?

My goal for this machine is to be able to play a variety of games on high or good settings. I care about noise, and also about upgradeability.

-----------------------------

**Here are some questions:**

1.	The reason I'm paying for the “Pro” in the motherboard is that this one supports SLI. Will upgrading (with a second identical GPU) in the future work well with this motherboard and the rest of the machine?

2.	What do you think of the general noisiness of this machine?

3.	I have the option of buying the same thing from another store at a slightly different price with some components changing, do you think these changes would be upgrades or downgrades? The changes would be:

GPU turns into *Gainward GTX 460 1gb Golden Sample* instead of the Gigabyte with the same numbers

PSU turns into *Corsair TX 650W* instead of the OCZ

HD turns into *Western Digital  Caviar Green Power 1TB 3Gb/s 64Mb Cache* instead of the Samsung

I currently have one job offer for a software engineering role and have two second round interviews coming up with the big 4 for a consulting role where I will most likely get an offer.  

This past summer I did an SE internship in Silicon valley with a large software company. I currently have an offer from them and would be living and working in California where I would be starting off at 76k and a 10k relocation bonus. I may be able to negotiate to 80-85k.
 
This sounds great but I hated my job / company culture at my internship.  Most the engineers were introverted and I had no one to talk to at work.  Most the employees were older and had been working at the company for a while and were never excited about anything.  I also didn't like San Jose that much.

I had an office visit to a big 4 office in NYC and really liked the employees and atmosphere.  However, I am not sure if consulting would be any better.  I would most likely be making less starting at around 60k.  The cost of living in NYC is also a lot higher than California.  In Cali, I could continue to live like a college student and save up 40k in a year.   In NYC, I feel like I would be living paycheck to paycheck.  

Should I make the smart decision and go with the higher paying job where I would make 20k-30k more a year at the company I know I disliked?  Or should I take a risk and accept a Consulting position that pays less and I may dislike just as much?  Consulting would be about (20% travel) and working in forensics(enterprise stuff).  It sounds cool but I am not sure if it is. 


Ideally, I'd like to take a semester off to intern for a start-up before graduating to see how I like it but my dad may be loosing his construction job soon so my parents are pressuring me to graduate on time.

I am sure there a lot of people on reddit who have worked in both roles so give me your ideas.   Has anyone here worked in Penetration Testing or Forensics?  What do you think about it?  

**tldr: Choose high paying Software Engineering job at company I didnt like or go with a lower paying consulting job at Big 4 firm?**

We've been together for about a year now, and have been really close, rarely leaving each others side. I stay at her place 6/7 nights a week, we split groceries and all the works. I love being with her, we make each other laugh constantly. I've never had so much fun just hanging out with someone.

On to the bad parts. Sex life sucks. Maybe once a week, and there is no flexibility no blowjobs, no adventures, no regularity. I think it stems from her low self esteem (she is pretty overweight) but it makes things sometimes frustrating for me. We've talked about it and she agrees to work on it, but never with results. Also she is very temperamental and subject to mood swings. I've never been with another girl this seriously so I don't know if it's normal. When I leave she is much less functional and gets depressed. I left for a week to my place to study and she quit attending class. She is very dependant on me. I've been contemplating breaking up with her but have always found the thought of hurting her too revolting. I really do love her.

So I got offered a great internship with a well known company 1000km away. I want to take it, but it'll crush her. She'll fall into a slump if I leave. I have been considering taking a lesser job locally to make her happy. She spent a lot of last night crying, thinking I might be leaving. She can't come because she still attends school for the first 4 months of my job. But it's only an 8 month internship.

Does anyone have any advice for how I can put myself first without feeling shitty for hurting her? I know the right thing to do is break up with her and take the job, but I can't bring myself to put her through that. The thought of making her cry is almost enough for me to lower my career goals and stay here. I just need advice on how to get over it and do the right thing for myself."

I started an internship in May developing software for a small company.  They asked me to come in full time for the summer.  I have two semesters left in school, and since this Fall semester started, I've had to cut my work hours down to 10-12 hours a week.

Near the end of the summer I was assigned a really big project.  I started working on it then, and got quite a lot done.  I presented what I had done to my boss and the sales guys, and everyone really liked it.  I let them know where I was in the development process, and what all I needed to finish up.  I pretty much made it sound like I could easily finish it up in a few weeks.

So here's the problem:
Ok, so that was two months ago.  I still don't have this project done.  I don't slack...I mean, I do take breaks and get distracted by the Internets sometimes.  But overall, I work hard.  I understand how software development goes, and how it usually takes longer than expected, but my boss has been pressuring me lately to get this software wrapped up.  He's also been having me write a manual (documentation) at the same time.  I'm making good progress on this software, considering how little I work now, but it seems like the more I get done, the more I realize there is to do.  Plus, I still have to test the software after I'm done with it, which means more bug-stomping.

I don't know if this is even clear at all, but I'm overwhelmed and pretty frustrated.  There is only one other developer, and he has even more work to do (he's full-time), so it's not like I can ask him to help me out.  I'm having a hard time explaining this situation to my boss when he asks for updates on my progress.  I don't want him to think I'm getting nothing done, because I am!  There's just so much to do really, and it doesn't help that most of the things I'm writing in this project are brand new to me.

I don't know...I'm a little flustered, so hopefully this post makes a little sense.  Any advice?  Has anyone else experienced something like this?"

I am  about to complete a degree in Criminal Justice ( i know complete opposite), however I have always had a passion for computers also. I took a computer repair course back in high school (graduated in 05) and been fixing computers for family and friends ever since. I also helped at times testing hardware for a family friends small ebay business.
 

Here is the problem I want to try out IT work seeing as I really like working with computers. Plus the whole criminal justice field is not doing to well unless you want to move to the border in Texas or Arizona. My SO and I rather stay here in Orange County. Every job I have looked at for IT work requires some kind of degree or certs and will not even look at my resume seeing as I have no formal work experience. I have been applying and searching for jobs but they all require experience and it seems no companies will take you without any experience. So i am trying to find some kind of internship or volunteer work. If you guys have any ideas to gain experience for this let me know also please.


So I am looking at getting either an AA degree in Computer Information Systems or some kind of cert such as a the community college has a PC/Networking Hardware Cert. The thing is the AA degree they offer seems to have nothing to do with networking or hardware. The courses include: Access, Excel, Accounting, And word processing. So am i better off with AA in pretty much basic computer skills which i already have or going with an actual Cert. The cert courses include: Operating Systems, PC Hardware Configs, Intro Networking Hardware, Computer Desktop Support, Windows Server Administration. 


So which one do you guys think would be the best to help get my feet into IT/Network door? Eventually I might pursue a computer forensics cert in order to use both computers and criminal justice.

My position in the company does not involve management or hiring people, but would probably be asked for my professional opinion should the question ever come up.

So while there technically isnt a problem here, I still kind of feel that there might be  enough of a power balance issue here for it to be fair of me to ask her out.

I tend to overanalyze stuff like this, so in a normal situation I would just ask her out for a coffee or something to get it off my mind so to speak. But in addition to all the potential dating coworkers issues involved, I guess I would feel like a dick just for asking.

My question is; should I sit this one out, at least until the businessy stuff has been resolved?"

If I can't get anywhere with my portfolio by just working 4 days a week, then perhaps I shouldn't bother going with graphics.   I might go part time if I decide to take my work and become very serious with it and have a clear/certain path in my life.  I don't know why, but your advices simply help me clear up my mind even though I should have been capable of coming up with them on my own.

This is probably not going to be as interesting as other posts you can find here, but I always felt that reddit could come up with some great advice, and I would appreciate even just a few regarding this matter(my first time posting ).  

I majored as an art student(3d animation), and I was pretty ok at it(best on my class, but my school was not as good compared to others - had to learn mostly everything on my own).  Because of some circumstances, I wasn't able to get a job right away, turned down some internships, and eventually had to work as a waiter to help support my parents.  Eventually, I was hired by a company(not related to my studies) that recruits international students, and I am now working full time as a tutor/assistant manager.  The job is easy, but I am not getting anything from it.  I hate dealing with the people at the company and   I am also sick of the kids and tutoring.  The pay is not bad ($40,000), and with the economy the way it is, I am thankful I have it.  
I've been trying to work on my portfolio(my old stuff is outdated, and must update my work) for years and get some stuff done so I could find either an internship or go back to school and get an MFA.  Unfortunately, I've procastinated too much on it, and after a day of work, I just don't want to do anything.
I was told that one of the reasons why I was not inclined to work on my portfolio or to find something better is because I just didn't have time and because I felt comfortable with my job.
Now some of the reasons why I don't want to change the way my life is  because the economy(feel lucky to have an easy job), the uncertainty that even after working on my portfolio maybe I won't be able to find a job(it's hard getting into this industry), and of course I hate change.
 
I know that some people might say that I should follow my dreams, but sometimes I find that type of mindset to be a bit unrealistic. 

Anyway, I have talked to my boss about it, and he has been supportive about it and even gave me fridays off(not much work on fridays anyways) so I could do something with my life, but he said that he still needs me at the company and doesn't want me to go part time.   I am considering just telling him that I want to work about 4 hours a day(tutoring only)instead so I can spend more time on my own work.  This means that I'll be paid only a fraction of what I was getting paid before.  I do have some money saved up, and I should be able to survive for a good 6-8 months or more.

Anyways, depending on the advice I get from you guys,  I will either keep the way things are or take a risk and focus on an uncertain future.

Thanks Reddit."

Since Sunday morning my cat is in pain when someone touches his back or his stomach (he cries and hiss) and doesn't move. He's at the vet since then, but they don't know why he's in such pain; they've already done:

* blood analysis: low white blood cells count
* urine analysis: presence of bacteria
* x-rays: nothing
* ultrasound: nothing

He doesn't eat and he's under analgesics, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics.

He's an old cat (at least 12 years old), he's diabetic but under control with insulin and was fine Saturday night. I'm beggining to loose hope :-(  So I decided to turn to reddit and see if anyone had any ideas.

[Here he is, this summer, in much better shape](http://imgur.com/V1QRN.png)

**UPDATE:** Some more information (not good though):
It seems he's fighthing a pancreatitis, but no renal failure (It was one of my first thought).

However, I was able to visit him Tuesday and he's ""not fully there"" (confused, walking in circles, not really reacting). They're giving him metacam (definitely [not ideal](http://www.metacamkills.com), but they said that they can't give him anything else, since he's diabetic) and tolfedine both of which may partially explain his state. He cries less when we touch him (only when holding him), he let me pet him, but I'm not even sure he recognized me :-( :-(

Yesterday we agreed to another exam, and they found a mass in his brain which is probably the cause of all his pain. I'm meeting with them this afternoon to see what to do but I think I know where this is going and I can't stop crying.

[Another picture of him in the kitchen, wondering how come he's not eating yet](http://imgur.com/BDztv.png)

TL;DR The vets found a mass in my cat's brain, I'll probably loose my best friend.

**UPDATE2:** It's all over, after discussing with the intern, the doctor and the oncologist: there's no hope to save him. With the tumor, the diabetes, the pancreatitis, the back pains, they gave him a very low chance of recovery with an acceptable quality of life (1/10), if he didn't die during the treatments. We had to decide to euthanize him. He was fine Saturday night and 5 days later he's now dead. I feel terrible and don't know how to go on."

I'm a college aged guy who's been in a relationship for about 14 months.  Before this relationship, i had known the girl, who I'll call Sarah, pretty well and sort of knew that she liked me for some time.  I wasn't really looking for a relationship at the time, I had just left another 7 month relationship in a pretty bad way and wanted to distance myself from that world for a while.  So i did the usual college hook-up thing, getting with a few girls that she knew about and a few that she didn't, but was just being the usual college single guy.  After a while, and after we had gotten to know each other we started dating.  She left the country to study abroad for a short semester, about 4 months, while i continued to take classes at my current university.  During this time I didn't even consider touching another girl and after she came back we lived together for 2 months over the summer so she wouldn't have to pay rent while taking summer classes.  Since then we have moved into different places, hers about a block and half away from mine.  Since then we haven't seen as much of each other, obviously, because she always has tons of homework and I'm working on projects or working for my aunt, but we still see each other pretty much every night.  During the time that she was gone I became legal to drink and had started going to $2 pint night at the irish bar downtown with one of my roomates (guy) and a friend (girl) whom I had known a year longer than my girlfriend.  We continued this for a little while after the newest semester started but it got harder and harder to line up everyone's schedule to get it to work and so we broke it off.  Since then I have had very very broken contact with the girl.  
Sorry for the long backstory but here's the part that is the issue.  Last weekend, my girlfriend went home for an internship interview and my roommate and i were going to party like we do most weekends and he made a mention that the girl i used to go to the bar with texted him (my roommate) about a week ago asking what my number was because she lost it with her phone she drowned, and i thought ""Hey, i wonder if she wants to come drink tonight?""  Well it turns out that she was out of town celebrating a birthday of her friends, no big deal.  So i proceed to get wasted, fall down some stairs and spend the next day throwing up, status quo.  My girlfriend gets back, asks about the weekend, asks who was there, the usual battery of questions and she explodes on me with ""You only text that girl when I'm not here!""  I calmly tried to explain that it didn't even cross my mind and i had only texted her because my roommate reminded me of it, but she insists it's ""very suspicious"". 
So here's where i need advice, she has shown her trust issues in the past, always trying to look who I'm texting, which i rarely do, constantly asks me who was at our house and what happened, texts my roommates and asks them what happened, compares our stories, and she gets really really jealous of the girls i made out with/had sex with before we were dating.  And in return i ask her nothing about her life, she texts constantly, does homework with other guys and it honestly doesn't bother me because i trust that our relationship means more than a random hook up.  I don't know what to do to change this paranoia.  

It's important to state that i have never once cheated on my girlfriend.

TL;DR
Girlfriend exploded due to a coincidence with a firend (girl) and acts very suspicious of me even though I have never even come close to cheating on her.  Wondering how to help trust issues."

What now?,throw54321away,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dxaju/she_says_she_wishes_shed_met_me_later_in_life/,"I figure I'll just try and write down all the relevant info I can think of here, and I kind of need to get the whole story out there for my own sake, so I apologize in advance for rambling.

I'm 22 and she's 23, and we've been dating for almost exactly 1 year now. When we first met, things were going really well. She was finishing up college (business communication major) and I was in my 1st (and most grueling) year of grad school. She had originally gone to college as part of a specialized acting program, but had dropped out without finishing after feeling fed-up with the people and being concerned about the pragmatics of being a career actress. Before meeting her, I had never had a serious girlfriend but a few flings here and there. To be honest I was a little inexperienced, having lost my virginity only around a year before we met. Either way, we met at a bar and had a great ""official"" first date a few days later. 

Towards the beginning of the summer, she started getting anxious about what she'd do after graduating. She had had a few PR internships, but when we talked about them she seemed unsatisfied. Around that time, I asked her what she'd really truly want to do with her life (ignoring money) and she said she wanted to act, so I encouraged her to follow her passion. For a little while after, she was considering heading to L.A., where she thought she had to be to pursue acting. This would mean essentially breaking up, as I live and go to school on the east coast. We talked seriously about it for weeks, and in the end she decided to stay where she was, and even moved to an apartment in my neighborhood and got a waitressing job there, too. Throughout all of this our relationship remained strong, and I would say it get even stronger with her deciding to move a little closer by. 

Throughout our relationship I feel like I've gone out of my way to be a source of support and advice for this girl. It seems like the majority of our conversations would inevitably turn towards her: her anxieties about her coworkers, her insecurities about acting, etc. Most of the time I was okay with this, seeing as how I was in a relatively stable position in my life (in school) and she was going through this crazy transition. I wanted to be there for her, I sort of felt that it was my duty.  

Anyway, last weekend I went out of state with my mother and sister to visit my grandmother. My granny doesn't have much time left, and I hadn't seen her for too long so I considered it a family obligation. Suffice it to say that this trip was a little depressing for me. Before leaving and during the trip, I noticed that my GF seemed a lot more distant when I talked to her over the phone. I was often bored during the trip, and would call her and not receive a response, or have a brief, rushed conversation with her. When I got back, I noticed that she was still acting like this, so I asked her about it. At first she told me she was just maybe a little depressed and stressed out (she worked hard over the weekend). 

She was still acting this way last night, and so I asked her about it again. I told her she seemed distant and could tell me if there was anything on her mind. She started to cry and told me that she was feeling weird about being in a relationship at this stage of her life. She told me she thought I was perfect, but she gets the feeling sometimes of missing out on life because she's in a serious relationship. She said she wished she had met me later in life when she wouldn't feel this way. 

As you can imagine, hearing this was hard. I told her I'd be lying if I didn't feel the same way sometimes, but the stability of a serious girlfriend was something I'd grown to appreciate. I suggested we consider taking some time away from one another for a little while. She wanted to know what the terms of some ""time away"" would be, and I told her I wasn't sure. We agreed to keep talking about it. 

I'd like to hear an outside perspective on this, reddit. Being that close to somebody for the first time is an eye-opening experience, and I wonder if my willingness to give advice and put her before myself has made me seem weak or dependent. It might sound awful, but I'm afraid of resenting her for all the effort I put into the relationship. 

Whaddyya think?

**Edit:** TL;DR - She says she feels like she's missing out on life because of our serious relationship, but thinks I'm great. I try to be super supportive, and I suggested some time apart. What are your suggestions?"
dxb78,2,2010-10-27,Girlfriend wants to get engaged now.,panzero0,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dxb78/girlfriend_wants_to_get_engaged_now/,"TL;DR - I'm a 25 year old professional and she is a 22 y/o grad student with one semester of school left and a 15 week internship out of town. She wants to get engaged before her internship but I don't want to be engaged and alone for 15 weeks of our engagement.

First of all, I initially didn't want to get engaged for another year but she is pressuring me. I've somewhat given in to her pressure and we've looked at rings, yada yada yada. EDIT: We've been dating for just over a year

Secondly, her internship experience will be much better if it's out of town and her chances of getting a great job are a lot higher if she goes out of town. There are opportunities nearby but they suck and it won't look great on her resume.

I may have an unwarranted fear because my sister tried a long distance engagement and it didn't work out. 

Should I be celebrating time alone? She is normally the one that is so clingy, I just think it would be so strange to be committed to someone that is so intangible, so to speak.

EDIT: It'd be so much easier for us if we just waited until she was done with school. Why can't she wait?

dxcpg,1,2010-10-27,"Reddit, I've realized I may have wasted 4 years at college, should I (potentially) waste another 4?",breamae23,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/dxcpg/reddit_ive_realized_i_may_have_wasted_4_years_at/,"Hi Reddit, So way back when (4 years ago) I started college at a state school. The first two years were up and down between becoming a English teacher or getting a theater degree. I ended up going down the theater degree path, with the idea that I would apply to grad school to get my library science degree and become a librarian. This was so I could get my theater degree and do what I love, (stage managing and working in theater), and also make some money being a librarian. Well I've come to realize thru intense research and internships that I do not like being a librarian. It's just not for me. And now I'm facing my diploma in a few months with essentially a useless degree in something I love. Now, my thought is this, when I first started school I loved the idea of becoming a graphic designer, but I was intimidated with the idea of pursuing. I thought everyone else would be so much better than me, I wouldn't know what I was doing, blah blah blah, long story short I let my low self esteem get the best of me and I didn't pursue it. So my question now is this, is it worth doing another four years at school to get my degree? I would be totally starting from square one, but I would be getting a degree in something that I could make more money in and have more opportunities for jobs. I know it would be hard work, it would be going into an entirely different field. I'm going to talk to an advisor today to see what she thinks. I've thought about going to a community college in town for the first year, it'd be cheaper and I could see if I am doing the right thing. Then I could transfer to the state school and get my BA in graphic design. Right now, if I graduate with a theater degree, I would basically be jumping from job to job working on shows and not making a lot of money (at first), and I've realized that with my family health history I really need a job that can provide money and/or benefits.
I know I may seem a little lost and not very knowledgeable on the subject, but I'm a little shaky at the thought that I've just thrown away 4 years and may be heading down a totally different, unknown area. But I am willing to work so hard at this degree! Graphic design seems like such an amazing area to get into, and I know it won't magically be the answer to my problems, but I just want what everyone wants, a little security for the future, the ability to take care of myself and my parents and any family I may have in the future. I would appreciate any insight you have for me, if you see any red flags about this whole situation. Thank you so much for reading.

edit: I have had financial aid and scholarships pay for school the first four years, so I don't have much debt. I would basically be applying for financial aid to pursue this and apply for some grants and other scholarships.

TL;DR Should I pursue a degree in graphic design and go down a totally different career path after I've already spent four years getting a degree in a different unrelated field?"

I graduated from college about 2 years ago and I messed around at a couple non-web corporate jobs until I realized that I wanted to focus on web development as a career path.  When applying, I had no agency experience and my portfolio was pretty weak (web development had always been a hobby of mine -- I have only been *paid* by friends/friends-of-friends to make simple static HTML sites...), but I was persistent and somehow convinced the President to bring me on-board.  

I've been here for about 8 months now and things have been going well.  The boss hired me purely because of my interest in the subject and my ability to sell myself -- he didn't really have any idea what he would do with me (My compensation reflects that -- I'm paid like a well-paid intern w/ no benefits).  I've since been involved in almost every aspect of agency life: HTML, CSS, JQuery, Project Management, Production Management, QA, Research/Digital Strategy...I've run client meetings, I've managed a small team of developers, UX designed two small sites...kind of everything.  

I was reviewing a project plan for an upcoming project (I was asked to take a look at the functional requirements) and noticed the rate at which my services were being billed...nearly 5x what I am paid by my agency.  I went back and looked at another project I worked on and my services were billed at the same rate. This stood out as ridiculous to me...they're billing the client the same cost as a person 2-3 levels higher than me in terms of seniority.  Keep in mind, I am still very inexperienced in the agency world and I am the youngest in the office (early twenties), but don't you think an 80% margin on my services is a little bit odd?  I mean, Apple has a 40% margin and that's unheard of.

Is this just one of the ""pay your dues"" things?  Should I say something? Maybe my angst is lingering around from when I was a teenager, but I work a lot longer hours and a lot more projects than most of the people here and seemingly am compensated significantly less.  I don't know what to do.

dxhop,1,2010-10-27,Need CS Career Advice...,purplegui,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dxhop/need_cs_career_advice/,"Hi all,

**Background:**
I am currently a senior CS major at a top-tier-ish public university and will graduate next June. I interned this past summer as a software engineer and the position has been extended into a PT position until the end of this calendar year. That, however, is also my first and only internship experience. I have limited research experience, as well (just starting).

What I gathered from my internship experience is this: I am not satisfied with sitting in a cube write code all day. I want to work on challenging problems. I don't want to write bitch code (perhaps part of being an intern?). Also, the experienced affirmed my belief that, in CS, experience trumps education (to a degree). If given the initial opportunity, 4 years of work experience trumps 4 years of college education.

**That said, here's my question:**
I'm now at a time where my decision would most likely affect how the rest of my life plays out.

Should I get a job after getting the B.S.? It seems to me this means getting a job that would be pure coding 24/7. That, of course, could be good or bad, depending on the projects I work on. I would also be able to be independent.

Should I go for an M.S.? An M.S. in Com Sci would give me some boost in salary, but would cost me another year or so of tuition and life. Is it worth it? Does it open that many more doors?

Lastly, the Ph.D. It requires a great amount of dedication. It requires around 4~6 years of my life. However, most colleges pay for your Ph.D. tuition. It doesn't give much of a salary boost compared to an M.S. However, it gives me the opportunity to do research and to teach, which I enjoy vastly.

So, reddit, I am really at a crossroads. I've given many thoughts to this subject and, with the grad school deadlines quickly approaching, I really can't delay this much longer. Your inputs are really appreciated.

Note: This is a throwaway. I don't know why I posted this under a throwaway, really. I'm a pussy?

*edit1:* My current research is in bioinformatics, if that matters."
dxj6b,10,2010-10-28,I made a web site for a school project for a real photographer. Should I try and contact him to see if he wants it?,NastyBigPointyTeeth,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/dxj6b/i_made_a_web_site_for_a_school_project_for_a_real/,"Here is the website he has up http://www.jamesnachtwey.com/ and here is mine http://www.bencathey.com/james/ . I am pretty sure he is retired so I don't know if he would even care. I would of course add more pictures and whatever else he would want. Is it worth trying to sell? If it is how would I go about doing that? This is my first website so I don't know anything about this.

Edit: Thanks for everyones input. I have decided to work on it some more and maybe sometime I will offer it to him for free. I do have another question though, if I want to put this in a portfolio do I have to put somewhere that it is not his, how should I do that?

Edit2: Also I am looking for a internship this summer so if anyone knows about anything let me know."

Help!,socialwkr,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dxlck/studying_to_be_a_social_worker_and_feeling_more/,"I'm studying to be a social worker right now and i've gotten to the point in my academic career where i'm having to apply for internships. I'm taking a practice 1 class this semester which basically entails getting into groups of 2 or 3 and coming up with a ""problem"" to role play and solve. Alot of questions have been brought up to the teacher on how to fix certain probelms. The thing that gets me is that, everything these girls (primarily a woman field), bring up an issue they want to resolve i've gone through it before. 

I'm feeling hopeless and depressed. I feel like my family doesn't care, and my friends don't care either. I was going to make a call to counseling services tomorrow but i'm not sure if its free and if its not, i guess i'll just have to wait. 

Thanks for any input, i think i just need someone who doesn't know me/care about me to bring up ideas to think about. I just want to know how to deal with all of this. 

Edit: these aren't just problems from school and being at school it's alot of problems and pent up feelings from years before. and certain things i've been going through. I just haven't had a reasonable outlet. I have a boyfriend but talking to him seems like he doesn't understand and everyone i talk to has the same un-empathic response: GET OVER IT. i did, it's just that being in social work and having to deal with other people who have gone through the same things i have, that i wasn't able to resolve myself, makes me feel helpless.

dxml5,2,2010-10-28,LLM Admissions in the US,llmthrowaway,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/dxml5/llm_admissions_in_the_us/,"So I recently graduated from one of the UK's top 5 law schools with a borderline 2:2 (59%) - for you Americans, thats roughly the equivalent of a B or B- - and I was wondering how tough gaining admission for an LLM program is for an international student at a top 30 law school in the US.

I come from a Middle Eastern country and I am completing my first internship there. I am about to start another internship with one of the world's largest law firms (Magic Circle firm) also here in the Mideast, and have been offered two more which means that I will have good work experience by the time I start. From what I understand, being bilingual, an international student and having solid work experience works to your advantage in the US more than it does in the UK even if your grades aren't top notch.

**tl;dr** - is it impossible to gain admission to a top 30 law school in the US if your grades are average?"

dxxwm,1,2010-10-28,Anyone ever had to rent an apartment on insufficient income?,RentIsTooDarnHigh,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dxxwm/anyone_ever_had_to_rent_an_apartment_on/," I'm looking at this as a possibility. Where I'm living right now might not last for more than a year or so. I'm 24 and never finished college, I have barely any marketable skills. (I can code a bit, I've been a host at a fine dining place and an intern, but the internship experience is not sellable, because I quit on bad terms).

With the skills that I have, I figure I'll be lucky if I can make $2000/mo after taxes. This would of course be for me working two jobs, at around 60-70 hours per week.

Basically, I'm curious if anyone else has been in this kind of situation, what it was like, if you're still trapped in it, did you get out, and so on.

EDIT: i should update to say that I live in the boston area, and rent is somewhat pricy. The lowest I can find is $600-900, but usually around $900 Thanks!"
dxz0p,5,2010-10-28,I would like some feedback from biomedical engineers- is it possible to go to grad school in biomedical engineering with decent (around a 3.1) GPA bachelors in electrical engineering?,chandrax,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/dxz0p/i_would_like_some_feedback_from_biomedical/,"I have one semester left (after this one) and am getting ready to start the grad school application process. Biomedical engineering is what I am interested in. I am passionate about electronics, micro-controllers, and electrical theory but even more than that I am passionate about using what I know to try to help people. 

So far the schools I am looking at are only the University of Madison Wisconsin (the brain-twitter research project was awesome), and Virginia Tech (I had an internship there). 

Is there another way to get into the R and D side of the biomedical industry? I am from Alaska where practically no biomedical engineering research goes on and there are no biomedical engineering companies. 

Last question: What should I do to prepare my background for grad school? Are basic biology classes a requirement (that would be worth extending by graduation date out for in order to get those classes under my belt) or would I be fine just applying with what I have? 

I'm a girl, if it makes any difference (it shouldn't but sometimes it can help one stand out from an application pile of mostly male candidates).

I'd really appreciate any comments, pieces of advice, stories, or even sammich requests (but only if you are prepared for one fitted with electrical gidgets!) :)"
dxzi4,8,2010-10-28,Reddit - Absolutely infuriated by the job hunt.  Advice?,GettingStarted22,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dxzi4/reddit_absolutely_infuriated_by_the_job_hunt/,"Hey Reddit,
So I've been looking for a job for the past few months now.  I'll admit, initially my search wasn't too strenuous, but for the past 3 months or so, I've been putting out easily 10+ Resumes/customized cover letters a week.  
I have a BA in History (I know, pretty worthless, but I did what I love), but I'm relatively tech savvy, a hard worker, and punctual.
I don't have a ton of experience in any field, my only work experience was with a company I did an internship with for two summers.  Typical office tasks, over the phone customer service, that kind of stuff.  I'm not very picky with my job choices, I just want something that isn't retail and isn't food.  Every resume I submit either gets ignored completely, or (rarely) I get a negative reply.

After 50+ applications getting rejected, I'm on the verge of giving up.  I want to work, but no matter what I do, I can't get anything worthwhile...  I've been looking on my University's (graduated now) job search website, I've been looking at the cesspool called Craigslist, I've been using Indeed.com, and I've been making phone calls to ads in papers, but still nothing.
Is there any avenue I haven't explored that's been particularly successful for you? 
Any tips/general input is appreciated.  Time and most importantly CASH is running out for me to be unemployed any longer, and I'm fucking fed up with being ignored."
dy11b,4,2010-10-28,2L trying to decide whether to stick it through. Advice?,lawschoolthrowaway,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/dy11b/2l_trying_to_decide_whether_to_stick_it_through/,"I'm a 2L at a tier 2 school. My major in undergrad was Political Science (with a minor in Spanish). I'm currently sitting at a 2.61 GPA (trying to get it up). I couldn't find anything my 1L Summer so I ended up taking classes. I'm currently searching for something, anything, for my 2L Summer and again coming up empty. The career services office is of little help (Network, they say.. as if we didn't know that). I'm active in clubs at school but I'm not currently doing moot court/law review. I find some of the material really engaging and interesting, but some of it really boring. There are times that I wonder if I did the right thing coming to Law School, but have never quit anything in my life (and don't want to especially since I'm almost halfway through). I feel like I would be letting myself down, and that friends and family wouldn't understand and think less of me. Additionally, I don't feel like my undergrad degree would be worth a damn in the job market. I am really worried about not being able to get a job and it is making me even more depressed/anxious about my situation. I am in a bit of debt, but the tuition here is low relative to other Law Schools (~$13k a year, so I would be roughly $20k in the hole if I left now). I really don't know if I have any other option but to finish. Over the past few days I've been up and down about it. One moment I'm giving myself a pep-talk about working hard and networking my ass off and the next I'm going over worst case scenarios. I fear that I won't be able to get an externship next year (I had a 1 credit pass/fail class that I had to pass this semester in order to be eligible for moot court/law review/externships etc.. I have been so anxious about this stuff I couldn't get any sleep the night before, zombied through it, and am afraid I didn't do well enough to pass, although I won't know for sure until Nov 15). I'm rambling at this point but... I just don't know where to turn. Stick it through? Drop out? Options if I do drop out?

TLDR; 2L w/ 2.61 GPA at Tier 2. Trying but failing to get internships. Stressed out and trying to decide to stay or go. "
dy1ve,1,2010-10-28,"Just starting! Lose a few lbs., get in shape",Drache,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/dy1ve/just_starting_lose_a_few_lbs_get_in_shape/,"First post here on reddit too!

I'm 21, 5'9"" 167 lbs. I'm a college student. In my high school years and the first year of college or so, it seemed I was always moving. I walked almost everywhere I could, I was semi-active, and it never seemed like I needed to worry about my diet at all. Weight was simply a non-issue. 

Flash forward a few years. I did 6 months of internship last year - typical desk job - no movement at all. No exercise, no calorie control, and lots of snacks in my desk, and the 'ol Poptarts for breakfast. I didn't think anything of it. I was back in school this summer and I tried to be more active with my free time...bike riding, hiking...and I think it was enough to maintain my weight and offset my crappy eating.

Skipping to the punchline....
Over the last year, I've gained 12 lbs., from 155 to 167, my blood pressure has gone up, I feel much less in shape. I understand that it's much easier to fix the problem now rather than later.

I'm addicted to food. I loved eating, and unhealthy meals were my way of coping with anxiety. I shoveled in chips and cookies at work when I was bored. Not so good. I've counted my calories, and realized that my diet was *very* high in carbs and sugars, and low in protein. I've been trying to make a few healthy changes....

* If I didn't consciously keep track of my calories, I could shovel in an easy 2300-2400 a day of unhealthy items without thought. Now I've cut back and can do more along the lines of 1800 with some willpower. 

* I've cut out fast food almost completely besides the occasional social outing. I make sure I pack my lunch at work (whole wheat roast beef sandwich with spinach leaves and canola oil mayo) and make sure I have some carrot sticks to nibble on. Oatmeal with dried fruit instead of poptarts. I still have my morning hot chocolate (not so great, but I use lowfat milk and the powder sparingly).

* I've exchanged soda for sparkling fruit juice. Less sugar, real fruit juice. Not ideal, but it's a start.

* I've started doing the P90 (not P90X) workout tapes. I either do that or try to get 30 or 40 minutes of bike riding or walking in each day to at least get started.

* I've tried changing my desserts to better options. A granola bar instead of cookies. Greek yogurt instead of icecream. Simple things like that to move in the right direction. 

Over the last few weeks I've probably dropped a pound or so. My principal complaint so far is I feel hungry without ""unlimited"" food. I assume it's the high carb/high sugar combo. Does anyone have any tips for lowering carbs and sugar and increasing protein to feel fuller?

I realize that 10-12 pounds shouldn't be a daunting task. I'm really hoping I can change my diet to get back into shape as well as drop some weight (it's no fun when your clothes from last year don't fit!). Hopefully soon I won't feel like I need a cardiologist on speed dial during exercise, and I'll start going down in weight instead of creeping up. Your advice, motivation, and tips are appreciated :)
