z7dlz,12,2012-09-01,Effects of Sleep and Stress on Weight Gain/Loss,redtouchyellow,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/z7dlz/effects_of_sleep_and_stress_on_weight_gainloss/,"I have been trying to lose weight, primarily by counting calories, eating healthier foods and following C25K (will begin week 6 soon!).  We went to a biking event today and I noticed how horrible i look in the full body pictures.  

So, although I have been trying to lose weight it does not look like it.  I recently started my last year of grad school, began a new internship and started a new job working night shift in the dorms leading to a lack of sleep until I get used to falling asleep sooner.

My question is, how much does stress (not the eating effects like overeating) and lack of sleep effect weight loss?  This is definitely something I will read some articles about soon, but in the mean time, what are your thoughts?"

Being from Florida, I knew nothing about the city. I heard from everyone that it was dangerous and vile. Every time I mentioned I would be spending my summer there I was told to ""have fun, bring a gun"". I tried not to build these expectations in my head, and to just go to Detroit with an open mind, but it was inevitable. 

I arrived on a really gloomy Michigan day, not only was the city entirely empty as it was the weekend but the sun did not come out for a full 2 days. It was looking like Detroit was going to meet all these expectations I tried not to set. But after spending 3 months exploring, submersing and involving myself in downtown/surrounding areas and their culture I was blown away. The history, the beautiful stories the buildings tell, the intriguing people you meet, the establishments that have just popped up in midtown to the restaurants that have been on Michigan Ave for decades. I did not even know what to do with all of it. 

No one had told me about these things, just that I shouldn't drive a foreign car and I should never speak to anyone. 

Detroit is thriving in a way people don't understand. But I am absolutely thankful that I had the chance to experience it first hand. 

Detroit did not meet my expectations, because it wasn't disgusting nor did I ever feel in danger. I was not afraid to walk around on my own, or talk to random people. I saw abandoned buildings/houses but they taught me about the past. 

Detroit is everything I wasn't expecting. It taught me about myself and about others. It showed me that simple ideas can be manifested into endeavors. It taught me to never give it. It also taught me that Northerners can't make good chicken and waffles, but damn the rest of the food y'all make is delicious. It showed me some of the most stunning architecture I have ever been privileged to witness.

That being said, I'd like to thank everyone in the area for being so welcoming and cordial. I can't wait to return next summer. 

Edit: I lived in downtown Detroit for the 3 months I spent there. I plan on returning for another 3 months next summer to live in the same place. "
z7529,1,2012-09-01,What should I do with my career and my life?,ProtagonistForHire,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z7529/what_should_i_do_with_my_career_and_my_life/,"

I graduated from Law school last year from the UK, and became a [1] barrister. Now I'm currently interning at the top law firm in my country. Unfortunately, this is a career that I absolutely hate and I'm completely miserable.

I never really had a choice with what I wanted to study at university or choose my profession. I come from a kind of typical upper-middle class, indian family (Bangladeshi to be specific), so I was raised to obey and not question. My father kind of forced me to study law, which I did for 5 years. I tried to tell him for the first two years that I didn't like it at all and don't want to be in this profession, but that really did not go anywhere. The last three years of university was just a haze of severe depression and still going strong, but I still managed to finish my 3 degrees.

After I came back home, I was lucky enough to be able to join a law firm. It is the best in the country, the people who work there are great (really intelligent and polite) and even my supervisor likes me a lot (which I heard just today through the grapevine). I'm certainly learning a lot, and everyone who hears where I work is immediately very impressed. And if I stay here I will probably be making very good money in 3 to 4 years time (I'm getting currently a salary of zero, since I'm just a lowly intern now). Honestly the only complaint I have is the 10-12 hour work day, six days a week, which would not be a problem if I loved my job since the office environment is really chill.

But the thing is, I've hated law from day one of university. I never had any interest in the subject and still do not. I also kind of hated being in the UK for those 5 years, mainly due to the circumstances. The fact that I had to study law, more or less against my will has made me really hate law and myself. I feel like a prisoner in my own life.

I realize that I really need to change my career, but I'm at a complete loss as to what I should do. I have zero adult guidance now, and I was raised such a sheltered life (eg: not allowed to play sports outside, because I would get kidnapped...wtf right?) that I am completely confused about my life.

I do not want to do this law shit any longer. I just want to quit so bad. But I have no idea what I can do alternatively. I am really hesitant to quit this job, because of all the goods things about it I said before. I am worried that quitting is going to be a really big mistake. But this is definitely not the life I want to live.

My years of depression as completely sucked the life out of me. I don't have the energy to study again, mainly because university was a form prolonged mental torture for me. And mainly because I would need to save a lot of money to put me through uni, which I cannot do without a salary.

I also feel like a bitch complaining about my life because I am well provided for. I live in a nice house, I am fed, and loved. But I am extremely unhappy and have been so for the last 6 years. I really really hate myself for not standing up for myself. I know that this is all my fault. I was too scared to just quit law school, mainly because so much money was spent behind me. And the social pressure from back home for me to finish school was immense. I wish I was more mature and not a little shit who just followed the path of least resistance. But now I am trying to correct my stupid mistakes.

I've thought of teaching law, but teachers aren't really paid anything in this country, and I hate talking in public (also another reason I do not want to be a lawyer).

Though about working in the legal division in a company, but I have to wait till February 2013 because I have to sit for a national exam first for me to be employable in any kind of decent job.

I apologise for the wall to text and poor writing, but language is not my strength (another reason I hate law). . I do not really have anyone who's an adult to talk to about this. Most of my friends are still students, so they don't know anything, just like me. My head has been a mess for the last month and I can tell I'm burning out after all this time. Every night all I fantasize about is suicide, only to wake up to another 10 hours of work which I hate. But I could please use some advise on what I can do career wise and what I should want from my life (right now I just want to die).

What I am most worried about is making the wrong decision out of fear (which is partly how I got into my current mess). I do not want to wait 1 more year to realize that the last 7 years of my life has been a big mistake (I'm pretty sure it has).

I literally have no idea what to do with my life anymore. And I also do not feel like I am able to make any rational and objective decision about my long term goals. Mainly because I have been sheltered and kept away from a lot of things, so I'm quite immature, naive and don't yet understand how real life works. And since I don't have any adult to talk to about these things, I feel like I'm completely in the dark.

Should I do something else (but what?), or should I stop being a whiny bitch and just suck it up and work at my law firm (since any one to gets to work there is extremely lucky)? Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

I've been meaning to branch out from HTML/CSS and thought learning PHP would be a breeze ... that being said, I can't even seem to get off the ground.

I use my new macbook for everything work-related as it's better than the computers they have here on site. I managed to [set up](http://macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2001/12/07/apache.html) my Apache server (easy) but can't seem to figure out how to download / install [Symfony], [let alone PHP](http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.macosx.bundled.php).

I guess my questions are:

* HOW CAN I PREP MY MAC FOR WORKING IN PHP?
* WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL SYMFONY?

I've been reading the directions online, but I think I need them explained in slightly less *jargony* terms. If anyone has the time to hold my hand and help me get off the ground, it'd mean a lot.

z6syb,8,2012-09-01,Potentially stupid question from a n00b... but how did you guys get research opportunities?,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/z6syb/potentially_stupid_question_from_a_n00b_but_how/,"As a sophomore, I've already gotten an internship, networked well enough to wriggle my way into a clinical volunteer position in the ER department of a local hospital, and am heavily involved in two other student organizations that I hope to gain leadership positions in soon...

but finding a research position is stumping me. Did you just approach faculty members and ask them if you could do research with them? I probably won't start doing this until next year, but I'm spreading out my undergrad over five years, so I can still gain three years of solid research experience this way. I'd be spreading myself too thin doing an internship and research all at once, anyway, because I work, too."
z6reu,2,2012-09-01,Relaxing At Last,[deleted],bbw_erotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/bbw_erotica/comments/z6reu/relaxing_at_last/,"I suppose the hardest part of my day was the end of it.  Not the work that I had to do, but to leave it all behind at the office and just relax.  I had never been one to sit and do nothing, but this new internship had been draining every ounce of my energy from day one.  I was out the door before six in the morning and home sometimes after midnight.  I had no time for a social life, and even when I did get time off, I was so exhausted I slept.

It had been yet another killer week at the office and I was just slipping my shoes off when the phone ring.  I knew it was work because having just moved here they were the only ones who had the number to my condo.

I answered and listened to the voice on the other end tell me that since I was low man on the totem pole and wanted the position so bad, I got to come in a cover the late shift at the office with only one other person there to help me.  Some woman named Elizabeth that I had never heard of.

I shook my head as I hung up the phone and drove all the way back to the office.  I suppose the lack of traffic should have given me a smile, but I was so tired I could care less about it.  I pulled into the deserted parking lot and walked into the office for twelve hours of monotony.

I walked into the Operations Center and sat down at my desk.  I saw a purse on the desk opposite me and was glad that at least the help I was promised was actually in the building, if not at her desk.

“Sir?”  The voice sounded as tired as mine and twice as exasperated.  “Sir, my name is Elizabeth and I guess we are partners for the evening.”

I dropped all the fatigue from my mind and turned around to say hello.  After all, a man without manners is not a man at all as my father would say.

I turned with a smile and sat there like an idiot as I saw her.  She was a probably about five feet, ten inches tall with raven black hair that cascaded down her back like a wave until it stopped just before her ankles.  Her lips were full, pouty and moist from the lipstick she wore.  Her eyes were the most beautiful shade of violet I had ever seen.

After a second of being rude, I introduced myself.

“Please, the name is Rick, my father is a Sir, not me.”  he had hoped for, and received a smile for the lame joke he had just told.  “I have never worked the night shift, what do we have to look forward to?”

Elizabeth smiled again, her tongue darting over her teeth before she spoke.  “I have worked night shift here for three years and have answered the phone twice in all that time.  I suppose that is why I am confused as to why you are here.  It isn't exactly busy.”

My anger was dissuaded by the melodic tone of her voice, it was so relaxing to listen to.  

“I assume it is because I am the new guy, or maybe they just don't like me.”  I smiled again and sat down in my chair, loosening my tie and cracking my knuckles.

She laughed then, a soft and sensuous sound that seemed to both echo and be directed at me at the same time.

“Well now, maybe it is me they don't like, sticking me with the new guy.”  Her voice held laughter in in and I noticed when she spoke she constantly moved her hands over the long red skirt she was wearing, constantly smoothing it over and over again.

I laughed loudly.  “Well, maybe it is a bit of both, please sit down and we can talk, seeing as we don't seem to have much work to do.”

She and I sat for hours and talked about a variety of things.  From the latest company gossip to where we liked to eat.  Inevitably, as most conversations tend to do, it somehow ended up at sex.  We spoke very candidly about what we liked and did not and she finally just stopped talking.

“I am so sorry, I shouldn't have been talking about that at all, it was inappropriate.”  My voice was angry, at myself, I knew better than to do stupid things like that at work.

She shook her head and smiled in a sad way.  “No, it is not that.  I work nights, I can't remember the last time I got....The last time I was with a man.  The club scene is not exactly pumping at noon.”

Before I could help myself my brain just launched.  “Really, an absolutely beautiful woman like you has no one to wrap their arms around when you get home?”

She looked at me and stood up, her arms spread.  “I am not one of those thin girls Rick.  I love myself, but that doesn't mean anything to the men I seem to be attracted to.”

I looked at her as she stood.  She was gorgeous.  She was a creature that I could stare at for hours.  She had full breasts that sat high on her chest, he didn't know bra sizes that well but they were bigger than any woman he had ever been with.  She had delicious curves at her hips and a stomach he could kiss for hours, it looked so soft and wonderful.  Her legs were thick and he imagined them wrapped around him.

I didn't talk as I stood.  I just stood an walked to her, her arms still at her side.  I moved towards her and hugged her.  Her arms, timid at first, wrapped around me as mine did her.  I felt the fullness of her, the perfection and I just couldn't help myself.  My erection grew rather quickly and she started as she felt the hardness of it against her.

“Sorry, it tends to do that when I am embracing a gorgeous woman.”  I could not apologize, how could I apologize for reacting to her?

“It's alright Rick, it's very nice.”  Her hands moved from around my shoulders and slowly slid down the front of me until they were in front of my crotch, she pressed softly into the pants and felt the length, unyielding under the material.

I swallowed a bit and ran my hands down her back, my fingers light on her skin as I touched her.  Her eyes closed and my hands moved slowly down and cupped her buttocks, my fingers pressing into the soft flesh, her soft moan telling me I was doing no wrong.

I moved the two of us forward, finally having her sit on the desk behind her as my hands continued to roam her body, now sliding down the nape of her neck and the tops of her breasts.  She whimpered as I touched them and I kissed the top of each of them lightly, my mouth landing like a butterfly on her skin.

I bent my knees and slowly moved down her body, my mouth kissing over the material of her clothes, my hands sliding down her thighs to her knees.  

I looked up at her and she nodded slightly, her face a mask of pleasure as I slowly spread her legs apart and ran my fingertips over her inner thigh.  She was wearing a black pair of panties, soft and silky and warm to the touch as my fingers found the center of her thighs.

She looked down at me, her breathing faster.  “Please, don't stop.”  I nodded and lifted her slightly, my fingers sliding under her buttocks and pulling the panties down her thighs quickly.  The musky heaven of her hit my nose and my mouth began to water.

I pulled her panties down farther and spread her legs until I could press my face into her core.  At first only smelling the heavenly scent, taking it all in as my eyes looked over her hairless mound and thick pink lips.

I kissed the lips ever so softly and felt her jerk under my ministrations.  Her hands went to my hair and ran through them softly.  I pressed my mouth fully onto their wonderful center and slid my tongue into her, tasting the dew that was forming and licking softly at the nub of flesh in it's center.  

Her hands were more incessant now, pressing my face into her.  I was more than happy to oblige and slid my tongue into her as far as I could make it go.  A moan and cry erupted above me and I began to slide my tongue into her quicker, tasting every corner of her sweet love.  My fingers ran up her legs and found the opening my tongue was still busily working.  I inserted a finger and she cried out, clenching my hair now as I softly fingered her while my tongue flicked the hard nub of her clitoris over and over again.  

I felt her start to shake and her moisture grow.  I knew it was coming and locked my mouth over her clitoris and pressed my finger to the core of her.  Her legs closed around my head, squeezing as a shriek erupted and her tightness grew evermore.  My mouth greedily drinking the fluids that now poured from her in a torrent.

After a moment her hands relaxed in my hair and her thighs relaxed their vice-like pressure.  I moved my head away and kissed each thigh softly before sitting on my feet and looking up at her, my sweet goddess.

She looked down at me with a smile and a look of mild euphoria.  “I will talk to Suzanne tomorrow and tell her we need more help at night.”

I smiled and told her that I would make breakfast if she would start the coffee in the morning.

z6pmu,1,2012-09-01,From cop to criminal [Bipolar/OCD] and hookers!,mhj123,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/z6pmu/from_cop_to_criminal_bipolarocd_and_hookers/,"Well I am not sure exactly how to begin this but perhaps that is simply the best intro there is. 

This is a throwaway account. Ever since I found out about this subreddit I have wanted to post, but over the years I have developed a very cynical outlook in regards to mental health. Per my own conditions I have never really found anything that has helped me and the years spent in therapy have made me feel jaded. I never truly trust my psychologist because I think they are all about the money (I know this isn't true). 

But I mean what a joke job, the guy sits there and listens to me moan for an hour and collects 150$ at the end. A hooker costs 50% less for a half hour and comes with a happy ending. 

When I was really little lets say 3 I was visiting my fathers mother in NY (my grandfather died before I could meet him). Anyway to make a long story short I was playing with my dad in the park and started freaking out about 'germs' being all over me. I have no recollection of this incident but based on my fathers description it definitely sounds like I was having some sort of a panic attack. 

Anyway shortly after that my pre-school teachers started telling my parents that I spent an abnormal amount of time in the bathroom and when they asked me why I apparently told them it was because I was washing my hand. And indeed I was washing my hands, until they bled. 

So that led to the first encounter with a psychatrist. I got diagnosed with OCD and thrown on Prozac or Zoloft for kids, anyway my mom used to sprinkle it onto my applesauce. 

Now usually I get this far in my story and just delete it because who wants to hear me this drama. But I am going to push forward because for some reason. Mainly because I am high as shit. In fact I need a cigarette I will brb.

Ok I am back. Where were we? Hand washing. Oh yes I definitely did that. I was terrified of germs and especially the thought of them being on my toys. In addition to this my grandmother (same one I was visiting in NY past away). Ever since that moment I have also been obsessed with death and dying.....

Even now just writing that part tears swell in my eyes. She was my best friend. Every time she came to visit I got spoiled rotten and I loved every second of it. She made me feel like I was a prince or someone very special. If there was a toy I wanted she bought it! We used to always go to the toy store when she would visit (Toy's R Us). 

Even though I was only a child when she passed away I can recall the exact moment when my father told me she was gone. I was playing a formula one racing game and my dad was behind me sitting on the couch watching. I got like 3rd place or some shit and I was pumped up  being like 4 years old. My dad was pumping me up as well and then he told me to sit on the couch because he needed to talk to me. 

I instantly was stricken with fear. God that fear. He looked me in the eyes and we both began crying at the same time. He explained to me that she passed away from an aneurysm in her brain. 

After I learned about what it felt like to lose a loved one my mind fixated on death and especially on my mother as she is to this day the person I feel closest with. I began having panic attacks at night, unable to sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about what happens when we die? Would I never see my mother again?

So blah blah blah I have seen therapist all my life...... Always on medication even in middle/high school I was on something like;

Valium
Generic SSRI
Ambien

Funny thing was I was a straight edge kid all the way up until the time I killed myself at age 24. Smoked weed like twice once at age 15 and once at age 22. 

I was like that because I wanted to be a fighter pilot as a child. Watched too much Top Gun and my dad is a commercial pilot. Some psychologist told me once that 80% of pilots exhibit symptoms of hypo-mania, fun fact. I quickly realized that my vision was way to shitty to be a pilot. So then I changed my mind to becoming an FBI agent when I was like 13. 

^This later turned out to be a REALLY dumb ass idea because while I loved the investigative side of things there is no way in hell I was going to be able to handle the anxiety ridden anarchy of patrol duty.

So yeah once I got to college things began to settle. I partied (drank) and developed ulcerative colitis. I was living with my buddies and wasting my life on WoW. I was fat as hell but I got in shape while in college. Never got laid and always felt like a loser because of it lawl. 

I did well in college graduated with a 3.3/3.5 gpa or some shit. I did get a 4.0 my last two semesters which was cool because it put me on the dean's list of scholars. I also did a pretty cool law enforcement internship. 

After I graduated I started applying for all federal law enforcement jobs I could find. I didn't want to work for a local agency and the fact that in my state you have to self sponsor yourself through the academy (without the guarantee of a job after graduation) continued to deter my interest in local departments.

Eventually I got an interview with the Secret Service and since I don't want the feds up my ass I am just going to leave that process as classified. I failed the polygraph because I couldn't sleep for two days before it and my anxiety was off the charts. They offered to re-test me but I knew if I couldn't handle the stress of that stupid test. Which indeed I was 100% truthful on then what right did I have to protect the PoTUS. 

My fellow officers couldn't count on someone like me. 

This sense of failure drove me into a great depression.... I moved back home and dwelled in my old room spending my unemployed days playing league of legends and as luck would have it, World of Warcraft. 

I was working at UPS as a seasonal helper and basically felt so lost like such a failure that I lined up all my medications and then I took my 1911 out of the case pulled a round out of a clip and said to my self:

""I can keep taking these medications for the rest of my life or I can take this one bullet and be free forever"" 

I couldn't stop thinking about my mom at my funeral so that stopped me. But during all this time my sister's drug habit had revealed its ugly head. 

I knew in college that she had gotten into my moms meds a few times but one time when I was in her room helping my mom look for drugs I found the key to my moms safe in my sisters pillow case. 

We then found out about her roxycodone addiction and that she had been stealing stuff from our house left and right and pawning it at local pawn shops. 

Shit the bitch stole and pawned my mothers 25 year anniversary ring.

Eventually my sister stole my Alienware laptop which had a bunch of classified files on with regard to the internship I did in college, as well as all of my school work/resumes etc.... etc........

Angry beyond belief I stormed down the stairs with a knife and when my mom stopped me hypothetically someone yelled ""Tell me why I shouldn't slit that bitch from ear to ear"". 

I love my sister. I swore an oath on the day she was born to protect her. I swore from that day that I would give my life for her. Then she became a monster.

I got in the car drove to the parking lot of where I had been working at the time and tried to settle down. I was so tired I just wanted to go to sleep, but I was soooooo pissed off that I couldn't.

I took my Xanax, Lunesta, Lamictal drank a little bottle of absinthe and started drinking hydromet syrup until I passed out. I knew I was at the risk of over dosing but I didn't care. I even wrote a note that said ""If found dead, this wasn't a suicide I just wanted to sleep"". Somehow I ended up finding an 'escort' online and making a visit to her hotel room. 

Something I have done since which I am way not proud of. Not with the same one even. Massage parlors, erotic hair cuts. I have done some fucked up shit. 

Shit this has been a long winded rant and I really don't feel like writing anymore. 

Anyway I started experimenting with spice about 1.5 years ago and had a bad panic attack. Started smoking regular trees to help with my anxiety. It really has helped.... in some ways or is that just the drugs talking? Who knows.......

Anyway I have a few different personas I use when I visit these escorts as well. 

AMA if you want, idgaf.

Oh and I tried to become a mental health counselor to try and help people like me but the grad school basically told me I was too crazy to help the crazy people."
z6jqu,1,2012-09-01,Totally cracked out girl in my apartment. I have no idea what to do with her. Please help.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6jqu/totally_cracked_out_girl_in_my_apartment_i_have/,"Sorry if this isn't exactly the correct subreddit for this, but it seemed like the past chance at getting a response quickly. Reddit knows everything. So, yesterday I'm meeting my buddy on campus. Says he's hanging out with some girl and to find him. I get there and there is this sort of jittery girl of 24 years hanging out with him (whom he just met). She seems friendly and highly intelligent. Says she's here to scope out an internship program at the hospital and is planning to apply for a PhD in biochemistry. Drinking coffee. The three of us meet up with another female friend and go eat Chinese food at the beach. She's slamming successive energy drinks. She bails as soon as we get there and says somebody is coming to get her. We don't see anyone, but she leaves anyway.

A few hours later she calls us and wants to know what we're up to. My friend said something about hanging earlier. Except now my friend suddenly has to bail to go take care of his sick sister, and the other girl had to go for some other reason. So suddenly I'm all alone with this girl, and she explains that she needs me to drive her to go get a key from some guy whose lettering her stay in his place. I spend an hour and half waiting in a parking lot behind Dunkin Donuts. She walks off because she says she has to meet him behind 711. I wait where I am. I get a call from some thug sounding guy who asks if she has his money (she used my cell phone to call him). I want to get in my car and drive, but her purse is in my car. She comes back says she couldn't find him. FYI, I think she wanted painkillers because she mentioned she needed those later for her pains that were a result of some fall down a stairs.

So obviously she was trying to do some kind of drug deal and it fell through. So now that she can't stay at his place (couldn't meet him for the key, as was the original story), she asks if we can hang out in this hookah bar for a bit while she calls some friends and finds a place she can crash. She tries to no avail. Also, she's slamming these energy packet things. As sketchy as this all sounds, she doesn't seem like a bad person. Highly, highly intelligent.. probably gifted, which engenders some sympathy with me. Well, now it's almost midnight and she has nowhere to go and I'm getting tired. I say she can sleep at my place, and I can give her some Valium to help her sleep. I hid away all the little things with value just to be sure, and she doesn't seem interested in robbing or harming me. Just trying to offer her a hot shower and a couch or bed (I take the other) to sleep it off. Well she didn't sleep at all, and was just pottering about all night. I'm seeing some evidence of OCD or something because my bathroom is all organized (first with my stuff alone, now with all of her stuff). She spent most of the night in there, I suppose because she didn't want to disturb me with the light on. See, she doesn't seem like a bad person. Anyway, it's morning now and I come down stairs to find my can of ground coffee open and empty. I think she was eating it with a spoon or something. So I need to start my day soon and she still has nowhere to go. Apparently she lives about 40 minutes from here at her parents house, but they're on vacation and won't be back until the following day. This means I have to do something with her. And also I'd prefer she doesn't die and stuff. I checked her pulse and it was pretty fast. Not like running from a T-rex fast, but definitely a great deal higher than I would like mine at 7am. 

So my questions are 1) WTF is going on with this girl? 2) Why is she consuming so much caffeine? and 3) How to I get myself out of this situation? 

FYI. I did not have sex with her, try to have sex with her, or anything like like that."

z6aep,0,2012-09-01,Have I screwed myself over?,[deleted],law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/z6aep/have_i_screwed_myself_over/,"Cross-post from r/lawschool--I thought I might be able to get more concrete feedback here as many of you are practicing attorneys.

To make a long story short-ish, I know with absolute certainty that I want to practice criminal law. That said, I have been unsure, and I still am, about which side I want to go into. Thus, I've tried both and am concerned about how that will affect my ability to obtain employment.

I worked as a student attorney for the public defender's office, and I loved it. I handled rape and child molestation cases, so I know that being a zealous advocate is not really going to be a problem for me. I'm also about to be published in Law Review on a pro-defendant topic related to juvenile law and statutory rape.

I'm currently a student attorney for the DA's office and I like it as well, though I haven't been there long. I think both sides are important and interesting, and to be honest, I didn't want to pigeonhole myself into a particular sector and make my career rest on one or two job applications.

However, now I'm concerned that I'm not going to be hired by either, because employers will think I won't be as capable or excited to do my job. I was wondering if Reddit could weigh in, and maybe suggest some ways I can try to minimize the damage as hiring processes begin. 

I'm also trying to figure out what I should do for the spring--whether I should stick with the DAs office, go back to the PDs office or just become neutral and get a judicial internship. If there are any suggestions in that regard as well, I would be grateful.

z684k,24,2012-09-01,First time I've ever got rejected from a job for being overqualified.,BaoBaoPocket,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z684k/first_time_ive_ever_got_rejected_from_a_job_for/,"After graduating college in May, I've kind of had it rough. The job market here is really tough and not to mention xenophobic. I got a bachelor's degree in social sciences and started out applying to Marketing &amp; Sales positions for hotel chains. I got to the fourth interview with a very well-known company, and they denied me sending me a letter in the mail. 

Fair enough, let's lower some standards and try to work my way up the corporate ladder. Tried applying to lesser-known hotels, who have yet to even meet with me or even talk with me over the phone. So hotels we're a bust, but banks are always hiring! I applied to five different banks. One of the banks I applied to 6 different teller positions. Resume decorated nicely with my new degree, ""I'm a shoe in"" says my parents.

Received an email from them a week after applying saying ""Position filled, sorry."" I called their corporate HR office and spoke with a recruiter about this. It was incredibly disheartening hearing her over the phone tell me to just keep applying to jobs because the way their system works is they have to open the job on their website, even if they want to hire from within. Essentially, they had no intention of hiring/interviewing me.

Finally, I go to a different bank's job fair. I met with their VP of HR and she was amazing! She was super friendly and complimented my application a lot. She says, ""You do realize that the Teller position only makes about $10/hour, right?"" I explained to her that I understood and I feel that this is a perfect opportunity for me to understand how banks work from the front to the end, as I plan to invest myself into this career if they will invest in me. She was impressed (or so she says) and shoots me off to the interview.

Met with the branch manager and services manager in a blue collar neck of the woods, which happened to be hiring for a full time teller position. They were both very fun and welcoming. I thought to myself that I could learn a lot from them. Interview went pretty well, and I followed up with HR twice since. 

Today, I called to see how my application was going and was told that they were concerned that I was overqualified and would get bored working for a bank making that little money. I tried to reassure them that I don't feel overqualified and no matter what I'll be doing for the bank I will embrace the opportunity to learn! HR then said that they really like my application, so they're not going to hire me.... there... what. So I'm going off to interview for the same job at a different branch with more white collar customers.

God dammit. /r/jobs I know you veteran job-seekers have months and possibly years on me, but this is already getting tiring. I'll be making around $20k with a bachelor's degree if I get this job, and it's hard enough getting it! I know it will take time to move up in the company, but all the meanwhile my colleagues are getting internships that pay way more than that, continuing their education, or getting paid to work with Engineering degrees for $60-65k starting.

I feel like I pigeon-holed myself with this degree and I can't afford to go back to college. If I didn't have my grandfather's trust fund, I would be in deeper shit and be ridden in student debt. God. dammit. Anyway /r/jobs, any advice for me?

TL;DR - Graduated in May, have been applying and getting denied to jobs since. Today was the first time I got denied for being overqualified from a teller position at a bank. Anyone advice would be appreciated!

Thanks for reading, sorry the post was incredibly long. I need to rant."

I couldn't think of a better job for myself; I would love to dress up and work as a princess at the park because I love working with little kids and the public. 

1. Is it worth it, working there? (I'm asking everyone who works there, not just the people who work with costumes)
2. Is it hard? I've heard you have to ALWAYS stay in character 
3. Was it easy or difficult to get the job?
4. Do you need any special training to become a person who works with the attractions, I read that you need to audition for a role with a costume. 
5. Is the pay good?
6. Is it worth leaving college to do the internship? (I went into college undecided)
7. Sort of the same question as number 1, but is it fun? Is that job something that you would be proud to talk about?

Thanks for your input!!!
(I would want to audition for the role as Ariel!)"

I'm also a Information Technology/ Finance major so that is something that sets me apart. But anyway I would love to hear how you like working in Advising and what kind of projects you work on. If you work for the Big 4 that is definitely a plus.  Thanks for your insight. "

I may be able to help!

I am a Microsoft Software Development Engineer (SDE) and have been with the company for several years. In that time, I've recruited at several Universities, attended Career Fairs, and interviewed candidates flown in to our main campus in Redmond, WA.

While I won't violate my NDA, I can share a decent amount about your possible interview experience, and I can offer tips for getting the job.

Any advice I give, while tailored to Microsoft, is extremely similar to what you'll hear for other large companies such as Google, Amazon, and Apple (among others).

So, if you've got a question, fire away

**DISCLAIMER:** My responses in this post as well as the comments are not official statements on behalf of Microsoft. They are my own thoughts and insights gathered through my experiences, they don't reflect an official company position.

z8t7o,1,2012-09-02,Can someone explain to me financial and political ethics in Islam?,[deleted],islam,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/z8t7o/can_someone_explain_to_me_financial_and_political/,"This is kind of a complicated and loaded question, so I'll try my best to explain myself.

I know that Islam is a pro-profit and pro-capitalism to a certain extent -- meaning that it's encouraged make a profit and run a successful (and permissible) business while following certain rules.  I know buying certain things made out of gold (for men at least) isn't allowed -- such as jewelry, dishes, Saddam Hussein's infamous gold toilet, etc.  I think this can be interpreted in modern times as to not flaunting your wealth (for example, a muslim rapper buying a platinum grille is probably breaking some rules).

I also know that investing privately in a company or publicly on the stock market with the hopes of profiting from the company is also allowed.  You're putting money into a company and hoping that in 10 or 20 years it increases your wealth.  However, I'm sure trading (which isn't investing) isn't allowed because it's speculative and essentially gambling.  I also know shorting isn't allowed because when you short a stock you need to pay interest and you're hoping the company/stock market does bad.

However, what about things like corporate espionage, poaching employees from a rival company, sending out false information, insider trading, etc -- what are Islam's views about these?

Now onto the political side of the question.  I'm American so I'm asking from the perspective of a democratic republic -- I don't want this to turn into a discussion of what system-of-government Islam favors the most.  In any case, I'll assume it's okay for muslims to run for office, campaign, be involved in the political process.  

But what about the shadier side of politics -- what's the Islamic view on that?  Is it okay to run attack ads, manipulate laws/districts to get votes, play dirty with rivals, etc?  

Hell, is it okay in Islam if I'm a lobbyist for let's say the energy industry and I'm going to offer a senator a job in the industry if he/she passes laws that benefit the energy industry?  From the Islamic perspective, is that different than promising a job to an exceptional student who works for a company as an intern?  I'd think Islam would encourage a business to go after the brightest minds to strengthen that business, but would Islam encourage going after the most powerful politicians to strengthen an industry?

I know these are complicated, but I think this is more interesting to discuss rather than the usual crap on here.  It's funny, because I'm muslim, though not religious at all (so am I technically a muslim?), but I'd still like to know how Islam feels about these things.

Thanks in advance, and sorry for the wall-o-text!"

z8lwz,8,2012-09-02,What stuff would help me stay sane and move to the States for a master's degree eventually?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z8lwz/what_stuff_would_help_me_stay_sane_and_move_to/,"I'm a CS student in India - just started college last month. I eventually want to move out of India. I'd like some general advice with building up a good résumé over the next four years. 

I realise how important a summer internship is - unfortunately, my uni only gives us 15 days vacation between semesters, assuming I can even FIND an internship. I'm very depressed with the system, which seems more focused on making code monkeys rather than people who can actually think. What is some useful and INTERESTING stuff I can work on, parallel with getting my degree? (I AM very interested in CS, I love programming - unlike maybe 70% of my class). Also, what sort of stuff do American universities look at? I'd like to keep tuition costs to a minimum, get a few scholarships if possible.

This probably sounds like more of a rant than anything, and I sound like a stereotypical douchey college kid with an overblown superiority complex - but I'm really frustrated and depressed, seeing so many thousands of people - including my best friends - get into streams they hate (read: engineering/CS), just for the promise of a nice job and an arranged marriage 10 years down the line. And nobody CARES about anything - not the students, not the professors, not the companies, nobody has any passion. The system is more focused on giving marks to the students who mug up the most - but then again, that's one of the hallowed traditions of Indian education."

z8hf8,1,2012-09-02,[25M/22F] Possible future or waste of my time?,butthurtexbf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z8hf8/25m22f_possible_future_or_waste_of_my_time/,"Throwaway here. Me[25/m] I apologize this is gonna be a long one but i really need some advice. I graduated from college a few years ago and during that time I had a ,for the most part, awesome relationship with a girl i have known for almost ten years. We had an instant connection when we met as young teens, and when we wound up going to the same college together things blossomed in ways i have never experienced with another person. We dated for about 2 years, we had our issues like every other couple, but for the most part things where good.I worked at one of the few popular bars in town and oftentimes would grab a drink with coworkers after work. At the end of my senior year i drunkenly went to a co-workers house (who is a known lesbian and i had no intentions with her) to try to sober up a bit as she lived right nextdoor to the bar. Honestly the details are vague but i ended up hooking up with her that night, that much i remember. After realizing what i had done, I couldnt come to terms with it, was afraid to tell her, and decided to break up with her without ever mentioning what happened, and basically used our impending separation after grad. and me wanting to find myself as an excuse. 

Fast forward a year, im living in our hometown, she has a semester to go and doing an internship somewhere else in the state. We run into eachother randomly during this summer, agree to meetup later on, sparks flew old feelings were dug up, and all i wanted was her. Weeks pass and i see the direction things are going and she is reciprocating those feelings but i knew i could never be with her again unless i came clean. I confessed what happened, of course she was hurt, I gave her a little bit of space but things didnt change drastically or so i thought. Our birthdays pass we get each other gifts, i actually invited her around my family for mine, a few i love you's where exchanged over the course of a few months. 

I let her stay at my place while i was away on vacation, by the time i come home she has returned to her internship.My laptop battery is shitty and takes less than an hour to die. When i plug it in and turn it on her fb is logged in and i see a message from a guy i noticed earlier that has been blowing her up lately on fb. Turns out hes a guy she had hooked up with during the year we were not together and she has been flirting with him, and saw that he had asked her if he liked the pic he sent her etc. , this was a few days prior to my bday and weeks after hers. Im hurt i ask her about it she says its just flirting, she likes the attention, we arent together right now, etc. 

So i was cool with it, tried to not let it get in the way of what I thought we where building, even though we def had a few arguments about the guy. Even though we established we werent going to commit to one another it still hurt to know i wasnt the only guy she was talking to. He lives in our old college town in which she has one semester left. So my thinking is as soon as she goes there its gonna be on with the two of them. She insists its not like that, and spends every night with me in the 5 days leading up to her going back. I notice she is being standoffish her last day or so in town, something was up for sure. so i  check her phone to night before she leaves while she is asleep in my bed and see she has been sexting this guy all day and planning to hookup with him the following night. So i wake her up, ask her what her deal is, and basically ask her to leave without telling her i saw the messages. Not knowing ive seen the messages she goes on this rant about how im assuming too much, and making her out to be a bad guy, and that it's not like that with him. As she is leaving  i throw a few things i read in her face, letting her know i saw it all. She was shocked disgusted angry, we have a text argument the next day and now we arent speaking. 

I guess you could say she got her revenge, im not sure if there was a definite motive there. And because of my previous infidelity i guess i am not allowed to feel any certain way about it. I know i broke her heart when we broke up before, and after the fiasco this summer with me being a nosey asshole she said she doesnt know if she can trust me again. I dont blame her, but it is all i can think about. I love her so much and have always seen her in my future. We havent spoken in weeks. My question is, Do you all think too much has transpired and i should move on? I really do love her, and i want to fix it, im leaving her alone to give her some space, but i honestly have hopes for the future as foolish as that may or may not sound.

tl;dr reunited with past love, I disrepected her privacy, saw how things actually where, not speaking at this point. What do?

I started ""eating healthier"" around the end of April. I'm guessing I was 310+ at that point. After poking around /r/loseit, I found a link to /r/keto and decided to give that a try (start date: May 2). I went home from college about a week into May, finally got my scale on May 11 and officially weighed in at 301.6. Today's weigh-in: 251.2!

I don't really go out of my way to exercise, mainly because I'm too lazy and am still nervous about being the fat guy at the gym :P

I do, however, walk quite a bit (since I'm on a college campus) and I had an internship over the summer where I was on my feet for a large part of the day and consistently registered around 10k steps a day (according to my fitbit). 

For my diet, I stick mainly keto, though I don't limit myself from a dessert or drink here or there and try to stick to around 1500-1600 kcal a day. I've been averaging about .44 lbs/day lost, so I think it's working for me :)

So this might be long but I really need to get it off my chest. I have been dating my girlfriend for over 2 years now. She is in the grade below me, but our birthdays are only a couple months apart. Our relationship moved really fast from the get go, saying ""I love you,"" less than a month of dating. To me, she is the only love I know and I really do love her.

The problem here is that we are young. She talks about how she wants us to last forever all the time and at times it freaks me out. I usually just shrug it off and play along. A couple of nights ago, I talked to her about how I wanted to intern in a different state this summer, and all she kept asking is what about us? It was extremely hard to talk about, but I told her that we are young and that we will figure things out when they arise. She didn't like that answer, but I had to get it off my chest. From there we fought for a little about the topic, but I left for college the next day and changed the subject. It's all that has been on my mind lately, she is a freshman in college this year coming up to the same school I am at next semester.

She also holds it over my head how we lost our virginity together. I understand that it is a huge deal, but I truly love her. But, I have come to the realization that we are young and the chances that we last forever are slim. Unfortunately she will not live with that, she constantly talks about how her mom and dad were the only people they dated and got married.

I feel trapped. Please help me out. I don't know what to do or say. I tried to talk to her, but she will just take it as breaking up, and I don't know what to even say anymore. It has started to really stress me out and I don't want to her lose her. Unfortunately the thought of thinking we are going to last forever scares me. I have only dated her.

tl;dr: 18 m, in a relationship for 2 years with 18 f, feels trapped and scared for future. Please help!"

[How common is defecating during childbirth?  Is it 100% of the time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c6212jd?context=5)|No, it is not 100% of the time.  If your bowel is full, you may push stool out as well as a baby.  It is NO BIG DEAL and we handle it discreetly. If you thing you are in labor, try a light diet while at home.  Most of all, prevent constipation by drinking enough water and eating fruits, vegetables and whole grains - it will keep you regular and minimize the chance of having to push out a giant load.
[Thank you so much for answering this.  I've always been nervous about this and it was embarrassing to talk about :/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c622os6?context=5)|No problem!  Hope I put your mind at ease.
[Thanks for doing this AMA. Being a L&amp;D nurse is on my list of things I want to be when I ""grow up"" (or rather when my kids grow up, lol!\). What a wonderful job you have, helping babies come into the world and being there for women and their families on the most important day for them.  How do you nurses typically view natural births? Do you guys mind following written birth plans as best as you can? I have heard horror stories of mean nurses because the moms want to be up and moving/change positions during labor, and the nurses were bitchy with them because they wouldn't ""be good"" and just stay put in bed. Any truth to that? I'm hoping to have a natural birth in October, but I'm so nervous about having mean nurses! (I had great nurses with my first birth, but it was an induction with an epidural, so maybe they were so nice because I was a ""good"" patient.\)  And a personal question, just curious on your professional opinion. ;\) I had a 3rd degree tear with my first, and my dr is trying to push me to induce early with this one so I can avoid having a bad tear again. I am hesitant, especially since I wanted to do things naturally this time, and size of the baby isn't a medically necessary reason to induce. Do women who have had bad tears in previous births tear again? What about medicated vs natural births - have you seen any difference between the two and the occurrence of tears? I was hoping that if I was unmedicated, that I could feel things and have more control over pushing and avoid tearing (at least not as bad\), but maybe I'm doomed to tear again no matter what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c624bln?context=5)|Natural births and birth plans are fine, as long as the woman is flexible in terms of changes to her plan when medically advised and necessary.  We have to follow standards of care (these are universal) such as listening to a fetal heart rate every X minutes during different phases of labor, assessing contractions, ruptured membranes, etc.  Where birth plans become an issue for nurses is when there is an obvious obstetrical reason for doing something not on the plan and the patient sticks to her plan against medical advice.  For example, maybe she doesn't want an IV, but we have to do this to give antibiotics for Group B strep if you're in labor or your water breaks. Or won't allow us to monitor the baby according to practice standards, or refuses the Vitamin K shot for her infant because she read something on the internet.
[How often do you really see complications from inductions or epidurals that lead to c-sections? The statistics on the internet and in natural birthing books make it sound scarily high, but are they true or are they more scare tactics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c624bln?context=5)|Complications from inductions - same as regular labor, if done correctly - either you dilate or you don't, either the baby fits or it doesn't.  If there is fetal distress, you need a c-section.  If the baby doesn't fit, same deal. No dilation, no vaginal delivery.  Epidurals - very rare for complications.  I've seen a couple in thousands, and none were a deal-breaker as far as I'm concerned.  Not life threatening. Just inconvenient.
 |Only your personal doctor knows what to recommend regarding the size, risk of tears, etc.  You pay/hire your doctor for his/her advice.  You need to trust the opinion and follow it or find somebody you do trust.
[I know you were doing your job but I felt like it was a huge annoyance. When the induction was taking place it wasnt bad but being hooked up to all those monitors was the last thing I wanted. Being touched at all during my labor was irritating. also is it common to Puke during delivery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c625gk7?context=5)|Puking is common.  All energy is diverted to the uterus, a very large muscle doing a lot of work in labor.  The GI tract kind of shuts down.. so what goes in, stops there, and comes back up.  
[What percent of the births that you attend are inductions or start off as inductions?  I birthed both of my children at home attended by CRNs. It was a very good experience for me and I often wonder why OBs don't have homebirth practices. Having CRNs, I had the benefit of getting complete lab work done at their offices and I was able to have the IV fluids and antibiotics, oxygen tank (which wasnt needed but nice to have\), as well as an episiotomy and stitches for my first birth. If an OB was attending I think I would have asked for some sort of pain management during my first birth (my second was easy and relatively painless\).  Also, could you talk about what sort of pain management is available? I think a lot of women (me included\) are freaked out about the epidural but there must be less extreme treatments available as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c62709i?context=5)|I work in a ""high risk"" OB unit with a level III NICU, so we see disasters.  I know the risk is small for women screened for home birth. However, once you've worked in L &amp; D and seen even one case convert from low risk to BAD, you would never attend a home birth unless it was a precipitous delivery.
[Of the so-called ""natural"" births, what percentage ended up in an emergency?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c62709i?context=5)|I was taking care of a women in early labor.  No distress.  Then - wham - her placenta separated, and the FHR took a nose-dive.  We went from the labor room, down the hall with her on the bed, to the OR, emergency c-section and had the baby out in 90 seconds from labor room to birth time.
[Finally, what would you say to a first time mother that is terrified of the sort of information she has found on hospital births? While the knee jerk reaction is to groan about Google, the history of hospital births really is quite terrifying.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c62709i?context=5)|I think, what if that was my one-in-a-million case and my baby was in trouble?  Would I take even a tiny chance?  No.  In a home setting, you would not be able to save that baby.  I'm not saying it is wrong to do home birth, I'm just saying I wouldn't do it.  Maybe I've seen too much.  I understand fear of the epidural, but when the thought of hours of those contractions seems more than the fear, the epidural is asked for.
 |In my area, epidural is what we do - it doesn't go to the baby.  Any other pain medication, like oral or IV push meds, also medicate the baby and cause respiratory depression.
 |Can't give you those stats, 'cause I don't have them and won't make them up, and surely it varies amongst hospitals.
[I'm only 20 years old and don't plan on becoming pregnant any time soon, but childbirth sounds really scary and painful. If you could give me any piece of advice that I should always remember for when I have my kids, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c622bw6?context=5)|As for any piece of advice, I would say keep yourself healthy  and in good physical shape.  It does make a difference in how you tolerate labor.
[Thank you for your response! How often do women tear? Is there any way to reduce/prevent it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c624ilg?context=5)|Just sometimes, not always.
 |Best thing you can do is take care of yourself - eat right and exercise.  keep your tissue in good shape!
 |As for prevention in delivery, letting the baby descend and stretch the tissue naturally rather than forcing a push before the tissue has a chance to stretch can help.
[Are you nurses really as chipper as you come off? Just had my first son about three months ago and ours was sooo upbeat and supportive and overall just really great. We always wondered if she was just ""doing her job"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c621ejd?context=5)|We LOVE our jobs. Each and every birth is different... it isn't the same old story - no two are alike.  It is sooo fun.
[Do you work with any male rns? Are males really poorly received in your specialty? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c6231of?context=5)|I've worked with male nursing students, but there are no male staff nurses on my L &amp; D unit.  I think it is a logistical problem - all male docs need a female chaperone to check their patients.  If the nurse was male, he would need a female nurse to come with him every time he needed to do a procedure, delivery, or vaginal exam, or peri-care.
[That's intriguing. I think I understand where they're coming from, but why do they need to prevent male doctors/nurses from working alone with patients? If it's because of sexual assault concerns, wouldn't they also need to prevent lesbian nurses from being alone with patients? (even though that would open up a whole other can of worms\) Am I missing something completely? Is this standard in all L&amp;D units? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c62b88i?context=5)|No, your not missing anything and I can't disagree.  Just repeating what I hear from nursing management at all hospitals where I've been on the  L &amp; D unit.  Maybe it is just my area of the country (NJ, not far from NYC).
[I've read that some women experience orgasm during natural childbirth.  Have you ever witnessed this phenomena?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c621a18?context=5)|Who knows?  The sound of a person in pain, and the expressions on their faces, are very much the same as when experiencing pleasure.  If a woman does, good for her!  It shall remain her secret.
[My parents have always told me a story about my birth but I've always been skeptical of it. Here goes...  Supposedly when I was born my left leg, from the hip, was rotated 180 degrees. My mum said that as soon as I came out the nurse grabbed my leg, swung it back around so it was facing the right direction and then wrapped me up in a blanket. My mum also said that it took almost a year for my skin to...I don't know, realign itself? Any thoughts on this? Ever seen anything like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c621uz4?context=5)|Were you a breech presentation?
[Not that I know of.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c62auqi?context=5)|Reason I was asking:  babies coming butt first can have their little legs positioned straignt up with feet by the head.  I've seen this associated with dislocated hips (from the position)  and could be what you're talking about.
[Have you ever seen a father pass out from seeing the child birth? I've seen things like that happen on TV but don't know if there's any truth behind it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c6219su?context=5)|Yes, it happens.  Always prudent to keep an ammonia inhalant in my pocket just in case.
[What % of your patients have natural births?  What % do you estimate intend to, but end up getting med interventions during labor?  Any tips for avoiding a c-section?  What can a patient do to make your job easier?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c621b23?context=5)|Most of our patients have an epidural.  Few come with a natural birthing plan that excludes the option, at least in the large medical center I where I practice.  Pitocin is also used to augment labor.
 |Tips for avoiding a c-section:  choose a doctor who is patient, avoid large weight gain during pregnancy, be realistic, push HARD and listen to instructions.
 |Listen to what we have to say makes our job easier.  Your L &amp; D nurse is your best friend during this time.
[How much would you say an epidural helps? Is it a huge difference in the amount of pain the woman feels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c624k5l?context=5)|Yes.  Huge difference, especially if you have a low tolerance.  We respect those who choose not to have it, but why be in pain if you don't have to?
 |That said, some labors just don't hurt much.
[It has to be tough when things go wrong. Do you get emotional in these cases?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c621gpc?context=5)|Yes!  We cry along with the family.  It comes with the job, and some things you just can't leave and forget. It stays with me always.
[I wanted to become an L&amp;D nurse but I don't know if I could handle the bad. :( Nurses are AMAZING. I've never had a bad experience.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c62agn6?context=5)|There is good and bad with every nursing specialty.  You just have to remember the good (more of that).  The bad is really bad, but there is satisfaction (job and as a person) knowing you helped a family get through this difficult time.  They will always remember the kind of caring they receive in the bad times.  The good, normal outcomes forget you in flash.
[Have you seen the movie The Business of Being Born? What are your thoughts on births in American hospitals having a *much, much* higher mortality rate than any other developing country in the world? As well as Cesarians being done most commonly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c623ekb?context=5)|I have not seen the movie, but I will look for it and get back to you.
 |Re: the c-section rate - patients schedule their primary c-sections citing ""elective"" as the reason.  You can just have it if you want it, for whatever reason and you don't even have to say what it is.  Surely, this, and the repeat c-sections later, do much to increase our rates.
[How do you feel about doulas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c621l9y?context=5)|Fine with me, either way.  We each have a different role and it is important to respect that.
[What is your saddest delivery room experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c622knb?context=5)|Attending a delivery for fetal demise.  It is so sad.
[Can I ask what a fetal demise is, exactly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c623ggt?context=5)|When the baby has died and the mother has to deliver the dead infant.  VERY sad.
[My son passed away at 39 weeks gestation and I had to deliver him. I didn't think I could, but I did and am very glad. It brought immense closure and I'm so happy I got to see him and hold him.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c628g1o?context=5)|I'm so sorry for you and your family. :(
[Where did you go to school and how long did it take you from undergrad to completion? Do you mind sharing how much it cost? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c621qa1?context=5)|I went to school a very long time ago, so costs can't compare.  Since I was a business major in college, I was able to qualify for a ""second career scholarship"".  No tuition, just books and uniforms. I did a three year diploma school first and then an RN-BSN recently.
[Did you do your RN-BSN online and if so, where? Was it a good experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c62b4od?context=5)|Yes, good experience at www.tesc.edu.  It was hard, though, much harder than I expected.

People do much better if they know what to expect in their labor.
[I was adopted and I always wondered how hard it must have been for my birth mother.

[Hey there, I just wanted to say you guys are awesome!!! I'm planning on doing medicine, and still kinda tossing up the idea of midwifery/OB/GYN that whole dealio.  I was at the birth for two of my brothers (technically I was at the birth for my 3rd brother as well though I was 1 1/2 and obviously don't remember those. For the other two I was 17 and 19 respectively\) and for one of them I got to cut the cord. Something that I found very exciting at the time. The second child was record quick, we were at the hospital for a grand total of 8 minutes, and the whole labour lasted maybe 45 to an hour. It was hilarious, after my bro was born one of the midwives went to my stepmum and said 'I don't mean to be rude, but whats your name? Things happened so damn quick when you got in that I didn't get a chance to ask'.  Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks for what you do, and maybe one of these days I'll bump into you :\)  EDIT: I figured I should ask you a question, and it may seem a bit odd but would you say that Stillbirths or deaths related to complications during labour are worse? And how the hell do you handle something like 'Congratulations its a boy... who has downs syndrome' or something alone those lines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c6274bi?context=5)|It is all horrible.  The best thing we can do is give emotional support.  We have a great team all around (docs, nursery, NICU) that can help with support of complications.  Never easy for us, but surely easier for us that what the family is going through.
[This may seem like a silly question, but have you ever had a father deny paternity? The reason I ask is a friend of mine was doing a residency in an L&amp;D ward and the baby came out, shall we say, the wrong color and I wondered if he was bullshitting me or if this actually happens.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c624jw4?context=5)|It has happened. There are always dysfunctional couples around.
 |I'd be careful to jump to any conclusion, though, based on what the baby looked like at birth.  Also, I'd want to know the family history - might find out Grandma's side had a little something in the mix, and it is now just expressing that gene pool.
[Hi, I just moved back to my home state and received my insurance card earlier this week. I'm 39 weeks pregnant, in 3 days I will be 40 weeks. I am not sure if I should bother with looking for a doctor at this point and just wait for labor to come on (I have my records at hand of this pregnancy\). I've been dying to go to the hospital and see if I can get induced but I've been reading that if I'm not in labor and a doctor did not set me up to be induced, I cannot do that. However, can I be induced if I'm due already or a week overdue??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c628w1n?context=5)|If you just ""show up"" when you think you are in labor, you will get whatever doctor is covering ""service"" patients.  No choice.  You're better off picking your own instead of going with the crap shoot.
 |Also, at this time in your pregnancy you need somebody looking after you - blood pressure, etc.
 |Find a doctor asap.
[If you knew that a colleague (be it a doctor or nurse\) made a mistake during delivery that may have attributed to the death/serious injury of the mother or child, do you feel you'd be able to be honest about it in the event of a malpractice suit?  I have several friends who are are in nursing school and medical school, and they are all very cynical of malpractice suits, and I've heard that many practitioners would rather claim ""I don't recall"" in a deposition than admit that a colleague screwed up or not. And as a side note, how scary are lawsuits from the nursing standpoint?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c628jvj?context=5)|First, if there was an event, I would report it to my nurse-manager and elsewhere as indicated by protocol.  Good charting is our best defense. If it isn't written down, you didn't do it.

If you don't mind me asking though, what are your views of malpractice suits? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c62h88p?context=5)|Thankfully, I've never been close to one, so it is hard to have an opinion.  I imagine some are warranted, and others....well not.  Shit happens, and sometimes it is the luck of the draw and not something done wrong.  But (some) people want to capitalize on their misfortune.
[Why are women so afraid of an epidural?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z74wu/iamalabor_and_delivery_nurse_rn/c62cj0j?context=5)|There are ""walking"" epidurals available - no pain but not numb, and you can walk around with a portable fetal monitor.

I've been in the small business and startup world since before I can walk, it's something I know and totally love.

I'm in college, and do some social media work on the side for friends and this summer during my internship.  I like it a lot, and it fits in great with my degree, so I feel like getting some practical experience might fit into a job (or a lot more freelancing) later.  I've never really gotten paid for it, but with the amount of work they're asking me to do, it's time to start looking at $.  

Now, when his clients ask questions at social media and marketing, he shoots them to me.  These are folks that don't have a facebook page, a twitter account, still use @aol email addresses.  I swear one guy still had a hotmail account.

I know I'm no expert.  Most of this will be setting up pages and accounts for businesses, then either running them or teaching the businesses fundamentals.  It's also a great way to get some good solid recommendations for future business.

My questions are these.
1) How do you sell the real, practical value of your services up front to these kinds of clients?

2) What kind of contract should we be working out?

3) Should I push an evaluation and teaching them first, or lead straight in with offering to run their accounts?

4) How much should I charge for various levels of service?

5) I already have an online ""portfolio"" that links to my resume and everything me.  What other social media networks (other than Facebook and Twitter) should I focus on personally?"

So this might be long but I really need to get it off my chest. I have been dating my girlfriend for over 2 years now. She is in the grade below me, but our birthdays are only a couple months apart. Our relationship moved really fast from the get go, saying ""I love you,"" less than a month of dating. To me, she is the only love I know and I really do love her. 

The problem here is that we are young. She talks about how she wants us to last forever all the time and at times it freaks me out. I usually just shrug it off and play along. A couple of nights ago, I talked to her about how I wanted to intern at in a different state this summer, and all she kept asking is what about us? It was extremely hard to talk about, but I told her that we are young and that we will figure things out when they arise. She didn't like that answer, but I had to get it off my chest. From there we fought for a little about the topic, but I left for college the next day and changed the subject. It's all that has been on my mind lately, she is a freshman in college this year coming up to the same school I am at next semester. 

She also holds it over my head how we lost our virginity together. I understand that it is a huge deal, but I truly love her. But, I have come to the realization that we are young and the chances that we last forever are slim. Unfortunately she will not live with that, she constantly talks about how her mom and dad were the only people they dated and got married. 

I feel trapped, but I really do love her. Please help me out. I don't know what to do or say. I tried to talk to her, but she will just take it as breaking up, and I just don't know what to even say anymore. It has started to really stress me out and I don't want to her lose her. Unfortunately the thought of thinking we are going to last forever scares me. I have only dated her. 

tl;dr: 18 m, in a relationship for 2 years with 18 f, feels trapped and scared for future. Please help!"

Anyway i've been lucky enough to get an internship for 6 weeks in Japan. As some of you may know, you don't even think about getting drugs out here. If you get caught with even a gram its a long long time in jail. This has helped me ALOT. I haven't smoked for 2 weeks now, and i'm feeling positive about the next four.

Whenever that voice in the back of your head says 'man a joint would be great right now' the fact you know it's an impossible scenario makes getting over those thoughts a walk in the park.

I haven't found weed physically addictive, only mentally. Once you get over the hump of those first few nights, you start to realise you don't NEED it, it just suits your way of life at home. So here's my advice: If you can afford it go abroad and stay out there for as long as you can, it makes the whole process much easier.

Of course it's going to be hard when I get back home to keep it up, but keeping away from the stuff for a while puts things alot more in perspective.

Just my two cents. Keep up the good work guys!"

z7njk,0,2012-09-01,My Best Friend Committed Suicide 4 Months Ago Because of a Teacher AMAA,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z7njk/my_best_friend_committed_suicide_4_months_ago/,"Four months ago, my best friend committed suicide.

She had been pursuing her degree, and she was enrolled in an internship course. She was excellent on the internship, but the teacher would not pass her in this course because of 15 minute power point. She needed this class to get her degree, and could not afford to retake it because she had given up her job and used all of her savings to drive to the internship.
In efforts to fix the situation, my friend made one last attempt to reach out to the professor before going to the dean of the school. She sent an eloquent email stating the problems she had, and telling the teacher that if she did not pass her in this course, she felt like she had wasted that last few years of her life and all over a 15 minute power point presentation that had no expectations made by the teacher, only to show pictures and talk about what she had learned. 
Many other students have come forward and said they have had very similar problems with this professor.

The teacher wrote back with an email ranting that my friend was being immature, and had in fact been wasting the last two years of her life.

We believe it was at this moment my friend had felt as if all of her dreams had been ripped away from her, she was home alone, and had a access to a weapon. It was shortly after this email we believe she committed suicide. 

My friend was 20 years old. "

I couldn't think of a better job for myself; I would love to dress up and work as a princess at the park because I love working with little kids and the public.

1. Is it worth it, working there? (I'm asking everyone who works there, not just the people who work with costumes)
2. Is it hard? I've heard you have to ALWAYS stay in character
3. Was it easy or difficult to get the job?
4. Do you need any special training to become a person who works with the attractions, I read that you need to audition for a role with a costume.
5. Is the pay good?
6. Is it worth leaving college to do the internship? (I went into college undecided)
7. Sort of the same question as number 1, but is it fun? Is that job something that you would be proud to talk about?

Thanks for your input!!! (I would want to audition for the role as Ariel!)"
z7mlp,2,2012-09-01,I (F23) was able to say bye and it really helped!,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/z7mlp/i_f23_was_able_to_say_bye_and_it_really_helped/,"I broke up with my first boyfriend (24) at the beginning of the summer. We had dated for 6 months. We talked about breaking up and decided to stay together. Two days later I came back from a short vacation and he said that we should end it. Nothing really ""bad"" happened, we just weren't right for each other (I'm more emotional and he doesn't deal with emotions at all...and sex was not important to him as it was to me). 

We met as roommates and he was still in the house after the breakup, though he was physically gone all summer for an internship. When he came back, he moved his things slowly from the house into his new place. I texted him and asked if he wanted to get some pizza and catch up. He didn't respond.

I was pretty hurt since he did say he wanted to be friends. He told me that it wasn't just for me but he felt it was better for him to be friends with me too. So, it hurt to be ignored. But I know he is going through some things and it's probably difficult for him too since we hung out every day while we were together and we were both each others first relationships.

So, I was baking cookies for a coworker and left him some on his shelf. I wrote him a short note that said bye and that I wish him well on this last semester. He texted me later that day to thank me. It felt good to have that from him to know he appreciated it and that he didn't hate me...hard not to feel that way at times. So when I am tempted to say something to him I think of that and I feel comfortable with that being the last interaction we have."
z7lkx,4,2012-09-01,Feel really empty in new situations,alecbenzer,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/z7lkx/feel_really_empty_in_new_situations/,"Short history:

1. Be a bit depressed throughout high school
2. Go to college, things get worse (though in slightly different ways)
3. Start taking Prozac after a not-so-great first semester
4. Second semester much better

So after my second semester, I started working at as an intern. The job was ostensibly really awesome, and it was working for a cool company that I've always wanted to end up working for, but despite all of this, I felt sort of empty and sad at work a lot. I'd find myself almost on the verge of tears on my way home, and I was sometimes even borderline suicidal, not because anything was really all that wrong, but because I just didn't find much to enjoy.

After a while, though, things got better. I started to feel like I belonged more and the job, got a bit closer to some of the people, and began enjoying my work more. By the end, it was really fun, and in fact in the few weeks before I left the internship, I probably felt better about my general situation than I had for a long, long time. That being said, I was still looking forward to being back at school.

Then, I went back to school, and I feel like I'm feeling the same kinds of things I was at the beginning of my internship. Even though I'm around friends and taking classes I enjoy for the most part, I still feel that same kind of emptiness, and it's bothersome.

Does anyone else feel like this at times? What do you do to feel better?

[1\) Do you feel like the job makes you less scared of your own death?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|2) When picking up a body, ""We'll take good care of him/her"" I try to stay away from, ""He's in a better place now."" I don't believe in heaven so I just feel weird saying it.
[2\) Are there sort of catch-phrases that you use to comfort people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|3) I was always curious about it in High School and when I graduated I just went to school for it on a whim. The more I learned the more I liked it.
[3\) What got you interested in the job? Anything that you really like about the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|3.5) Being able to help people in what's probably the worst moments of their lives. Whenever someone comes up to me with tears in their eyes and hugs me and shakes my hand thanking me for giving them closure...it really does feel good.
[4\) Were you squeamish at first, or can you still be sometimes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|4) At the very beginning I was. But the schooling takes care of that. First night in embalming lab was a lady that was in a car accident and launched out of her front windshield.
[5\) Cremation or burial, or being set in amber or taxidermied?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|5) I'm always back and forth on this. Right now, I'd say cremation. 
[Are there any conditions in which you simply cannot allow an open casket funeral?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61qyrv?context=5)|It depends I guess. We had a person who died in a nasty car accident and on top of that had a full autopsy, so needless to say they were pretty messed up. The family INSISTED on an open casket and in situations like that you have to be honest with them and say something like, ""We'll try our best with restoring and embalming him and we'll let you know how everything goes by the end of the day.""
 |That particular case ended up being open casket. Dude actually looked pretty good (all things considered) 
[My sister-in-law committed suicide (gun to temple\) and sat in her car, in the hot texas sun for 24-hours before being found. my mother-in-law insisted on a private viewing. they told us the same thing. it was horrible. :\ she didn't look like the same person at all. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c620sve?context=5)|Yeh, that is unfortunate. Anything involving trauma to the head or face is very tough for a funeral director. We all look different when we die, regardless what the cause of death was. So when I'm embalming people, I really have no reference as to what they actually looked like. It can be tough... 
[Ever get a boner? *edit*:at work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61qvuo?context=5)|I can give you a definitive no, lol. 
[Do you ever cry at the funerals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61qi6u?context=5)|Nah. Don't get me wrong, there have been some sad moments but I've never full out cried. Saddest day for me personally was when a 19 year old kid came in to make arrangements for his dad that died out of state. 
[Hey, my sister in law is a janitor at a funeral home who is totally into the zombie craze.  I'm going to prank the shit out of her.  Would she get fired?  Also, any ideas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61uyq0?context=5)|Would she get fired? I don't know. Hopefully not haha. You should go into the funeral home and steal a body when shes not around and then put it in the back seat of her car.
 |But seriously don't do that. 
[My friend, Frank Reynolds, asks ""You bang the dead bodies?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wa4x?context=5)|Nah. I'm not even banging living bodies right now. 
[Do you find it hard to work on kid's corpses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61trqz?context=5)|Hardest part of the job. Hands down. 
[What's the most expense funereal you have directed? Seeing as how you hear about all these luxury caskets and what not ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61r8sg?context=5)|Right at about 20 grand. Solid mahogany casket and a bronze burial vault. I know what you're thinking, and I agree with you. It's ridiculous.
 |Also in case you're wondering I don't make any commissions. Strictly salary.
[Man, it must be a humbling experience to see people spend that much money on the deceased. But I can understand why they would want to spend money on someone that close to them, but still, that's a lot of money haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rc8z?context=5)|They paid in cash too &gt;.&gt; 
[*They paid.. Uh... 10 grand in cash. Coincidentally, I got a new car the same week* ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61t5cg?context=5)|Hahahaha, yeah right. I'd get fired so fast. 
[What is your relationship with the medical examiner's office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61vigl?context=5)|I don't mind the medical examiners office. It smells horrible. And one time they absolutely butchered a body on us. They didn't use sterile instruments for the autopsy and gave the  body whats known as ""Tissue gas."" Really really bad stuff. They also cut the left common carotid artery almost all the way up the neck. Not sure if it was an accident or whatever but I was not a happy camper.
[How do you go about dressing up the decedents, since they're all stiff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61vigl?context=5)|It's hard dressing them. We don't cut clothes either. You just have to lift them up with one hand and slip the clothes on.
[What is the embalming process like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61vigl?context=5)|Embalmings not that bad. You have to make sure the body is positioned the right way on the table and you'll be fine. Once the embalming fluid sets in, the body is going to become hard and it's not going to break position. The actual process is typically just one incision above the right clavicle and then fishing for the right common carotid artery. Raise that up, cut a slit into it and put the arterial tube in and start shooting down into the body.
[Sorry to be the one, but...proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61tql2?context=5)|I'm not really sure how I can go about proving this haha, I can take a picture of my embalmers permit I guess?
 |Edit: I mean it's not really much because I don't really want my full name out, but here's my student permit from the state [Link to i.imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/IQeLQ.jp) 
[Why do funerals cost so much? What is the average profit do you make a week? How long does it take to embalm a whole body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rbpd?context=5)|It's hard to explain why funerals cost so much. A funeral home operates differently from most normal businesses. There's no guarantee of steady income for the funeral home owner. So what I guess I'm trying to say is when you pay that 10,000 dollar funeral bill a good part of that money is going to pay for the funeral home's overhead. There are other reasons too but that's a big factor in things.
 |It's hard to say how much business we do dollar wise in a week. We've gone weeks without any deaths and we've had other weeks were it's just nonstop. But if you're talking me personally, I make the same amount every week regardless of what's going on.
 |To answer your embalming question, it varies by body. But anywhere from an hour and a half to two and a half hours. 
[It's not steady income when your Clients are dying to get in there?!  Sorry i'll see myself out. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wtef?context=5)|[Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obKLdou0LH0)
[So what you're saying is...funeral homes aren't assured of a steady income?  But aren't funeral homes the only business that could get new clients every day for the rest of human civilization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61s1cm?context=5)|Well kind of. There are a lot of funeral homes now a days. One in my area just recently had to close down. The competition just wrecked it. 
[That's utterly fascinating. Can you go into greater detail about the competition among funeral homes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61s4lv?context=5)|There are always new funeral homes sprouting up. And as of recently cremation services that undercut traditional funeral homes. The cremation service I work at charges 1300 dollars for a cremation while the funeral home equivalent is about 3000.
[What kind of prep goes into the bodies before they can be veiwed? Any differences for prep between open casket and cremation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61qlud?context=5)|Huge difference. For a direct cremation you honestly don't have to do anything preparation wise. If the deceased had a pace-maker or other battery powered medical device it needs to be removed before the cremation can take place, and that's just one incision on the chest.
 |For an open casket viewing the whole body is washed, basic sanitary care (cleaning fingernails etc...) embalmed, dressed, casketed, and finally cosmetized.
 |And if they were in any sort of accident then we have to get into using wax for restorative work but that's a whole other thing, and I honestly don't have much experience working with wax. 
[Do you guys always at least try to get a photo of the deceased, so you know how to best ""cosmetize"" them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61ynio?context=5)|We usually don't have a photo to go by which is why situations like that occur.
[An old friend of mine died; he was a true redneck.  His hair was always a mess and his beard scraggly. They had an open casket and his hair was trimmed like a banker and his beard could have felt right in place on some boy-band douche.  In death, he looked damn near nothing like he did in life.   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61ynio?context=5)|I always get told to do the same style of cosmetics for everyone but like you said, they need to look like they did in life. So it's that thin line between what I think and what my employers want..
[They don't always remove implanted medical devices. I've worked as a cremationist and have had a few explode before.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61tnuc?context=5)|I always check first thing when I get the bodies into the prep room. 
[The major culprit was a rinky-dink funeral home. It's scared the crap out of me a few times. Afterward, I'd have to sift through the cremains and find all the little pieces.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wu5e?context=5)|That's really not good. Can't that damage the retort and possibly injure you? 
[What would you do if someone near and dear to you became a ""client""? Maybe not so much a family member, but a friend or someone you knew back in school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61tld5?context=5)|I'd feel uncomfortable but I would do my job regardless. I wouldn't be able to embalm my parents...just thinking about it...nope. 
[When I go, will you stitch up my eyes and mouth for me? I'd rather know the person that does it. Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61r1kd?context=5)|I don't stitch eyes, there's a small plastic eye cap that I can slip under your eyelids for you though. 
[Nah, I'm good. Just some heavy coins will do, if you've got any. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61r8jv?context=5)|You know me, I always carry a satchel of heavy coins wherever I go. 
[Do you ever feel sad about the people you deal with or have you been desensitized? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61s1gq?context=5)|There was this young man who died and his son came up to me and with tears in his eyes he said ""hey thanks for doing my dads make up"" He was about my age. I wanted to vomit out of sadness.
[Ever had any paranormal experience or something that you can't explain while working in the morgue? I'm guessing one has to really not believe in ghosts to work comfortably in such an environment. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61ua15?context=5)|Eh, people ask me this pretty often. I'm not a believer in ghosts. Every once and awhile I'll hear a strange noise or see something out of the corner of my eye but the fact is, the funeral home is a reallllly old building. The noises are probably it just falling apart. 
[You mentioned you dont believe in heaven. I would think that religion is a pretty big thing with funeral homes and directors. How do you go about doing your job? Just fake it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c6222or?context=5)|Nah, when families talk to me about heaven and being with God and stuff I usually just smile and nod. I'm never the person to bring it up first. I respect people's beliefs especially at a time of loss and just roll with it. 
[Mortician.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61qlpq?context=5)|I actually was big into death metal during High School, but I never got into Mortician.

I thought it was funny and pretty well written but it's not completely accurate to the funeral director profession.

[Have you ever wanted to be a coroner? (That's my ULTIMATE dream job\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61uob5?context=5)|Not really, I think you need a masters degree for that and I just can't deal with more schooling right now. Being a coroner would be interesting though. 
[How do you handle the smell of decomp? Do you just grin and bear it? Do you shove cigarettes up your nose? How do you embalm bodies with damage to the circulatory system (amputations or massive trauma\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61vvrf?context=5)|I've gotten used to the decomp smell. Don't get me wrong, it's still nasty... But I just champ it out and make sure the exhaust fan is on.
 |Embalming bodies with a damaged circulatory system is a pain in the ass. Instead of a one point injection using the carotid artery, typically we'd have to make incisions in the arms and legs and raise the corresponding arteries to inject (axillary for arms and femoral for legs) and that's whats called a 6 point injection. 
[A friend of mine recently decided that she wanted to be a mortician and at first I couldn't believe it and could not understand why anyone would choose this career. It seems creepy (to be around the dead bodies\) and sad (to have to face grieving people everyday\). also, my mom's best friends father was a funeral director and he lived on top of the funeral home and that freaked me out as a child. Is it really as creepy as I think when you are there alone with dead bodies around you? How do you get used to that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61sxhh?context=5)|It's funny that you mention that. The other day I was driving a body to the crematory and in that moment I realized that I drive around more with dead people than I do with living passengers. It doesn't really bother me to be honest. I'm at that point where I see a dead body just about everyday, so it's really just another day in the office for me. 
[Hate to be the one to ask you, but have you ever experience anything you couldn't explain?..You know, paranormal?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61ymiv?context=5)|I haven't. And I've been alone in the funeral home many many times. A buddy of mine works in a funeral home a few towns over and he claims his is haunted. He told me a story of his co-worker being pulled down the stairs by a random mysterious force.

Basically just means dying of old age.
 |Preparation could take anywhere from an hour, to 3 hours for a normal body. If restoration is involved you're talking a full day project.
 |I met this really awesome black guy once. It was raining and I walked him back to his car with an umbrella so he drove me around in his Mercedes and we just chit-chatted about cars and stuff

It's literally impossible now adays, especially in America. In a third world country I could possibly see it happening but even then it's kind of a stretch.

I'm just a lowly employee but In the next few years I want to start a mortuary trade business with my friend. I'd try people with no experience. You just need to be passionate and professional about what you're doing.

It's worth it but you have to be passionate about the work you're doing or else you'll just get burned out. 
[Doesn't sound that bad at all, I've always been fascinated with death.

If so, how do you deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c6248vx?context=5)|It can be at times. It might sound harsh but I try to detach myself as much as I can. When I'm just doing removals and embalmings I don't even ask for the persons life story or details about the death. It's not that I'm purposely trying to be an asshole, but the more I know about the person, the harder it gets. 
[Thanks for the AMA, this is really interesting !  I'd like to know : How do your relatives react to your job ? Do they find it awful, or have no probl with it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61yn06?context=5)|Most of my relatives think it's weird but I don't talk to them that much. My friends don't really think anything of it. I don't even really talk about it that much with them, we just kind of hang out like nothing's changed. Just now I have to leave every once and awhile to pick up a body. 
[Thank you for the answer ! It seems funerals are seen the same way in US than here in Europe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c620wj7?context=5)|No problemo, they are probably similar. Maybe in another life I'll move to Europe and work at a funeral home. :] 
[Did you take the National Board exam? I graduated with a funeral director degree and passed the Science, but did not pass the Arts. Then life got in the way and I procrastinated, now I'm trying to self learn everything else I need to pass a few years later. How did you study? I have a lot of books that may be outdated, I wonder if they change the test too much to reflect new material? I wasn't exactly motivated to attempt the test again because it costs $200, I'm not currently working at a funeral home, and I would hate to fail it again. Any words of encouragement? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c621lu3?context=5)|Yep $200 per section. I passed both sections on the first attempt. Honestly, when it comes to studying hit vocab really hard. Even if you get a question you don't know, you'll be able to rule out which answers are wrong because you can recognize key words. It helped me out a lot, and also your books probably aren't all that out dated. I really don't think they update boards all that much.
[Do you notice a trend of what time of year has more deaths and what kind of deaths?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c622wmk?context=5)|Weirdly enough yes. It gets busy in January and February. My guess is that people that are sick hold out long enough to get through the holidays and once it's over and they've been around their friends and families they feel ready to let go.
 |Just my speculation though. It could just be coincidence.  
[I'm a pall-bearer (a couple of hours per week, I'm still in college\) and so I've been to many funerals, with many different funeral directors. I notice that when I'm near the coffin, most of the times you don't smell anything, but on rare occasions theres this weird smell. A couple of weeks ago, when it was very hot in my country, we had a coffin which smellt awful. The thing I can compare it most with is sour milk or something. My questions are: is that the body you smell or something else (chemicals to preserve the body for example\) and is this something the director is responsible for? Thank you for this ama.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61w6wp?context=5)|It could be a few different things. I suspect it could be a tiny bit of feces falling out of the bodies rectum. That shit happens pretty often. Or it could be that a limb didn't take the embalming fluid very well and is starting to decompose, and that's not always the directors fault. 
[How does your job relate to your personal life and style? Do you consider yourself 'weird'? Are you interested in 'darker' stuff, horror movies, collect skulls, anything like that? Or are you just an average Joe who happens to be a mortician?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c629dyd?context=5)|Oh I'm weird, but I don't collect skulls or anything. I actually hate horror movies, but I love ""Dark"" movies and movies that make you think. Shutter Island is a good example. Also I love metal, and I played guitar in a couple metal bands that never went anywhere. 
[I hope I'm not too late to the party for this. What do you do when you get a body that was discovered weeks or even a month after the time of death? Does that qualify for an automatic cremation? Also be honest, have you ever played a scare prank on any of your co workers or students??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c6206xh?context=5)|It has happened a couple times. One time we went ahead with the embalming and only allowed a private viewing. The other time the family just wanted direct cremation. Which is good...the body was pretty badly decomped at that point.
[What are your/the industry's views?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c62alka?context=5)|It depends on the funeral home. The place I did my internship at allowed me to come in looking scruffy with relatively long hair and stuff. The place I'm at now on the other hand makes me shave every day and get a haircut every 2 weeks.
[Edit: Also, any tips on getting an internship at a funeral home after schooling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c62alka?context=5)|But I wouldn't worry too much about it. A funeral director buddy of mine has full sleeves and his bosses don't give two shits. As long as you don't have any neck or face tattoos or anything too stand-out.
[Is it difficult?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c62alka?context=5)|Honestly the best way to get an internship is to just knock on the front door and ask. The internship is the easy part, and its also required for the schooling.
[One of my favorite television shows of all time is Six Feet Under. I loved the outlook on death it gave to its audience. My question is; Have you ever seen the show, and how accurate is it at portraying the business side of funeral homes and big business versus family owned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wt4n?context=5)|I saw a few seasons of six feet under. It's a good show but not 100% accurate of course. As far as the shows portrayal of family owned vs corporate owned, it was over the top. The funeral home I work at is family owned and we've never been dogged by corporate to sell. Even then I don't even think corporate funeral homes are bad. I'd work for one. 
[Sorry to ask another question. How about the restoration of the bodies? They often talk about things that seem rather unorthodox, like cans of cat food under the body to make it look more life-like. How much goes into restoring the bodies? And whats the best restorative work you have seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wzhm?context=5)|Ask away man. The best restoration I saw actually came out of a different funeral home. It was some politician lady who was in a head on car crash and her face got absolutely destroyed. But because she was a public figure the family wanted an open casket viewing so the funeral home restored this ladies entire face. I know the directors that did it and they took pictures of the whole process to show students, absolutely incredible. They used a series of hidden sutures and wax and she looked ended up looking pretty good.
 |We do unorthodox things I guess. When an autopsy is performed the persons throat is removed so I like rolling up some cotton and sticking in the person throat and then taking another sheet of cotton and rolling it into a ball to make an adams apple. We'll also take empty embalming fluid bottles and put them under their feet to prop them up and stuff like that. While we're dressing them we'll take pieces of tissue paper and stick it under parts of their jacket to make them look ""fuller""
 |A lot of funeral service is strictly visual. And sometimes you just gotta do some weird stuff to get the job done I guess. 
[Do you bury them with that stuff in the casket, or is there a time period in which you can remove it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c620k1f?context=5)|Sometimes we get the chance to remove it but we mostly leave it in. Buried a casket with kitty litter in it once (the body was leaking)
[Thank you so much for the answers, very interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61x26o?context=5)|Not a problem.
[Is there such a thing as ""coffin riders""? Did you think the show 6 feet under did a good job of showing the realistic issues of the mortuary profession (the job not the family drama\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61vw67?context=5)|Never heard of coffin riders. I've heard of Casket divers which is when a grieving family member almost jumps into the casket with the body, never seen it first hand though.
 |6 feet under was okay. Of course it was a little bit sensationalized to be interesting but yeh, some parts of that show are accurate. 
[If you donate your body to the local medical school is it true they pay for the cremation thus saving money for the family?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61tbzc?context=5)|Correct. You have to wait a year to get the ashes back though and the medical school might not accept the body into their program. 
[What is the cost of cremation as opposed to a traditional burial using the cheapest caskets?  Assuming the medical school didn't accept the body.  I think when I die I'd like to be cremated and have my ashes spread in the ocean or shot into space.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c621j0h?context=5)|There's a cremation service that will do a direct cremation for a grand. Most funeral homes charge about 2-3 grand for a direct cremation.
 |Also fyi, a body needs to be cremated in a cremation container, doesn't actually have to be a casket. Our crematory requires a minimum of a cardboard box. We don't charge the families anything for it. 
[Thanks for answering my questions sir!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c621tgs?context=5)|That's what AMA's are for, my friend. 
[I'd like to either be cremated or buried in a very simple box.  I used to be weirded out by being in the ground and worms and bugs coming in, but over time I like the idea of being ""recycled"".  I don't want to be buried in some sealed coffin though (e.g.: lead lined or something\).  My understanding is that although you think you'll be kept untouched, in reality anaerobic bacteria get to work in that environment and turn you to slush.  As such, if I do get buried, I'd rather have something simple that would degrade and integrate me with the world.  Is my understanding of sealed coffins correct?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c623w85?context=5)|I too like the idea of a simple burial. I feel like in a way I'd become one with the Earth as I deteriorate into nothing. Catholics on the other hand...Sealed 16 gauge metallic casket, double lined sealed burial vault... I don't understand them.
 |I believe you are correct, however I've never actually seen an exhumed body before.

[Is the preparation for infants any different? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wiab?context=5)|Yeah, It depends on the size. If the baby died during the gestational period then I'll just take a sheet of cotton, soak it in cavity embalming fluid (Really strong fluid) and wrap the baby in it. At that size it's arteries are too small to use for arterial embalming.
 |If it's a larger baby, it's one incisions through the ribs and injecting using the aorta. 
[Are there jobs you can have at a funeral home that don't involve any training or school to go to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c629fxx?context=5)|It's called being a UFD, Unlicensed Funeral Director. Basically you can help filing all paper work, assist at wakes and funerals, and I believe you can even go on removals as long as you're with a licensed director. Some of the corporate funeral homes hire for UFD's because it's just cheaper than hiring a licensed guy. 
[How much do you get paid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61xm8i?context=5)|35k a year.

I've smoked out of Bongs, Vaps, joints, Pipes ect. Just about anything you can think of. By far the best way to smoke weed is out of a hookah. I've done side by side comparisons with my extream Q vape and my weedsha and the weedsha wins hands down. I get higher and the high lasts longer and the flavor profile of the weed really comes through well too. Not Quite to the extent of as the vape but cloes. Also one bowl of weedsha will last for at least an hour.  It's just magic. Anyway, I made an album showing how to make it. Its dead simple just mix a little glycerin with your ground bud. pack it into a bowl and smoke it up. http://imgur.com/a/kHZVz
 in the album it was about a tablespoon of weed and a half teaspoon of glycerin. 

Also you can even smoke the leaves with this. So if you have alot of thoses grind them up add some glycerin and honey. Tates pretty good and you will get pretty toasty with them. 


Sorry about the grammer and spelling errors I wrote this while high. 
Your welcome internet ;)

P.S. This is my Hypothesis on how this works as well as it does. This isn't my field but I am a scientist (Computer Science and Physics). The glycerin has a boiling point of 290 °C all of the cannabinoids vaporize from 180c - 212c. Glycerin is a non-polar solvent and has been used as a replacement for ethanol for making of Botanical extracts. What I think is going on is that the THC CBN and CBD cannabinoids are dissolving into the solution of hot glycerin and part of that will intern get boiled off when you take a hookah rip.  The Glycerin may also be helping in keeping the cannabinoids from breaking down ""Burning"" when you smoke this might also account for why it works so well.

But now I want to ask what can I do to show my eagerness and my devotion and my yearn to learn as much as I can from the very start? Some of my ideas so far:

- introduce myself to the class, talk about my background, why I am there, what I will do, show and tell my excitement; ask my friend to translate some of my introduction to Spanish on paper so that I can read that to the class as well. 
- bring cookies/cupcakes. (What is the rule about bringing snacks now? Does it have to be store bought and packaged?) 
- bring a book to read aloud (if permitted) possibly a dual language book, in Spanish. (my accent is terrible and I don't know many words but I want to show that I am willing to try. Is this a good idea?)

If you have any other suggestions, PLEASE let me know what I can do. This is going to be my second internship, it will not be my student teaching which will be in the spring. If all goes well, fingers crossed, and I like my experience at this school and classroom, I will have the option of staying there in the Spring which would be amazing for my transition and learning experience.

Thank you very much!"

We learn the the infinity's voyage is sabotaged by guilty spark. I believe before cheif destroyed installation 04, guilty spark duplicated himself and shot his duplicate into space (later to be found by the heretics in halo 2) and the original was damaged in his flee from the exploding ring. this means that in halo 3, cheif kills the duplicate, and the infinity picks up the original monitor. If the storm factions are trying to complete the covenants original goal of destroying humanity (before the sidetrack of the great journey/great schism), and seeking the didacts help, then perhaps we are their biggest threat and with us out of the way, they could possibly overthrow the didact, take control of the promethean army and become what they always wanted to be: the keepers of the mantle. Maybe guilty spark wants the force of the infinty to back up the cheif in making sure the didact is protected and with the storm faction defeated, the didact could resume his power and put humanity back in its place. without guilty spak in a monitor casing (residing only in the infinty infastructure) it will be up to cortana to eliminate his presence. this could intern temorarily heal cortana, for i believe halsey is not capable of doing so. there is also mention of surviving precursors, so if the didact lives through halo 4, his priority will be capturing the remaining precursors."

Anyone have any ideas what I might be able to do?",tawhalen,energy,https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/zah7w/after_writing_about_it_for_a_while_im_interested/,"I work for a business that writes news feeds for other companies' websites. Over my time here, I've started to develop a bit of a niche writing for or about energy, including some in-depth pieces on solar, my own (admittedly basic) analyses of EIA data, and a white paper on natural gas. I've learned a decent amount about a number of fields and the more I learn, the more I think I'd be interested in working in energy for the long term. I have a master's in political science that I haven't used much, a few internships, and obviously my writing over the past year-plus, but not any explicit training in energy.

We remained friends, and would catch up now and then during summer and winter breaks from college, but nothing romantic.  She recently moved back to the area to do an internship for a year to complete her degree program, so we'd been hanging out every couple of weeks or so, but I completely took her off my dating radar based on the fact that she had a boyfriend and our history.  We went out for a friendly dinner this past friday, then she went to hang out with some friends I didn't know, and I went home.  Around midnight, she starts texting me, and eventually convinces me to come over, since my plans for the night had fallen through.  After I get there, I have a cigarette and make awkward small talk with all the people I don't know, and pretty soon she pulls me to the side.  She starts talking about how she wants to break up with him when he's in town over the weekend (he lives 6 hours away) but is going to have a hard time doing it, since they've been on and off for 2.5 years, and he's always dumped her.  She starts crying, so we go to the guest room in the house, talk a little more, and then start making out.  We hung out for a couple more hours with her friends, she walks me to my car, we kiss some more, then I head home.  I haven't spoken to her since (I figure I should give her space to deal with her boyfriend being in town).  What should I do next?

zagri,21,2012-09-03,It seems like everything I've done is undone,holdmykeysimgoingin,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/zagri/it_seems_like_everything_ive_done_is_undone/,"So I just got back from a wonderful internship on the West Coast in LA. I've always had horrible social anxiety and I decided putting myself out on a limb would be a wonderful way to build character, and it was. I had an amazing time, learned so much about myself, and changed so much as a person. I was right where I wanted to be on my road to recovery.

The problem is that now I am back on the east coast. Settling back into the same environment, it's almost like I settled back into the same old person I was before I left. My old thought habits, my old self-image, they all overpower me. I was very calm, relaxed, and optimistic in LA. However, back here I had my first anxiety attack in a while before I had to move back in to college. I'm also feeling the depression creeping back in. The critic in me, having been mute for a while, has found it's voice again and is picking up right where it left off. I forgot who and how to be the person I was this summer. **Seeing the same people again and the same environment again is somehow reinforcing my old self.**

I keep trying to be positive, but I just can't. My positive thoughts don't affect my emotions and anxiety at all, and trying to think positive just makes me feel more uncomfortable and anxious. I don't know what to do."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Do you sell our information?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62h4kd?context=5)|We sell ads. To offer a simple example: You surf on over to YouTube and begin watching a clip about ""How to Paint your Nails"". Now, you might have filled out user data specifying you are female, or, based on the video you're watching we determine that 95% of people who also watched this were female ergo we can assume so are you.
 |We look at all the Advertisers in our system and find one that said they wanted to serve ads to Females, and that's the ad you get to see while you're watching this video. That Ad is paying for the bandwidth and engineers that built the video service you're using, btw.
 |The advertiser wins because they get an ad that is targeted to someone who might actually care about the product. In this case, you win because you are getting to watch a cool video for free and you might see an ad about something you actually would use. And we win because we get a little bit of money and a warm fuzzy feeling.
 |Win-win-win. 
[That's actually pretty clever, what if i click this ad? Does that affect anything money-wise at all? Or doesn't it do anything? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62hiem?context=5)|That depends. In general ads are sold as ""CPM"" - or cost per mille (thousand impressions). That means the Advertiser is paying for every time an Ad is shown.
 |Google pioneered an auction mechanism where Advertisers would pay per click - no click, no pay! We do this by estimating the probability of clicks for a given advertisement on a given page, and optimizing towards showing ads that users will actually want, and thus click on.
 |New Ad models are being developed still. One example is video ads where the Advertiser doesn't have to pay unless the user watched the entire Ad (so didn't skip, or hit back, or close their browser, etc etc). 
[*One example is video ads where the Advertiser doesn't have to pay unless the user watched the entire Ad (so didn't skip, or hit back, or close their browser, etc etc\).*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62ijds?context=5)|Not if it's TrueView: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/t/advertising_trueview)
[Wait, so now if I go to YouTube and when an ad starts I hit the skip button the advertiser has to pay anyway?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62ijds?context=5)|With the skippable ad format on YouTube, the advertiser only pays when you watch 30seconds to to completion.
[Where do you think Google+ is going in the near future? Being a social layer for Google and all its products, do you have a plan to make it more common among people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62hotx?context=5)|Google+ is still fairly young. I'm sure everyone would have loved for it to have taken off and garnered 1B users in is first year, but that's unrealistic. If it provides value for users then they will sign up and continue to use it, and I believe there is the opportunity to provide value there.
[, another question if you don't mind, don't you think fragmentation of Android is wrong? I feel like Android should be NEXUS and only NEXUS. So many apps are not available on other devices due to different screen sizes and processors. Don't you feel like Android should be linked to just one Google device. I'd love it if I mentioned ""Android"" and the first thing that would come to a person's mind is ""(Google\) Nexus!"" Don't you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62hotx?context=5)|Yes, I believe that fragmentation of the Android market is a net negative, however I don't think that has to be settled by building out a single device. Look at Apple - they went with the single device model but infact have an entire ecosystem of devices now (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, and multiple version of each coexisting). 
[Can you save iGoogle? I realize there might be ""better"" options, but it gave me a single starting page that I've really grown used to and really like. I'm pretty upset since I really don't know what I'm going to change my homepage to now. If you can't single handedly save iGoogle (I'm sure you can, I believe in you\), then do you have replacement suggestions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62j1zg?context=5)|I know some of the folks who built iGoogle and they were pretty sad to see it go (they work in different parts of the company now, so were taken by surprise by the deprecation). That said, iGoogle never really fit the product vision.
 |My homepage is the Chrome new-tab screen.
[What is your salary?  how many shares of GOOG do you own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62iyj3?context=5)|My compensation is circa $200k this year. I currently own 0 GOOG shares, having just sold since I like to keep a diverse portfolio. I have many shares there are unvested, however. 
[How do you feel about Google's privacy policy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62h30f?context=5)|Extremely favorable. We have pretty strict privacy reviews internally and I'd hazard to say some of the folks reviewing are against most data collection / uses, so you have to work hard to convince them that it is indeed good for the user. I fundamentally believe that using user-data to determine something like ""Gender"" when the user hasn't explicitly provided it to us is worthwhile because it enables us to provide a better experience, like not showing tampon ads to guys. 
[Ok, I can verify that you work for google. Do you have anything that says your title?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62i3q5?context=5)|Just business cards which are all in my office.  I am a Google Employee who is allegedly a Product Manager, AMA. 
[If often seems like the different groups at Google aren't coordinating with each other at all.  Google Web Search is amazing but Youtube's search function is poor and Google Play's search function is abysmal.  On the day Google Drive officially launched, the Google Play team put Dropbox on the store's front page.  There was no mention of Google Drive until like 3 weeks later, and it was as a ""staff pick"" rather than editor's choice or with a highly-visible picture.  I can understand the desire to appear unbiased, it still felt like an extremely half-assed product launch.  I'd expect that a company like Google would have a common codebase to share among much of its software so that division A can take functional code modules from division B and not have to duplicate the work with people who may not be very good at that type of coding... but clearly this isn't the case.  What's the reason for this?    Also, Google's customer service is infamously terrible.  For example, if something gets removed from Google Play, the developer is rarely given a specific reason and their only recourse is to file a counterclaim - which has been known to take weeks *if not months* to be acknowledged, let alone acted upon.  My experience with Google CS leads me to believe that there's something like 8 people responsible for product suppport for every product and service Google offers.  Is Google doing anything to improve this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62hr0u?context=5)|YouTube was an acquisition. It has been a long time, but they were still acquired which means a different code base. It is notoriously difficult to consolidate onto a common platform while also growing at a rapid pace. It probably came down to someone (a product manager!) on YouTube saying search was good enough and their priority was actually X or Y. 
[What are your favorite google products?  What do you think about the difference between google docs and the new office live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62hw2b?context=5)|I haven't used Office Live, but I use Google Docs everyday and wouldn't even think about going back to MS Office but with one huge exception: Excel rocks. For a power user like myself Excel doesn't have much competition yet.
[What are your thoughts on the current state of software/design patents.  Do you think someone ought to be able to patent finger swipes and rectangular shapes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62h3hy?context=5)|Essentially the same as what Paul Graham wrote here [Link to www.paulgraham.com](http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html)
[What do you think of the patent trolls war actually (no no, i don't said Apple vs Samsung\) ?  I am seriously considering patenting round plates and cars with round wheels !](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62hayw?context=5)|It's a net loss for the industry. It uses up brain power that could instead be applied to innovation. And the Chinese are just going to steal it all anyways.
[Other then search, what's your favorite Google Product? If you won't hurt people's feeling by answering. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62hqnj?context=5)|GMail. I use it every day and more often than search. 
[Are you excited about the Sparrow acquisition? Did you use the client before it was bought?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62hu84?context=5)|I'm not familiar with Sparrow, but I'm always excited for founders that get an exit! 
[I'm an IT support manager and wish I could get a gig at Google, but I get the feeling that there's no need for someone like me there. Would that be true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62gyyu?context=5)|It's difficult to answer without knowing who you are and what you do. We have all of the general ""big company"" roles like internal IT, internal tools developers, etc - and while not glamorous they pull from the same pool of engineers as all of our other projects.
[Also, is Do No Evil still important?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62gyyu?context=5)|I believe ""Do No Evil"" is still important, in that it is part of our culture. But it's difficult to measure and peoples opinions on evil vary. 
[How hard is it really to get a job at Google?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62jsqc?context=5)|I believe there were some statistics around # applications vs # job offers, and it was something like 1 in 1 million.
[Sooo what do you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62h1ft?context=5)|I 'own' a product(s) at Google. Basically it means coming up with the product direction and vision, breaking that up into specific things that need to get done, and enlisting people who can do them. Example: engineers for writing code, legal for working out contracts, marketing for getting into trade shows, documentation for writing help articles and making training materials, sales for pushing the premium version of the product, etc.
[This is very different to what PMs did when I was there, which was essentially schedule meetings and deal with all the crap SWE didn't want to touch, while not getting to design a damn thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62h9y5?context=5)|Scheduling meetings is a by-product of needing to actually work with humans. If a PM isn't doing design (does not have to be technical design work per-say, can be product adoption design, or sales evangelism design, anything that the product needs) then either you have a bad PM or as a SWE you simply lack visibility into the rest of the product life cycle.  
[Hello, I was just wondering how flexible Google's policy is on hiring students who are looking for Product/Brand Management experience but have only just graduated/are about to graduate from their Bachelors in a Business field. Also, Where did you start off in the business field and how did you land a job at Google ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62h3dc?context=5)|Google has a program called ""Associate Product Manager"" (or APM) which brings in recent college grads and helps them pick up the art of Product Management through a two year rotational program.  Nearly all of our Product Managers have a Computer Science or Computer Engineering background, but a minority of them also have a Business Degree on top (usually an MBA). There are a few who have non CS/CE undergrad but these are often titled ""BPM"" or Business Product Manager and interact less  with Engineering.  I didn't start in the Business Field myself. I began my career as a Software Engineer and then switched over to PM a few years ago. I have no formal Business degree.
[Is there something similar to the Google Associate PM program in Europe? London, Zurich,.. ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62j3ym?context=5)|The APM program does extend to Europe. In fact, many APMs rotate around the world during the program.
[How much do YOU hate Internet Explorer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62k7fy?context=5)|As someone who has developed web services of my own I kind of hate IE because nothing works right.  
[What's your view on people who jailbreak and tamper with Google products? Do you mind them doing so? Do you follow people (blog wise\) who do so and see if you could add them into the main product? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62imy9?context=5)|I don't have a problem with people jail breaking products. I've done it in the past (when I had more time / was into the scene) but now I appreciate the technology for what it was built to do.
 |I don't follow or reach out to anyone in that community. I don't work on Android though.
[I want to study/major in computer science and my dream job is to work with Google's Android team. Is there a low demand for this field (computer science/programming in general\), and is there a strong likelihood I'll end up unemployed after graduation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62hqcm?context=5)|If you've got a CS degree from a reputable school and/or work in the field it's very hard to not find employment right now. Your time in school should be spent on getting a solid foundation of Algorithms, Data Structures, and Languages/Operating System Internals.
[*edited for clarification.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62hqcm?context=5)|You usually get some free-form projects to do so you can tailor them towards Android. Then apply for an internship at a top firm like Google, Facebook, Microsoft while in school and leverage that towards the full time offer when you graduate. 
[What are the best perks in the building? And where is it that you are actually located? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z8tlz/i_am_a_google_product_manager_ama/c62l46t?context=5)|My favorite perks are the in-house massages and travel. I work with a lot of distributed teams so I've had the opportunity to travel to 15+ Google Offices across the globe. Each has its own vibe to it and of course, the food is fun to try!

z9pfx,2,2012-09-03,Post break up troubles,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/z9pfx/post_break_up_troubles/,"My ex-bf [23m] broke up with me [23f] roughly 6 months ago.  He had moved across the country pre-break up, which obviously put a strain on the relationship, but also made the break up slightly easier for me.   Post break up we went through a long patch of not talking because I was traveling and he made little effort to respond to my emails.  When I returned we started talking a bit and eventually he tells me he's seeing someone.  Of course my heart drops a little bit because it hits home, but he's single, so I just tell him he's free to do what he likes.  A couple days later he tells me he broke up with this girl, implying it was because of me, and that the relationship wasn't serious anyway.  We start casually talking more and he begins to sound more and more like a completely different person.  He starts saying superficial things about women he meets, telling me about hot girls at bars and women he's having sex with.  Of course these things bother me, but I just deal with them cause I know he needs to get it out of his system, and hey, it's pretty normal post-break up.  All the while I hadn't been seeing or interested in any men, but when I do finally mention a friend I was interested in (roughly 4 months) he goes crazy.  He gets mad at me because this guy is my friend and says there's more emotional commitment than what he's been doing, which is purely physical.  Then he tells me that he feels like our relationship of 1.5 years meant nothing to me.  I still think this was really unfair of him to say.  I went on one or two dates with said friend, and nothing more. 



All of this culminates into an argument that ends in me essentially yelling at him via fb chat and him blocking me from fb and gchat.  So after a month of no talking, I try to add him on fb and he doesnt respond.  Almost a month after that I send him an email of an article I think he'd be interested in and just say that I hope he's doing well.  He responds, and we share a couple emails back and forth and then it ends.  Then he adds me back on fb.  Then a couple nights ago he ims me and we talk for 3 hours or so.  And it's a really nice conversation, but during the course of it, he asks me if I'm seeing anyone.  I just say no, I'm not, and I change the topic.  I'm not interested in hearing more about his exploits.  Later he goes back to the subject and I say that I went on a couple of dates, but I'm just not ready to be with anybody yet.  That I need some time to be single.  The truth is I'm not completely over my ex, and I don't want to burden other men with that.  Completely unsolicited he tells me about the women he's been seeing and the great sex he's been having.  Honestly this doesn't bother me much at first.  He tells me about this girl he was dating and how they broke up because he was cheating on her.  Then he tells me how he's done with his wild streak and is looking for a nice girl to settle down with.  And I think that's when it started to bother me.  I still remained diplomatic throughout the night, though I was super erked.  The next morning I did something I shouldn't have and I messaged him telling him I didn't ask about the women in his life because I didnt want to know.  And I apologized if it came off dickish sounding, but that was just how I felt.  Of course he didn't respond.  



Today I had something happen with my father and was anxious, worried, in tears, and alone.  I don't have a phone right now, otherwise I would've tried to text or call a friend, so I email him asking if he would talk to me for a bit cause I was feeling frazzled.  He responds right as my mom comes home, though I don't see his response.  I end up talking to my mom for an hour and feel better, but I respond to him anyway and tell him what happened and why I had wanted to talk.  He doesnt respond much and says he has to run to a friend's soon.  After I'm done explaining everything he says that he's hopes everything works out and that he's heading to his friends.  


I was literally in complete shock at this point.  Maybe I shouldn't have been, but I was.  Not even a ""sorry"" or a remote sense of empathy.  Then being fueled up I did another thing I shouldn't have: I said fine, fuck you too.  I can't believe I don't get an ounce of empathy from you.  

It was dumb and it probably satisfied him, but oh well it felt good in the moment.  


Anyway I'm trying to avoid communication, but I feel obligated to check up on him because of his depression and counseling, which few, if any, of his friends know about. I still love him, but I'm not trying to get back together.  We live thousands of miles away from each other and are at different places in our lives, but I still care about him and want to be able to talk casually once in a while.  I just can't understand why he's being so cold and aggressive towards me despite the fact that he's the one getting laid, getting dates, living on his own in a cool city with a super awesome and well paying job and his dream internship.  Honestly anyone looking at the two of us right now would say that he got the better deal.  I still live with my parents, work at a restaurant, and am trying to ""figure out"" the rest of my life.  Also, like I said, less than a hand full of dates and absolutely no hook ups post-break up.  So I can't understand why my ex is being so hostile, especially considering he's usually a very placid man.  Do I really have to completely cut off all contact with him permanently? And HOW do I do that. I think it's been extraordinarily difficult for me because our break up came at a very strange and critical point in my life.  My coworkers are all a bit older, and I'm not really into the part scene so it's difficult for me to meet new people (I made an Okcupid account but have met very very few people from there, and nothing lasting).   

baaagh, I hope this isn't completely stupid. I guess I just need some outside perspective.  


**TL;DR: Ex-bf being hostile in our few and far between conversations, but I can't quite seem to completely let go.**

z9nel,4,2012-09-03,Starting over from city planning,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z9nel/starting_over_from_city_planning/,"Hey guys,

A little background:

I graduated with my Masters in City Planning (emphasis in green planning) in May 2011 with internship experiences but no job offers.  Little did I know that planning was probably a bad idea.  I was unemployed and miserable for over a year.  I finally got work with my state government.  It is in their public safety department and has nothing to do with my field.  It also is low-paying, but there benefits are not bad.  I am grateful to have some work, but knowing I am doing the same job that only requires high school education is a bit upsetting.  This certainly seems to be a similar story for many of us.

I have tried and tried to find way to make planning work.  I am ready to close the book.  I just can't pick everything up though since I am 27 now and can't afford time or money-wise to go to college all over again.  I am taking the building code certification exam and am hoping that it may be something that can help me to at least get a foot in the door for something better.  It is time to start over though because it is clear the only ones making any money off this planning things are the colleges.  I have done everything under the sun to make it work.  I have researched planning and tried to network.  Everyone seems to now finally admit it isn't just the economy that isn't why planning jobs are so hard to break into.  It is the fact that it is a field that only seems to have opportunity for maybe ten out of the hundreds of people in the field.  I want to be able to have a job that is fun, introvert-friendly, and won't have me barely making ends meet.  I am 27 now though and therefore need to approach this carefully since I am not that young anymore.

Is there anything you recommend I should reinvent myself into?  Is there anything maybe that I already have skills in that can carry over but this time more productively?  I am open to getting more education or something if it isn't a huge drain on me for time or money.  I want to have a job that is interesting, secure, and has a good future. I cna tell you more on things I know if it helps.  Thanks guys.

Tl;dr How does a person in her late 20s re-invent herself career-wise from city planning?"

I've been applying jobs mostly through searching for available positions then submit cover letter/resume in addition to questionnaire or whatever is requested. I have a few questions regarding certain ways to approach.

*Currently, I'm applying for an internship position with a small water district. They have a small website without an HR contact. However, these contacts are available:  Deputy Director/Operations,  Senior Civil Engineer,  Channel Maintenance Superintendent, and  Interim Water Resources Coordinator (P.E.). Even thought they do not have an available position posted, I just wanted to try and send them my resume and hope to get a call for at least an intern position. Which of the following persons should I send to? Should I apply even though there's no postings?

*As mentioned above, I usually only send cover letter/resume and requested documents through searching for available and posted positions. I'm not sure if I've been doing it the right way, or is there a better way to approach?

*For interviews, I usually only bring a few copies of resume, some note papers and a pen. Should I bring copies of proposal or reports that I've worked in the pass (hard copy or electronic)? If yes, bring for full time position only or for part time also? I know different professions approach interviews differently in terms of what to bring, but what about CE?

*Additional tips would be appreciated, especially for intern position. 

I know my sister got a math teaching position by sending a large package that includes 3 reference letters (probably not needed for applying intern CE position, not sure about full time position).

Also, I'm in the US, so those CV or CDR are probably not needed?"

I throwaway-d this since I'm pretty sure shes a reddit reader. 

Anyhoo, I am currently in a strange situation with a girl, where we are pretty much connected at the hip/soulmates and we met online last July on a dating site. She is in her early 20s whereas I am 4 years older. She was out of the country for a few months, but we corresponded daily for HOURS and it was kinda shocking how well we clicked. Around December we met up, and it was a bit awkward probably due to the online-to-person shift. Given it was a dating site and she was interested in long-term relationships on there, I asked if this was a possibility, and she said she was too busy (since her program and job took up literally all of her time, which I could understand). Given this is not-interested cliche 101, I was kinda down about it for a while and we drifted apart for a month or two. I assumed she was afraid to potentially settle down due to being too young and interested in doing the more casual and short term things and partying it up etc, whereas I am very LTR-oriented and, I guess, mature for my age.

When summer hit, we started becoming close and communicating all the time again, even more than when we first met, and into more personal/serious life things, and she seemed to be initiating everything and would go out of her way to bring up hanging out and such. We ended up hanging out 2 or 3 times in a week (at the end of July) without the awkward feeling like before, and she was asking me to pick out shoes for her and what haircut to get and such (aren't haircuts serious lesbian business?) She has been out of the country for a few weeks to an internship in Asia :( . I figured maybe mellowed out or matured or something and could ~possibly~ have changed her initial opinion of not being into a relationship. I am not going to bug her or ask anything and leave it up to her because it was stressful enough for me the first time and rejection. 

I guess the point of this wall of text is do you have any similar stories? What is your first impression of whats up with this girl? Also am I doomed to being relationshipless until I'm ~30 because apparently anyone between 19-26 is interested in sleeping around and not taking anything seriously/restore my faith in humanity kthx? 

(I live in a pretty large city in Cali, so it's not like there are 3 lesbians here, but no one else seems to be interested in a serious relationship, and now my feelings are preoccupied with this girl so I can't mentally fake being into someone else)"

z9bg0,14,2012-09-02,Changes I've noticed in the past 90 days,TheMortifyd,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/z9bg0/changes_ive_noticed_in_the_past_90_days/,"Hey there Nofap! I have made it, three months completed. 

I'll skip right to the changes I've noticed:

* **Controlling my mood.** I have stopped getting angry for no reason. Usually when I'm stuck in school for an extra couple hours to do homework, I'm not in the best of moods. Or when I'm in traffic. Now I think, ""what's the point in getting upset about these things?"" On the other spectrum, people usually get in a great mood when they think about that promotion they just got, or that girl they just had sex with, or the fact that tomorrow is Labor Day. Now, I am trying my best to draw drawing my happiness from within. I'm no longer getting angry about this minor stuff in life and I'm trying to stop outside influences from changing my mood.

* **No girlfriend, no problem.** I've been dead set on getting a girlfriend all my life, but now I've realized there is no point in getting a girlfriend. There's no point in constantly thinking about whether a certain girl likes you or not, no point in getting over excited about a girl, etc. I've eventually started thinking about the point of having a relationship with a girl in general; If it happens it happens. It shouldn't be my goal in life, my goal in life should be something more meaningful in my eyes.

* **Physically.** I have lost some weight and gained some muscle after I've encouraged myself to work out more. I've been trying nofap on and off for the good part of this year and prior. In the time I started trying, I gave up soda, fast food, candy, sweets, started eating less and started running more. I believe nofap has helped to give me the discipline required to start to get myself more in shape.

* **Discipline.** For example, I've only been taking cold showers. Why? Because I want to take cold showers, that's why. I've started spending less time procrastinating and doing useless things and instead doing something useful in my spare time, like learning a new programming language for example.

* **Less negativity.** I used to talk really negatively to people and occasionally making fun of them, mostly because my friends were doing so, and I was copying them. Now, I see how immature and unnecessary that is. I try to keep my internal brain chatter positive, and my conversations upbeat. I can't control the negativity all the time, but I try my best.

There are so many changes I've noticed, but those were the major ones. 

About me: I'm a 16 year old guy. I started my junior year of high school last week. I have been able to keep myself busy this summer by working full time at a paid internship with a Fortune 500 company. I've noticed that during this summer, I felt like I have a purpose, I know where my life is going, and I'm happy with the road I've chosen in life (this might be another result of nofap among other things). 

Don't want to keep this post too long, so let me know if there's anything else I can answer for you guys and gals. Remember the phrase, ""I'm NOT fapping today."" 

I wish you all the best, you guys rock.


**Edit:** Thanks for all the kind words and feedback! I'll respond to every single one of you :)"

It was challenging to come across a law office in my city that had the ability and time to allow a senior in high school in their midst.

I am a Chinese and International Studies double major, I'm considering a minor in Business, and I plan to pursue a JD/MBA after graduation, so I am pretty much open to any sort of law/business related internships. 

I have been studying Chinese for several years now and have study abroad experience in Shanghai, so Chinese language skills are not an issue for me. I would certainly prefer to find a paid internship, although an unpaid one might be doable depending on what sort of work it is (I absolutely refuse to pay one some service to place me into an internship). 

My ideal internship would be working at a foreign law firm in China, however opportunities seem to be few and far between, with most geared toward current law students or recent graduates. Does anybody know of any resources I could use to find jobs or have any experience working/interning in this sector? Thank you!"
z994t,11,2012-09-02,Just need to get this off my chest,justasathrowaway,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/z994t/just_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,"Don't even know how to start and sorry in advance if this ends up being convoluted or having weird grammar, english is not my first language so this might get a bit confusing.

Currently I'm 23 years old and trying to finish college. I did pretty well in high school and managed to get into college and ended up choosing an engineering major without giving too much thought, just because math and physics were my favorite subjects. The college I go to is in my hometown, so I still live with my parents and in the country I live you don't get into huge debts to get into college, so this all led to a situation where I never really needed to get out of my comfort zone.

All this while having social anxiety. Never outgoing in middle school and high school, I was pretty much just the smart kid. I managed to get a group of friends who went through pretty much all of middle school and high school with me, so at least I never had that problem of being bullied or not having any friends, but just because I pretty much grew up with them. 

Never had a girlfriend or even tried to pick up a girl because of how anxious I'd get, always finding a way to rationalize a reason to let it go and maybe next time I'd try something. Parties were a nightmare, the few times I'd go to one, the only thing going through my mind is how to leave as soon as possible.

Then college came and I got worse. Never made any friends, just some acquaintances because I'd avoid going out. Got really fat until last year when I pretty much needed to change all my eating habits. Getting less and less motivated in college because I was never sure if that was what I really wanted or if I could pull through.
Classes were easier because I'd just sign up for them online and show up and study alone for tests but still had a lot of anxiety every time I needed to speak in public, to the point of barely being able to brush my teeth because I felt like throwing up. Without the motivation I was a mediocre student pretty much in all of my classes.

But then came the part of needing internships and building up a resume and this is where I'm fucking everything up. I spent the last 5 years dreading internship interviews and would again rationalize some excuse to avoid it. That it was too soon to get an internship, that I'd need time to study for hard classes, that my classmates that were applying were better anyway so I shouldn't bother...Until I ran out of classes and just needed the experience to graduate. I couldn't even apply anywhere even though I needed to, took me almost a month to gather the courage to start a word document to type my resume, even though it is pretyt much empty. So last semester at the last minute I got something in a college lab with a pretty chill professor because a classmate suggested it. So he recommended me somethings to do, even though I could tell he was doing that just to help me out and never really needed it. And still I went home and started doing, but never feeling it was good enough to go back and show him, and the more the time passed the more I thought I needed to do and felt anxious about going back. Long story short, I spent the semester doing pretty much nothing worthwhile. So now here I am with a new semester starting up and I have to clean up my own mess and stop being a piece of shit.

At the end of July I went to a psychiatrist by myself and told her this stuff and she diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety, prescribing some meds and that I should see a therapist too. I didn't want to start the medication without talking to my family first about everything, so of course here we are at the beginning of september, I avoided this completely and I'm pretty sure the prescriptions are not even valid anymore and I was too scared to take the meds anyway.

I feel like my life has been falling apart while everyone else thinks I have it all figured out, an aspiring engineer about to graduate and everything while I know I'm messing everything up. And the worst thing is that I don't think social anxiety and depression are things people get, and telling all this I would just seem like some whiney spoiled dude who can't man up, and even I doubt I'm not just trying to make excuses for myself.

I don't really know what I'm trying to accomplish here, just needed to vent, I guess. I don't really feel like proof reading this, so sorry if this is terrible to read if you made it this far."

So anyways I took advantage of the 35% off sale hookah-shisha sale. I bought the blue 1 hose Mya econo gelato. I paired it with the Melon berry Romman and cherry blossom Al Tawareg. I also chose the Coco Nara coals over the quick lights after hearing how much better the naturals are.

I feel like I've made a big mistake in my life, and I've already invested so much time and money I'm screwed whether I keep going or not.

I remember being warned before going, repeatedly, by people in and out of law school that it would be rough. Undergrad me thought ""no way, I'm smart, I'll come out on top like I've always done."" Nope. I'm barely middle of the pack at a mid-tier law school.

And then, of course, employment. The law market is brutal--I don't need to post the statistics here, but if you're paying attention at all, you know it's bad. I'll be lucky to make $50,000 when the student loan payments come in. Was that worth 3 years of life, paying ~$100,000?

In the meantime, I'm stuck here in 3L year with useless BS electives, 90% of which have nothing to do with the field of law I'm interested in or will be useful on the bar. Why does 3L year even exist? Oh right, for law schools to shake another $10-20,000 out of you.

I took an unpaid internship this past summer in the field of law I'm interested in. I enjoyed it--and the kicker is, I learned FAR MORE by working for other lawyers for FREE than I do in my expensive, boring, esoteric law school classes.

I'm almost disgusted and angry when I see on facebook or at my own school, new people entering 1L. I think ""don't you pay attention at all?"" And then I think, no, I was naive like them, too. And in one or two year's time, they'll probably figure it out like I have and wonder why they didn't listen."

zcw3b,1,2012-09-04,Reasonable raise to ask for after probationary period?,shinja59,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zcw3b/reasonable_raise_to_ask_for_after_probationary/,"So I've been working for a marketing consulting firm in Boston since I graduated in May, as a marketing assistant intern. The contract I signed with them explicitly said that after a 4 month period I would be given a pay increase along with being brought on full time as a 'marketing associate'. I have a performance review in a few weeks specifically to discuss a potential raise and for them to officially let me know what kind of benefits I'll be getting, and I was wondering what a reasonable amount it would be to ask for.

Its a small company (around 10 full time and a couple independent contractors, although I'm one of only two 'junior' employees) but they definitely do consistently well in terms of annual revenue and have been around for decades that I doubt that budget would be their excuse for not granting me the raise size I want, and it'd probably be moreso based on merit. In that regard I've definitely done well enough and have enough evidence to back up my contribution to the company.

My current wage is $14/hr without benefits (definitely should have negotiated but I was just thrilled to get a job after majoring in English Literature lol), which currently comes out to a little under $30,000 a year. I've asked a few people who also had a future raise written into their contract and one of them said he only got a 4% raise at his probationary period, while another friend said she received a 12% raise, so I'm wondering what jobbit thinks is reasonable for my specific situation."

Personal portfolio - am I doing it right?,tymis,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/zcode/undergrad_cis_game_design_personal_portfolio_am_i/,"Hey there. I'm a community college sophomore aspiring towards a career in game development. My interests are broad. Ranging from programing to game theory to 3d modeling and midi composition. My main interest thus far has been level design, and how it entails all of the things I just mentioned.

So far all I have made releases in is for Doom's ports; Zandronum, GZDoom and Boom. I have also done some experimentation in the UDK engine. Once I'm finished working with doom, I plan to shift to UDK, Source and Amnesia's HPL engine.

Ideally, while here in college, or soon after, I hope to join or start an indie development team. Although viable alternatives include working for larger companies or doing internships.

I'm posting this perhaps for a sliver of shameless self promotion, but also for some input on whether what I'm doing with my portfolio is worth its while, and how I can further extend my reach.
I've gotten a many suggestions that it is not wise to work within a game design degree, although it residing within computer science and not design (CS: game design) is supposedly better because you can jump over to software development, which I'm willing to do once I have the skill, and if nothing else presents itself.

I'm learning a lot about game design from various different perspectives through working with the doom engine, as much as I could expect to learn with any fully modern 3d engine (which I will soon move on to). Is this still impressive to someone who's hiring? 

I have a personal site with a blog and a project archive here:despiteyourface.rfc1337.net/index.html

ps: I'm aware that the bots swarming my blog is not healthy. Doing my best to find a solution.

I already bought the previous one but it might not be too late to cancel, but I just wanted to see if anyone can confirm because I know barely anything when it comes to laptops. If the performance is going to be the same on the Intel machine, then I'll just stick with that.

zcm5u,2,2012-09-04,[22/m] A couple of girls have been driving me crazy over the last few years...,Shtuff_N_Such,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zcm5u/22m_a_couple_of_girls_have_been_driving_me_crazy/,"So here's the story... Bear with me, it's pretty long. TL;DR at the bottom.

In my last year of highschool, I started going out with the girl of my dreams. Short red hair, athletic frame, rabid curiosity, loves learning new things, ... on and on about all the things I love in a girl. She ended it as I was about to go to college and she had another year left. We had both said that we believed we were in love with one another, and I at the very least really truly meant it. 
 
A couple of months later, she was dating another guy. I felt betrayed by her and so I went about proving to myself that I could find a replacement for her. In about 2 months, I had something like 30 girl's phone numbers that I had never called (and later felt like a jerk for it) and yet felt no better about the situation. 

In October of that year, I met a pretty cool girl who I got along really well with. At this point, I just wanted to move on and so another relationship felt like a way to do that. Me and this new girl, henceforth known as October, started dating in January. We dated for a few months, but me coming ""out of the closet"", so to speak, as an atheist really hurt our relationship (as she was Catholic) and almost caused it to end at that moment.

That summer I did end it, because she is actually a very needy soul. (Wants boyfriend time, all the time) I wanted to spend time with my family and working, not four hours a day on a cellphone talking about some coworking being dumb and saying ""I wuv u"" back and forth. During the summer, I went on a mission trip with DreamGirl (who had become single) and her church. Aside from all the awkward Jesus Camp moments, it was a really awesome trip and I got really close to her again. After the trip, she would come over to my place and we would lay on the ground and talk as we pointed out cloud shapes. I was falling head over heels for her again and I knew it. Anyday, I was going to ask her back out. About that time, October called.

Her mother had been diagnosed with cancer, and I was the only person she could talk to about it. Though I'm not the most empathetic soul, I tried to console her as her life was seemingly falling apart. I didn't know what to do. She was still after me, her mother was at stage four, and I just wanted DreamGirl. I thought I'd decide this when I got back to college.

Only that didn't happen. October comes over to my new apartment, and out of weakness I am seduced into kissing her. I fall right back into the same pit that I had clawed my way out of earlier in the year. DreamGirl falls away as I am trying to deal with October in a way that lets everyone win. Problem is, there isn't one. After a couple of months of badgering, crying, and begging to get back with me... I consent. DreamGirl falls away as I allow October to shut her out of my life and gets a new boyfriend. Even so, I occasionally text DreamGirl for hours at a time about anything and everything. October finds out, and bars me from talking to her. I do it anyways behind her back. 

A few months later, October's sister is diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer. She is distraught, sometimes says things about self-harm, but refuses to talk to a professional because ""I'm not crazy"". I turn 21. One night she stays over, we lose our virginity together. Puritanical upbringing of taking a girl's/losing one's own virginity creates cycle self-loathing/feelings of responsibility to her. Give October a promise ring out of those feelings, knowing it's a bad idea for both of us. DreamGirl is still with the guy she met last year.

Over the course of the next year. October refuses to have sex again because ""she is scared of a condom breaking"" (Catholic and doesn't use any form of birth control) and her family members with cancer have varied results with chemo. I am depressed, because my GPA dropped/lost my scholarships, I was stuck in a relationship I didn't want, and the girl I'm actually in love with is still with another guy, and I didn't see an end to any of it. 

Using my people skills, I land an awesome internship for that summer. A lot of verbal abuse, lack of appreciation, and differences in lifestyle leads me to break up with October. I finally explode on her about all the shit she's put me through and how I was sick of being treated that way. I resolved myself to staying away from her. I blocked her number from my phone. Would still get 20 calls a day for a couple of weeks. Worked my hours, lived life. Over the course of the summer, I wrote DreamGirl a long letter telling her how she was the girl who got away. She sends a response saying that she is sure that I will find a girl that will be able to fulfill all my needs like she couldn't. How can I tell her that she was, is, and will be more than I could ever want? 

October and I are heavily involved in the same orgainization. I'm the Treasurer, she's the President. Business necessitates us talking. She talks about how she's changed, how this summer was a eureka moment for her. Moments of self-awareness blah blah blah. The comfort of a woman's body and the promise of a changed soul draws me back into the arms of October, but my eyes still look and see my DreamGirl. I run into her on campus, we flirt, I want to think something is there. I don't know if there is for her, however. I want to tell her that I still love her, but ruining the fragile friendship we currently have would be almost too much for me to bear right now. Hope keeps me going. But at some point, hope must give way to reality. Only reality involves her boyfriend of almost two years...

Should I give up on them both?
Should I chase Dream Girl?
Should I trust October?

What's a guy to do in this sort of situation?


TL;DR: I'm a dumbass who let the girl of his dreams walk away on multiple different occasions and is constantly being sucked into a relationship with someone who probably is no good for me no matter how much I want/try to leave it. I don't know if I should just walk away from both of them, chase Dream Girl (who currently has a boyfriend), or trust that the girl who says that she has changed has, indeed, changed.

zclfg,13,2012-09-04,A trick to handle feedback loops,[deleted],livesound,https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/zclfg/a_trick_to_handle_feedback_loops/,"Apologies in advance if this is a silly thread. 

A certain live engineer (say, X) I know who does a lot of live shows around the world, was recently discussing techniques of handling feedback issues with an intern of his. I joined the conversation kinda late so didn't really have an opportunity to discuss it with X and he left. I ended up asking the intern what he was talking about and he said that X mentioned using delay plugins to automatically kill feedback. Since the intern is pretty new to this he didn't quite understand what X was telling him, so he couldn't describe it to me either. I was wondering if any of you know what X was talking about.

Now I'm a fairly boring live engineer(I'm more of a studio rat), I focus all my energy on the mix but I've been having a lot of trouble with feedback. I often have to work with crappy gear so ringing out and smart positioning of wedges is usually all I get to work with.

I won't have a chance to talk to X for months now, so I thought I'd post it here to see if any of you knew what he's referring to. Is there any way of using the delay effect to cancel feedback loops? If no one responds here or this isn't enough information for you to post a reply, I'll repost this with more information once I have a word with X.

zc9q9,1,2012-09-04,My Boss is (possibly) terminally ill and the staff can't continue to keep the company afloat in her absence. What do we do???,thisisjustterrible,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zc9q9/my_boss_is_possibly_terminally_ill_and_the_staff/,"Okay, so here's what's happening...

I have be a ""freelance"" employee of a very small (less than 5 staff) office for about 2.5 years. Earlier this year I went from a full time to part time position because I got another job. I put freelance in quotes above because we have never been treated as freelancers despite that being our title. Basically she called us that for taxes and so she didn't have to offer us any benefits. Why stay in such a job? It was in my field, which has freakishly limited opportunities where I live, I'm newer to the industry, and I needed the work.

The set up of the company is The Owner, and below her The Assistants. The Owner is the figure head of the company. None of The Assistants has the credentials or professional title that The Owner has. None of The Assistants has worked with her for more than three years. 

Since early this year, The Owner has gotten sick. Very sick. She won't tell any of us the full details of her condition or what if any prospect there is of recovery. I gather from her vague answers to questions (or avoidance of them) that it is possible that she is terminally ill. There is a myriad of things wrong with her it would seem. She hasn't been in the office more than 5 times in the last 6 months. She stopped talking to anyone on the phone as well (this appears to be in part because of her condition) and now only communicates via email, and the majority of her emails for months and months were full of vitriol and just the meanest things, quite out of character. I'm the only person that has seen her in about 3 months, only because I went to her house to bring her mail (so I can verify she really is sick). She talked to me a bit. She is pretty much going through every stage of grief. She is angry all the time, she is really young and most of the health stuff shouldn't be happening to someone her age. 

But we The Assistants are in quite the pickle. Well not me so much, I have the opportunity to go full time at my other job, so my only vested interest is the well-being of the Owner and other Assistants. We want to be there to help The Owner, but she is making it practically impossible. She is frustrated that the company isn't bringing in money, but she keeps giving discounts and none of us is in the position to pursue new clients because we all lack the credentials. We aren't comfortable making sales calls because we feel pretty morally icky selling our company's services when we can't guarantee the longevity of the company. She has put the entire responsibility of the company in the hands of her one full time Assistant, a girl with less than a year's experience in our industry. And then she wonders why the Assistant is stressed and upset and wants to pursue other job options. It's their right to know what the future of the company is so if they need to look for other work they can. 

We have all given her so much and want so badly to help her because we like her and all have a lot of time and energy invested in this small company. 

Her full time Assistant just put in her two weeks notice. I'm actually at a point were I am working almost freelance-ish, so I can just walk away. But we still feel this obligation to help. What do you do when a small business has to close because the owner is sick? What if she can't pay her medical bills? Has this happened to anyone else? Anyone had to close a business due to illness? I'm saying close because at this point she has no one to run the office for her. And I cannot imagine her interviewing and training new people, she's too sick. She's known that the full time Assistant has been wanting to look into other areas of our business for a while, really since she started working with us (she started as an intern but this was actually never her career path of choice, just sort of a foot in the door, God bless her for sticking it out as long as she has). 

We can't just wash our hands of it, is there anything we can do to make this situation better?

TL;DR Boss of a very small business is possibly terminally ill and the staff can no longer keep the company afloat in her absence. How can we help?"

First of all, I'm European, male, 26 years old, just gotten my Master's in Computer Sciences 2 months ago. I took 2 years longer than the rest of my peers, never really had straight A's and had to deal with a massive burnout in the last few months. Now I'm supposed to look for a job, but I haven't dared to send out my CV yet, as I'm just not convinced I'm really good at anything in this field. I know lots of things and can have very insightful moments, but I equally mess up immensely from time to time (something bad happened on my internship), so that has had a terrible effect on my confidence to apply for jobs requiring a MSc. degree. As you might have guessed, my self confidence is very, very low and that episode on the internship really shook me. IMO it wasn't even my fault, I got the blame though. Bad communication, even worse planning by the manager and him yelling obscenities instead of finding out what was going wrong were the root causes IMO. Also, I've only recently begun learning how to drive a car, while I'm making good progression, I can't yet go everywhere I want to go.

My skills are the following (From strongest to weakest):

 
C#, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, XML, Java, Android, HTML5, JSON, REST and SOAP webservices, C++, Wordpress, Drupal, QT, WP7.5

Since my internship my main focus has shifted towards Android/Java on Ubuntu rather than web development.

Furthermore I do know my way around in OO-programming and have a good understanding of Software Design Patterns and Project Management.


From the looks of it, it's more a psychological issue than a skill-related issue, anyone else have experience with this? How do you deal with it?


Any advice is welcome!"
zbzxa,0,2012-09-04,So I broke up with my girlfriend after 4 years when she was abroad and now i deeply regret that decision.

From there on everything between us went straight downhill. It began with her doubting of being still in love with me followed by me losing faith in our whole relationship.
Long story short: we broke up 2 and a half months into her internship.
A fews days after that i started to realise this was a big mistake (at least for me) and now I'm going to try getting her back when her internship ends next month.

Within my circle of friends this created some kind of controversy since some of my friends fully support my attempts, others believe that getting back together never ends well and the rest stands in between.. That's why I decided to ask you reddit:



Do you think it is possible to get back together with a former love? Is it in the long term?

I moved away from new jersey to complete an internship in florida a few months ago. I have a long term (3 years) boyfriend [24] in NJ; we both decided that an open relationship would be the best for us while I was away for a year.

I started dating another guy [25] about a month after I moved here. I like being in a relationship more than just sleeping around. My boyfriend from home knew I started seeing this guy.

After about a month of dating this new guy, he turned into a stage 5 clinger. If I didn't answer his phone call, he would call me literally 10 more times, text me another 40 times, etc, and wouldn't stop until I called him back. If I texted him back, he would just blow up my phone until I called him. He was emotionally abusive with this, accusing me of cheating on him when I didn't answer, calling me a bitch, slut, whore etc, threatening to break up with me unless I called him.

I could put up with all of that. It was stressful, but I could just roll my eyes and forget about it. Now hes physically abusive. My long-term boyfriend doesn't know about the abuse, my roommates are starting to catch on.

I don't want to be in this relationship, but I'm terrified and I just don't know how to even go about getting out of an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. My long-term boyfriend and parents are coming to visit me in a month and I'm afraid what will happen if I'm still stuck in this relationship when they come.

Reddit, I ask for your help! I don't know anyone here other than my roommates, co-workers, and my abusive boyfriend. I have no one else to turn to. I do live in a gated apartment complex with security, so I do have some sort of safe-haven to turn to.

I really want to be kept busy and prove that I'm a hardworker, but I'm afraid that there just might not be a lot for me to do and I may end up a nuisance.

I've been working in a fast food restaurant for about six months now, starting in February. May-July, I was gone doing an internship, and my GM said she was so impressed with my work ethic that I had been approved for a raise upon my return. I've been back for a month, and my raise has not been instated. I wouldn't be too concerned, but my initial pay rate was $0.25 less per hour than it was supposed to be, and if you work after 9PM, you get a dollar more per hour, which also wasn't instated when I started working there.

The GM insists that she is too busy to talk about...anything, really, since we're understaffed. I get that, I really do. But I feel that if I'm not an assistant manager, PIC (Person in Charge), or a GM that I shouldn't be doing managerial things, like running a shift or taking inventory, if I'm barely making over minimum wage and only getting about 20 hrs a week. 

I've also started looking for new jobs because the management is just terrible. The company will tell you outright that they often promote people based on desperation, not merit. 

All things considered, how do I get my raise? I don't want the GM to think she's lost me just yet, because she won't give me what I want if she thinks I'll leave anyway. What do I do?

zbds8,1,2012-09-03,[UPDATE x3] School is kind of awesome! Week 3 from the 17 year old.,AndrogynousCharlie,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/zbds8/update_x3_school_is_kind_of_awesome_week_3_from/,"&gt;[First thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/x8dnv/possibly_going_to_school_soon_for_the_first_time/)

&gt;[Second thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ykpto/update_going_to_school_for_the_first_time_in_8_or/)

I am back! I wanted to do one last update for a long time, preferably a year from when I started school (August 23rd). There were some people who wanted me to do more updates so here I am! 

I found it kind of ironic that the day I decided I would update, I look on the side bar and find the orange link asking me to donate to Pencils of Promise. I just reaaally wasn't expecting that, haha.

Anyways, school thus far has been pretty fantastic. I'm doing really well in my Physical Science course, and I've actually made a few friends despite my initial and ongoing awkwardness. That's the long story short version.

Algebra isn't as tricky as I thought it would be. So far I'm having an easy enough time comprehending it; the only thing really holding me back is my need to use the calculator (They allow us to use one in class). Honestly if I didn't have that calculator I'd end up spending a really long time on one question.

But my Algebra teacher is really great, and he's helping me with my multiplication and division.

All of my classes are online and for right now I only have the one class. I believe later on they'll give me more courses to do (I have Physical Science A and Algebra I, though my paper tells me I also have World History A and Physical Science B) but I'm happy with what I have right now.

I'm actually really ahead in my Phys Sci coursework-- I've already completed the midterm! Because I can work at my own pace I'm able to get farther if I can, and I did. I got a low 80% on it, which I'm pretty happy with. Overall in my coursework I've been getting a high 80%, which I think is a B, but I'm really close to getting an A.

One thing I really wasn't expecting was the people. I honestly thought saying swag and nigga and YOLO was just a fad on the Internet-- little did I know, every person says it at my school. Whether it's in seriousness (""Damn, he's got swaaag!"") or to make fun of the people saying it seriously (""Hey SWAAG! YOLO OH MY GOD I'VE GOT SO MUCH SWAAAG!!!"") it's still pretty annoying. I think a lot of people own at least one t-shirt that says YOLO.

But I have, in fact, made a couple of friends and even more acquaintances. On the first day a girl walked up to me, asked me why I was sitting alone, and brought me into her little group. They're all pretty great, and so far aren't annoying in the SWAGGA-YOLO-NIGGA department.

I feel like this is still so surreal. Like, I'm waiting for something to go wrong, or for me to wake up or something. I've had so many dreams about going to school, about being this happy... The fact that it's happening is still dumbfounding to me. 

There was one moment where I was a little freaked out. One of the counselors was helping me figure out what I should have on my schedule (This took like, two days because they had none of my records) and her and the principal were talking about how odd it was that I didn't have to check into any school districts when I was home schooled. They had no record of me anywhere, but since they haven't mentioned anything to me about it again I guess they dropped it.

TIME FOR THE BULLET POINTS I LOVE SO MUCH!

* School is awesome, I absolutely love it. I'm really enjoying my classes (Well, except algebra. I doodle Pokemon in the time that the teacher isn't talking) and I'm overall enjoying the people. I honestly thought something horrible was going to go wrong once more, and that I wouldn't be able to go to school after all. But everything is pretty much perfect.

* I'm actually really loving my school, I mean, seriously. They have this after school thing where I can earn high school credits AND college credits (If I do well enough, anyways). It's an internship as a school aide, so within the next few months I'll be working in elementary schools with little kids, helping out the teacher with whatever they need me to do. I'm pretty excited about that, and you'll probably see me around Reddit on this name talking more about that in the appropriate threads. It seems like there's a ""What crazy stuff do kids say/do around you?"" thread every couple weeks so yeah.

* I'm expected to graduate next year if I can get enough credits. There's a CAHSEE in October that I'm going to take so that I won't have to take algebra anymore (Hopefully I'll pass, but it's totally fine if I don't since there will be more chances). My algebra teacher is going to be helping me a lot in getting ready to be able to pass or at least do really well, so that's why I feel confident that I'll do at least well enough to pass.

**TL;DR: School is amazing, I freaking love it! Riding the bus to school, my new friends, the school work, the after school stuff, hell, I even love the cafeteria food. I'm doing really well, and you can expect an update next year in August or if I somehow graduate earlier you can expect an update then. You may also see me around Reddit with funny/silly/strange/a little scary children stories from working as a teacher's aide.**"

It is all he talks about and cares about, and he recently started school and refuses to learn anything (He already knows everything!). He fights with my mom about the government constantly, trying to twist her words and manipulate her into agreeing with him or shaming her if she doesn't. He thinks the most recent hurricane was manmade and it is all he goes on about. 

-My father thinks literally everything is Obama's fault, LITERALLY EVERYTHING. I started making up things and he explained how they were all Obamas fault. I am sad that these kinds of people are voting.

-I have cervical dysplasia and I have to go get a ""hole punch procedure"" of my cervix to biopsy it to see if it went away. It hurts like fuck and I have to go to class and school right after (despite massive bleeding that occurs after I get this one as well as the pain) because no one will cover my shifts and I can't miss class. It probably didn't get any better because it is pretty advanced (CIN II and III) and I am going to have to get fertility ruining procedures at 23. 

-I have to pass a pee test with fake pee because I am a pothead and if I dont pass it I wont get any of my money back for the internship classes I signed up for at the community college. (This was all very last minute and I had no notice) I didn't get into grad school last year so I am trying again this year and this internship would help a lot.

-My boyfriend is sort of a ""loser"" so to speak. I love him a lot and he is a good boyfriend but he is depressed and doesn't care about anything but music and me. He doesn't care about his future or hygiene and it sucks dating someone who doesn't want to look good for me or take me out (even if we split the check he can't afford it) but we are very close and I am not a super material person so I find it hard to break up with him because he is a poor 22 year old. I am very attractive and smart and I get asked out a LOT by men who take care of themselve and have jobs (but they just aren't him, I love him a lot) and it is hard because I love him so much but I just wish he took care of himself. I told him all of this today and he said he would try but I don't want to make people have to change or grow up too soon because of me. Ugh.

-I have to pass and take the gre very soon

-My car is a death trap and I cannot afford a new one under any circumstances. 

-My jobs treat me like shit, like a dog. Get new ones you say? Easier said than done, especially between cervical cancer treatments and interning and going to class. They all pay like shit and shout at me and make me glad I have a degree so I don't have to deal with this shit forever.

zb97s,3,2012-09-03,girls my age don't seem to be attracted to me...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/zb97s/girls_my_age_dont_seem_to_be_attracted_to_me/,"So here's the deal...I am 24, I think I am handsome, 5'5'' 152lbs, I shave my head bald by choice, I exercise, I'm athletic, I have an internship with a great company, I have a BA, I am back in a trade school to get some extra training which I am doing very well in, and I have a great sense of humor.

The downsides to my situation are that I live at home with my grandma, I hit a rough patch bouncing between a few different jobs this past month so I don't have much money, I do not have any close friends that live near me, I have no girlfriend, there are no men in my family so I am constantly surrounded by women who hen peck me because I am the only guy, my Dad is super busy with two businesses so we rarely get time to hang out, my mom moved to 200 miles away when I was a kid.

So whenever I go out, and I try to meet a girl that is my age, I do not attract the attention that I want. The girls that I think could be interested in me are not, and it bums me out. It would be great to have the support of a significant other that is my age and has the same struggles. Unfortunately what seems to keep happening, is that I keep attracting older women, and not by choice. 

When I was younger and in college, I was enticed by the idea of a ""cougar"" but I am really not anymore, and I want to have a meaningful relationship. I had girlfriends in college, but now all I can seem to get is casual sex with cougars. Not all of them are great looking, or good in bed (many have this idea that these older women are awesome in bed and more experienced, hate to burst the bubble, but people are the same no matter what the age). 

I am working hard to get my money right and get my own place, but I feel like that is not really the problem. I feel like it is more the way I carry myself, I don't know why girls my age are not as into me, even when I go out and cold approach women, I feel like I am largely ignored. Maybe living with my grandma has aged my soul a little bit, and the hen pecking has hurt my confidence...maybe moving out will be better for me to get in touch with my young self again. 

 have been looking at other things like /r/confidence and /r/getmotivated which have helped, and I have been trying really hard to get it together.

I know this isn't the place to ask for advice, but this is a place for long rants....so I figured I could come here to get this off my chest.

I'm an intern for CenSoC (The Center for the Study of Choice) at the University of Technology, Sydney. We are currently doing a project involving various structures that implement ""Follow the Leader"" type dynamics. We look to see if the choices that people make are dependent on the influence of ""leaders"" in their community, and try to analyze why this is/is not an attribute of the community.

We would like to do some simple data mining through the Reddit API, since Reddit is already effectually a simple choice experiment (upvotes/downvotes). We were planning on collecting content and user data to see how they influence each other, however, we hit a snag:

If we try to request user info one at a time, with a 2 second delay between each, the time taken to collect all of the data would be overdrawn. We have been considering restructuring the data mining approach, but we also wanted to know if a patch would be simple enough to allow GET requests by_id. Something of this nature:
    


in the file which implements GET username about API:    

    /r2/r2/controllers/listingcontroller.py, line ~679

to go from something like this:
    

    def GET_about(self, vuser):

        ...

        return Reddit(content = Wrapped(vuser)).render()

        ...

to something like the following, where the username(s) url portion is split using regex (much like in the 'by_id' api code):

    reddit.com/user/userA,userB,userC/about.json

... and then looped on the server-side appending to the returned http response without having to re-initiate the http request/response every time:

    def GET_about(self, usernames):

        ...    
        splitter = re.compile('[ ,]+')    
        return Reddit(content = [Wrapped(x) for x in in splitter.split(usernames)]).render()    
        ...
    

obviously, the correct Python-syntax and various variable-validation in reddit arch. will be necessary, but the logic of the above, albeit incorrect Python-syntax-wise, remains.

    

Would something like this be feasible? We currently don't have any team members who are well-versed in Python, and we also don't know how things look on Reddit's end.

The internships are in Dhaka, Quezon City or New Delhi. Generally the applicant isn't able to choose the location (although you can specify preferences). I am mildly concerned about spending six months in Bangladesh but am a super inexperienced traveller (have never left North America) and have no idea if I'm being silly. 

I'm obviously not looking to take an internship as a way to look for hookups- I'm in a committed relationship here in Canada. The intention would be to not speak about sexuality one way or the other which seems like it wouldn't be terribly hard, but I'd be writing/calling my girlfriend fairly regularly so it's not as though there'd be no way for anyone to figure it out if they were already suspicious.

I think legally I would be fine there since from what I understand Bangladesh is relatively permissive as a state where homosexuality is illegal and I wouldn't actually be having gay sex at any point. I'm more concerned about other people threatening my safety and not having any recourse or allies. I want to travel to get out of my comfort zone but I don't want to be so out of my comfort zone that I feel unsafe for six months.

zekxj,25,2012-09-05,Career Dilemma: I don't want to do Graphic Design anymore. What now?,abqcub,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/zekxj/career_dilemma_i_dont_want_to_do_graphic_design/,"So here’s my dilemma and a little background. I received my Associates Degree in Graphic Design (emphasis in print) in ‘09 and was on the track to pursuing Graphic Design as a career and eventually work my way up the ranks to Creative Director or something similar. I knew how to use the software and was usually at the top of my class in terms of design skill. I wanted to pursue my education further so I’m currently working on my Bachelors in Advertising and Studio Art (Double Major) to fill in the holes that my Associates left out. I had it set in stone that this was going to be my life, and I couldn’t be more enthusiastic about it.

I’ve done the freelance thing, and also worked as an in-house Designer/Prepress for a local print shop, and now currently work as a Marketing Intern at the University. All this “real world” experience has taught me that I don’t think I’m cut out to be a designer, or rather it’s something I no longer wish to pursue because its taken a negative impact on my life.

This idea is mostly due to the fact that dealing with clients and my boss in regards to designing has left me feeling incredibly frustrated everyday. I know dealing with said people is part of the job and there’s no way to get around it, and that as designers we just suck it up and learn to deal with frustrating people while at the same time working on our communication skills to convince the client that as an experienced professional we know what's best and thats why we were hired. 

What's happened now is that all the creativity and inspiration has just been sucked out of me. Designing has become a chore, and I find myself blatantly ripping off others designs just to churn out work and get the project over with. There’s no more enthusiasm, no more sense of accomplishment, just an empty feeling that leaves me staring at a blank InDesign document.

So I graduate in December and I’ve come to the conclusion that what I enjoyed was the innovation, thinking outside the box, and fitting all the puzzle pieces together in a design. The more artistic part has just been something I don’t care to pursue anymore. 

Now the big question is what do I do with all this education and training? How can I transition from Graphic Designer to something else? How do I market these skills to take my career in a different direction? I ask you wonderful people of reddit if you have any experience or advice that could send me in a new direction. Any ideas for jobs or areas of interest that I can focus on? I know no job is perfect, and there's always going to be bad days and bad people to work with, but I think I can do a little better than the rut I’m in now. So please save the negativity and criticism I see so much on here, I’m really facing a daunting life change.


**tl;dr** - Spent six years wanting to be a Graphic Designer, but no longer feel the same. Now I don't know what I want to be when I grow up, and I graduate in four months and want to hit the ground running. What do I do with all my experience? 

***update*** -  I appreciate all the outpouring of support, I really do, but I would like to discuss more alternatives to a career in design. I know my employers suck and that it's not all like that, and that I just need to find inspiration to keep me going. I just don't feel like this is the right path for me, but I don't want to waste all the time and money I sank into school and jobs

***Update 02/07/2013***
*Apparently people are still finding this, so I'm posting my latest response to user clydefrogforever which I think wraps up this post:*

Wow, I'm surprised people are still finding and replying to this.

Thanks for all the support and kind words, but as you can probably see from the rest of the post I've made up my mind. Recent developments since this post have been that I did graduate and had to resign my position as the Marketing Intern since I'm no longer a student. I've spent 2 months job searching and living off savings. I applied for many positions, mostly marketing but a few design positions as well. The design positions were more light work, such as doing book layout and cover illustration, real easy stuff.

I received nothing besides ""we regret to inform you"" messages, had a grand total of three portfolio views, granted my portfolio was thrown together and doesn't have nearly enough examples which is completely my fault. There's no market in my area, and my state (New Mexico) is ranked among the highest for unemployment, and ranks lowest in new job creation. I've applied to jobs in other states but with no luck because I figure most are trying to hire local and quickly. I also have the added disadvantage of looking like some 21-22 yr old kid who just graduated, because I indeed did just graduate. What doesn't carry through is that I'm 27, which may not seem like a big deal but it can work in my advantage that I'm older and possibly have more experience than a typical recent grad, and indeed I do have more experience than most of my graduating class in the same fields.

**End of story now;** I ran out of savings to live off of and just need to pay bills, so yesterday I interviewed to be a Barista at Starbucks. I figure its pretty much a given job right now because my partner is a well respected employee at the hotel the Starbucks is licensed and housed in. The company is really big on promoting from within and so far just from the interviews I impressed everyone with my knowledge and drive for furthering my career. While this hotel does not have a marketing department due to budget constraints, I hope to work my way into the small amount of marketing they have and eventually move to another hotel that does have a better marketing department.

Is this what I had in mind when I set out to push myself in school? No, not at all. It took some time to realize that this may be the best way to start a career. Start out in the mail room if you catch that old saying. This economy and job market is awful. I had high and unrealistic expectations. My lack of desire to keep designing bled out into a desire to not want to do anything anymore and made my life and dreams crumble. I picked my ass up though and reprioritized what was important. In a few days I'll hopefully have a job, I have a partner who cares for me, friends who care for me, I realized I'm in the same situation as many of my peers and people with much more skill than me. I think if I just work hard, show people what I can do, open my mind to different possibilities as far as a career, then I'll be fine. I'm optimistic about the future, even if its not my dream job.

Sometimes you just need to move on, and maybe that thing you thought you wanted so bad was just getting in the way of something better. "
zek8v,8,2012-09-05,I never thought I would be this mad at you.,pissinthewind,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/zek8v/i_never_thought_i_would_be_this_mad_at_you/,"Now that it's over its easy to chastise myself for making the mistake of getting back together. You struggled with distance before, but you never betrayed me. You know my history, the last time I was in a serious relationship I was engaged, and when times got rough she gave me an ultimatum I couldn't accept. It wasn't cheating, but I thought of that as a betrayal. When we started you knew I was a forgiving person. I wasn't mad at my ex, but I told you that I have no tolerance for betrayal.

But you convinced me. We've known each other for two years now, and you said you hated denying what we were to each other. I loved you, you loved me,  and you were confident that after so much time thinking this way, that you could handle distance again. 

Then two nights ago happened. You go back to College, one closer to me, that I would be able to visit semi-regularly, at least. Things were looking good, you were away from the people that gave you so many problems, I have internship opportunities coming up soon, money coming in, we could have made it work. Instead you chose to spread your legs wide open on the very first goddamn night.

I'm not usually a mad person. I harbor no ill-will towards any of my exes. Except you, now. You were the first one to cheat on me, and that it was so easy for you. Or that you were so easy. Never in any other break-up in my life have I wanted to say so much more than ""Its all over"". I couldn't believe you had the gall to ask me where we stood, saying you and he both felt terrible. 

I have to admit, I thought I was prepared for this, not that you knew I was thinking that. Maybe that was part of the problem, maybe it would have just ended sooner if I had admitted a couple weeks ago that I was still worried you would succumb to temptation while you were away. But even I didn't think it would happen on the first night. 

I thought I could handle this, if it happened. I would just immediately move on, after all, there are plenty of good looking, nice girls in my classes at my own college, and this is my last year where it will really be this easy to meet new women. You've made me madder at a single person than I've ever been before. I never thought I could really think of someone as a lying cheating whore before, like I think of you. 

Whenever I do a voice in my head says that there are good things there, the same things I saw before. And most of them are still there, but I'll be damned if there worth anything now that you have ruined yourself. Sometimes I just hope you fuck all the guys on your floor, so they all know how easy you are, and that they should stay the fuck away. 

Why the hell am I so fucking mad at you?"
zejjr,0,2012-09-05,22F moving in with 23M. How do I avoid making current roommates and parents angry about my decision? ,roseangela13,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zejjr/22f_moving_in_with_23m_how_do_i_avoid_making/,"I [22F] have been dating my [23M] boyfriend for almost 3 years. We both graduated college in May. I've been living in a house my parents own and bought for me to live in while attending school. Since I graduated, I've been paying rent. I have two roommates: one ex-best friend turned acquaintance for unrelated reasons and one current best friend who both also pay rent. 

Boyfriend was supposed to be away at an internship from July to October. Ended up finding a paid job so he came back early and just moved into his own place. He and I had planned on moving in together in December, but with the way things have changed, we'd like to move in together in October (he's going to have a tough time affording the place alone and I'm going to be starting a new well paying plus benefits job). 

Problem: I had told my parents and roommates I'd be living in the house until December. I don't want to piss anyone off. Pros for living with boyfriend: boyfriend's new place would be cheaper than what I pay now plus it's closer to my office. I also have been having a really tough time living with this ex-bestie turned acquaintance and my parents are extremely overbearing and I've been ready for a while to move out. I also have been ready to live with my boyfriend for a while. We have plans to get engaged within the next few months. However, I know my roommates feel that I have betrayed them and I have yet to talk to my parents about this change, and am not ready for their wrath. 

Extra info: I have a sister who will be moving in in December with her own roommates, so me moving out in December was inevitable anyways. Both current roommates are moving out in December. Parents don't make a profit on the house, so roommates' rent won't go up.

Any suggestions? I also don't want to make my boyfriend's life harder or make him feel shoved aside by not moving in with him now (as he wants). 

TL;DR: Moving out of house earlier than planned to move in with boyfriend. How do I not piss off roommates and parents (homeowners)? "
zeefl,1,2012-09-05,For-Profit School Bounceback?,Envoke,ITdept,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITdept/comments/zeefl/forprofit_school_bounceback/,"So, /r/ITdept, I was the unfortunate victim of a bad experience at a state university, and ended up at a for-profit school, which will remain unnamed. Let me give you guys a little backstory.

I went to the state college and attempted a comp-sci degree. Unfortunately, they focused on the programming and software engineering aspect of comp. sci, and offered little to no lab or hands on courses that let you delve into the networking or actual physical aspect of IT. It was extremely math-heavy on the front end, and after speaking with the chair of that department, was told that any hands-on or physical classes took place senior year as internships only.

I was hurt, because I'm not a programmer, and really find myself hitting a brick wall when it comes to the stuff, and ended up changing to a different major, then having to pull out of school a year later due to financial issues.

Cut to 2 years ago. I enrolled in a local for-profit university, mainly because I was guaranteed financial aid, and 2 years later graduated top of my class with an associates, and a+ cert. My teachers all worked in the field, and I got a great education from the place; I got a job working the help desk at a massachusetts based healthcare organization, and couldn't be happier. Sure, I'm in an assload of debt, but it got me to where I wanted with the knowledge I need.

Now though, I find myself at this crossroad. I really want to go back to school, and after calling a couple colleges and investigating online, found that none of my associates credits will transfer, and theres nothing I can do about it. I can go back to the for-profit school and deal with the fact that I'll be facing Harvard-like financial burden for a bachelors degree, or I can start over at a state or private university in MA.

What do you, the IT professions of Reddit recommend for someone like me? I love the hands on, troubleshooting aspect, and server management, but when it comes to general software engineering, I could never be a script monkey. I know I will eventually need to learn code to do basic functions, and I'm willing to accept that, but I can't do that for a living. What programs do you guys recommend? Do I just suck it up and go straight comp-sci and be unhappy doing the programming for the 4 years while I get my shit together, but have an applicable degree, go back to the for-profit and learn the hands-on lab stuff I want, or are there alternate programs available that I'm just not seeing?

Thanks for any help :)"

I am a college student struggling to get by while finishing up my last semester at my university. I had to do a required (yet unpaid) internship this summer (360 hours total!) and haven't had a paycheck since May. I have been living off of food from the food pantry and a local organization that offers a free meal every night because I was not able to work this entire summer. (I worked 48 hours a week at the internship to get it finished in time). 

The birth control will help me immensely. I have been meaning to get back onto birth control for a while now...but I haven't had even 25 dollars for a co-pay on a consultation at PP. I had been on Ortho Tri Cyclen in the past with only mild side effects (Slight mood changes), so this is perfect.

Thank you again, Dinosaurtits. I really, really appreciate this. I hope I can return this favor to another woman in need someday! Thank you so much!!"

A classmate and I are both coming to Norfolk to complete an internship at ODU. The internship is October through February, and we need to find housing. So i understand finding somewhere to rent on a month to month basis probably isn't the easiest. Sub-leasing from someone would be fantastic however it's not an ideal time so i don't know if that's possible. Also i think we were hoping to find somewhere pre-furnished as 5 months is hardly worth moving furniture from 7 hours  away. So the pre-furnished deal isn't as high a priority as just somewhere that's month to month or perhaps does 6 month leases that don't coincide with school semesters. Anyways I'd appreciate any advice or places to check out that you guys know. Also i will know no one other than my classmate, so if I have some free time i'd love to come to a meet-up or meet with some people at a bar, watch some football, maybe catch a show or something. Thanks a bunch."

Shaniqua and I met a few months ago, we really hit it off great. We get along well, laugh together all the time, and we have about 95% of the same interests. In an ideal world, we would have been dating, but about two weeks into knowing Shaniqua, I found out she had a boyfriend of three years.

Often times we would spend 10-12 hours a day together. For a while, we would always hang out, but her boyfriend would always be around too. It's not that her boyfriend made me uncomfortable, he's a decent human being...but it really sucked because of how I felt about her. It was almost like I was getting teased. I mean...wouldn't you guys hate being around the person you're crushing hard on, as well as their SO? It's just sucky.

Because it was harder to keep it in than it would be to face the consequences of telling her, I told her how I felt. I also told her that I felt as if I was getting some mixed signals. I stressed that I was expecting nothing, I just needed to get it off my chest. I also told her fully well knowing that this might be the end of my friendship, and was willing to accept that if need be.

She wasn't upset at all...she was very understanding, and said that she wouldn't let anything get in the way of our current relationship. She also immediately told her boyfriend. The eerie thing is that neither of them were upset. Her boyfriend was like, ""yea it's cool dude I would have told her too...wanna hang out?"" Like, wat? Is this guy even a guy? I'm not really friends with him in the first place. Anyway, I digress...

She had told me in a different world things would be different between us, but she just can't drop her boyfriend for someone she recently met. I understand that. I get it, really, I do. I wouldn't want her to, because then it would make me paranoid.

Anyway, since she stopped being an intern at where I work, I have seen her a lot less. We text and chat once in a while, but it's not the same, which is probably for the best. I've been happy about things for a while now after a brief really sucky period, but just the other day she texted me wanting to go out for some dinner and hang out time later this week. 

Without even thinking, I said I would love to and setup a date and time. I haven't seen her in two weeks, but as much as I want to, I know I shouldn't. I know it's disrespectful to her, her boyfriend, as well as myself for seeing her when I know I still have feelings for her. I know that, in a relationship, **we would never be compatible** because she values religion so much, and I could honestly give two fucks. I know all this, yet the burning desire is there and it's hard to handle.

Now I know that the right thing for me to do would be to call this off, because I've already made it clear that being ""just friends"" with this woman is just going to be too difficult.

Women of reddit, why is the right thing to do so hard?

**TL;DR: Met amazing girl, girl has boyfriend, get mixed signals, tell her how I felt not expecting anything, we distance a little while then she keeps asking me to hang out...I reluctantly say yes but know I should have said no and need to stop contact**"

3. Where would you look for a contact?

4. Are internships usually payed in Australia? And if so, what would be a rough amount?

5. I am fluent in speaking and writing in English, French and German. But would I need to officially certify that (apart from my school graduation)?

6. What is a key feature a company would look for? For example in my country experiences abroad and things you did besides studying are a huge key feature. Grades usually aren't that important.

zdwkc,2,2012-09-05,My mom is really pushing for me to get a real estate license. Should I? I'm 22.,GoshaNinja,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zdwkc/my_mom_is_really_pushing_for_me_to_get_a_real/,"Once again, 22. I work part-time as a cashier and I intern for a local paper, because my major is print journalism (YEAH WHATEVER MAN IT'S FUN)

I'll be graduating after this semester, but my mom's been really wanting me to get a real estate license. She keeps talking about how we're so close to paying down the mortgage and how things will get so much better, because right now, we aren't doing so great. Also, my dad's a dick and he's dicking around somewhere else, so there's the answer to that question.

She's said she's sold a couple houses already, but she's also in the middle of obtaining her license (Also, I don't get how she's doing that, but she's made some bank from it.) and it's not really a matter of me wanting to do this or not, because while I'm indifferent about the license itself, I really, really like the thought of not having a mortgage not hanging over our heads for the next 60 or so months. And, I don't know, if I accidentally make this my career, then well, either I'll like it enough to keep doing it or I'll kill myself, so there.

So, I guess a couple key questions:

1. Is this viable? How much sense is my mom making?
2. She keeps saying it'll be something I can do on the side. How would be able to do it on the side? What the fuck, or is there a scenario where I do it on the side?
3. Any more personal insight?

This is pretty early, because I literally just talked to her an hour ago about this, but this was as serious as that conversation has gotten. I'll be looking into it plenty, but I'd like some thoughts directly from people who are doing this now."

Still having Annie on the brain, but trying to not ""obsess"" about it, I invited our mutual friend over to my place for a little friendly gathering. The night came and so did Annie with our friend, needless to say I was ecstatic!!! We talked during the night, and I kept getting absorbed by her every word. She just seemed like one of the most interesting people I'd met in a long long time. At the end of the night I just up and asked her if I could be so bold as to ask her out to dinner, she gave me a huge smile, said yes, and gave me a big hug. I ended up calling her and making plans for the upcoming Saturday. She ended up twisting her ankle during the week, so we rescheduled for the Sunday.

An arrow scroll shot into your intern's chest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63flxa?context=5)|People's Daily Newspaper publicly identified me as ""an enemy of the people"".

Who or what has the most of decision power or influence which changes the future of the US?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63etx8?context=5)|People - definitely.  Never doubt that.  I have seen a congressman make a 3 star general wait in the lobby because the head of the local PTA was visiting.  
[Knowing what you know, are you more hopeful for the future or fearful? And is there a mind blowing tidbit of knowledge that you actually are able to share. (Just a small tiny crumb will do\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63eqv1?context=5)|Fearful in the short term (2 decades); hopeful after that.  Global reach is expanding.  There is going to be some friction.  With destructive power going up that means people are going to die.  But hopefully, after some time and exposure we all learn to live with each other a bit more.  As long as people keep thinking every meteorite shower is a message from God we are going to have problems.

Great comment.  I don't think anyone wants conflict.  The issue is going to be whether we can manage a peaceful rise of China.  Remember there are factions in EVERY government.  Military, diplomatic, intelligence, legislative, etc.  It's like a car speeding down the highway with everybody grabbing at the wheel. Sometimes you slide into conflict; sometime you can manage your way out of it.

I'm not so sure it is a superpower issue.  Clearly the rise of China is a big issue.  Friction between the developed and developing world (exacerbated by extremist religions) is going to be with us for a while.      
[Most people believe China will become a superpower soon, however some historians think because of the high income inequality (along with a range of other reasons\) China's growth is unsustainable and will crash soon.

Seriously, that is the big question.  Most of China's leadership is clueless on the answer.

But a superpower is more than an economy and military.  Great nations must export ideas.  That is ultimately why the Soviet Union crumbled.  People just didn't like what they had to offer.  This is also China's problem for the future.
[The more we use them for cheap labor, the sooner we are enabling them to surpass us by not only pumping money into their economy and out of ours, but every worker we hire there must meet a certain level of qualification. We are building them up from the bottom and middle out while lying to our own country with this trickle down bullshit.  How long can this continue before chinas middle class becomes as complacent as our and they start exporting jobs to here for cheap labor from our growing number of slums.  Isn't our education system already behind them and plenty of other countries if you don't account for college levels? How long can we do that until the affects are too difficult to reverse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63vlau?context=5)|I think they are a ways from the scenario you've developed.  The CPC has been trying very hard to develop an internal economic infrastructure to develop domestic consumer demand.  But they really don't have a middle class yet.  Our educational systems suffers but it is not because of lack of resources, teacher pay or some other crap.  We pay more per student (K-12) than any other nation.  It is a cultural issue that is hurting us.
[Interesting, I have always heard China is the poised to be the next superpower, with India starting to head in that direction.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63tb71?context=5)|Define super power for me?  Most people are very limited in their definition - GNP.  Even if China's economy surged past ours their (larger) population would (per capita) probably be making only 1/5th of what the average US workers makes.  They have a few decades before they will be a blue water navy, so they have very limited force projection capabilities. They have no appealing political model.  Certainly no judicial model anyone would wants (other than dictators).  It is anyone's guess as to what their economic model will look like.  For any country to be considered a global power all these aspects will play a role.  India is pretty far behind as well.
[I read a lot of articles and watched a few documentaries about how first world countries will ultimately end up in conflict over fresh water supply, which is obviously critical for human survival. We've already seen the impact of natural resources on international tension (primarily oil obviously\), and most of the reasoning seems sound, but I don't generally hear about people who are concerned about this.  Is this something you agree will generate political tension between major powers in the near future? If so, are you willing to say how you think that might play out? And if not, can you explain why you think it's not a valid concern? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63fd10?context=5)|Fresh water is going to be a concern for the near future.

There will always be an evolving set of defenses and new offensive techniques.  I speculate this will be the future of warfare along with advanced robotics.  People are getting very tired of shedding their blood (of that of their kids/parents etc.).  We will move towards forms of conflict that allow us (everyone) to wage war with minimal loss of one's own population. Cyber is in the lead here.

Since this is a documented public incident, I accept it as fact.  With that admission, I'll just cut to it: in your opinion, are off-planet cultures monitoring the United States Space Program?

I am a pretty likeable guy, and am capable of forming connections and talking to people very very easily, so basically I have better than average networking skills.  Over the years, I have found I am better at applicable work rather than book studying.  For example, I have participate in several case competitions and have done well in all of them, including the Deloitte consulting one in which our team won.  I have had a lot of work experience from (legit) internships and even have a reference from the company CEO; many hedge funds and Fortune 500 companies are our clients.

A few weeks later I went on a pre-planned trip to see her. Things were absolutely amazing for both of us. After the trip, we started the break. The summer was great for her. She met a ton of new friends and started dating a guy out there. We had planned on getting back together from the conception of the idea. Now, two-months after I visited her, she has returned. She's unsure if she wants to pick things back up because she felt something for someone else and because she's interested in taking a year LOA from school to travel abroad.

I should say that when we were together, everything was perfect. We never fought and everyday was full of laughs and interesting conversation.

I think that since what we had was so great that we should finish off this semester strong. I want her to be happy and I want her to adventure and explore but I really think that we should end things between us right.

Should I fight for us or should I just shrug off the best relationship of my life?

At the moment I am a junior and am stuck in the ""experience needed for experience"" continuum. I wasn't able to land an internship/co-op last summer which I believe had a lot to do with my almost barren resume. 

I got my resume critiqued by an aerospace recruiter today and the first thing he told me was ""where is all of your experience, surely you have more."" It really got me down since the reason I am revising my resume is to try and get some experience in the aerospace field. I'm going to an internship fair next week, but I feel my lack of experience will be a turn-off for recruiters. At the moment I only have relevant projects and one job (math TA) listed, but literally have nothing else. For some more background info, I have a good GPA (around 3.61) and am only a regular member of a few activities which I hold no significant positions in.


**TL;DR:** Have very little experience and am finding it hard to stand out for internships.

So how have some of you gotten past this no experience problem when dealing with internships/jobs/co-ops?"

Career (or lack thereof) and Love (or lack thereof)

I was dumped 2 months ago. It wasn't a super long relationship; 8 months, but he was the ideal boyfriend. I was in love quite quickly, he didn't say it back but that was fine, he had been in bad relationships in the past and I would rather him wait til he meant it. I stayed at his house 5-6 nights a week, we never had a fight. I was such a good girlfriend, I gave him space when he needed it, was there when he needed it, had awesome sex.   Things were going so well, until his company had to move across the company.  He was going, and he still didn't love me so I wasn't invited. Understandable, but hard to hear. How does someone you put so much time and effort into loving ( and enjoyed every minute of it) just never love you back, and once you break up, doesn't miss it at all. 
It sucks to not have him, or another romantic interest, but the main thing is I don't know what I am doing with my life, and he was a great distraction. After a couple weeks of moping I took on more jobs (i now have 4 including one unpaid internship) I made my apartment look awesome, but these things aren't helping. I wish I had a passion I could build a career around, or just find one full time job to get by and not stress and find a hobby, but im just lost. I don't know what to do and it hurls me into this pit of sadness and anxiety that is so hard to climb out of, all i do is cry, I want to talk to someone, but I don't want to freak out all of my friends or family. 
When I am riding my bike, or running, I take unnecessary risks because I think I will feel better if I am seriously hospitalized, because then i dont need to have a plan for awhile. I feel better when I am sick. 
The one exception is the physical pain of freaking out so hard and being so sad it takes away your breath and hurts your chest. "
zd9vu,2,2012-09-04,I'm unhappy in my relationship. But I'm not throwing in the towel yet. (Wall of Text incoming!),badjellydawitch,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/zd9vu/im_unhappy_in_my_relationship_but_im_not_throwing/,"We've been going out for two years, one of which was in a long-distance relationship. She has some pretty big insecurities physically, which were not helped by me looking up porn, saying that I check out other girls etc. (The latter was when I was unaware of these issues, the former has happened several times.)

Call it a hunch, but I believe 90% of the issues we have stem from this. She gets really worked up over small things (leaving a few crumbs on the counter, for example), has called me a ""fucking idiot"", as well as ""disgusting"", ""untrustworthy"", and other similar terms (the last two related to busted-watching-porn issues.) She got angry with me when I told her that I was loving my intern job back home, and that I might take them up on the offer if they gave me a full-time job. (Dream job.) She was adamant that I'd move to her since she was going to apply for her dream job, but she wouldn't do the same for me. She didn't get her dream job in the end; I was offered mine but I turned it down to live with her. Something I kick myself over way too fucking much.

I help her out at her work every morning before I go to mine. I don't get paid a dime, and it's often here where she gets really mad at me over little things.

Granted, I'm not perfect. When she came back from a flight in the weekend, I was absent-minded, and didn't offer to take her bags for her. Not only that, but I left my wallet in the car, so she had to pay for that. (I paid her back, but that seems to be beside the point). I kept getting busted with the porn thing - and although I believe it's not a big deal personally, I gave it up. (/r/nofap was the lynchpin to this, the potential of an improved relationship was more of a plus than a driving factor. I simply wanted to make the most of my time instead of fap. To each their own.)

Having said that, we've both done some awesome things for each other. I brought her to tears when I gave her her first Valentine's Day gift, and her parents were kind enough to fly me overseas with her family for a holiday. She's supportive of my goals (I'm guessing, provided I don't move away). If you're actually reading this, you're a fucking champion. I feel like you care, and that makes me happy. I do my best to bring her up emotionally, although I'm struggling in that department.

But it's more bad than good at the moment. She doesn't listen when I mention something she's doing when she's bugging me - she keeps going, like a naughty kid until I have to really put the foot down. Although she gets frustrated with me over little things, when I (jokingly) rib her over something she does, which is not often, she gets mad and insults me. Since she last caught me with porn, there's been no sex. She says she's not ready (which could well be honest, but it still makes it hard (*heh*), especially with nofap).

And I'm falling into not caring. I've been fantasizing over a mutual friend for the last week and a half. When she's nice to me, all I'm thinking about is when the next big episode is going to happen. I'm legitimately happier when she's not around. I want to break up with her, but I feel like I'd be that guy who destroyed her self-image with porn, then said later. And I hate myself for it.



But you know what? I'm not ready to quit yet. The way I see it, is I've been letting her step on me all this time. No, she shouldn't be doing it in the first place, but I should also have the power to firmly say, ""I'm not cool with that."" I should be able to calmly state my issue and listen to what she has to say in response (provided it's mature), as opposed to weakly telling her to stop. I should be able to walk away when I think she's truly being disrespectful.

So here's my plan. I am going to find out if the change lies in me or in her. I'm going to be the guy she fell in love with again. (Luckily, nofap has already helped in this somewhat.) I'm going to be more sociable all-round, I'm going to be kind to my girlfriend (because **I do love her**), and I'm also going to stand my ground when I think she's acting muffed up.

If I can successfully do that, and she becomes the girl I fell in love with again, then that's AWESOME. I'll be a happy man.
If she doesn't change, or if she gets worse, I'll know I didn't walk away at the first sign of struggle. I'll know I gave it as much effort as I was willing to give, and that it wasn't enough. And I'll be able to walk away with a clear mind.

**WHEW**. I feel good now. By the way, I'm happy to talk about whatever. :P"

I did well in school, won a few writing competitions, ended up being commencement speaker, found a lot of validation, yada, yada, yada, great success woo. 

I live in LA now. I don't love movies or television but I moved here because family member had serious connections in the entertainment industry. 

It didn’t pan out. I was naive, assuming the barriers for entry would be lower for me. I don't like television or movies nearly enough to slog the shit that needs slogging, the shit covering the road to a television writing gig. 

No thanks. 

I've been writing, one freelance article for a small magazine in the Northwest, but mostly for myself - a few short stories that still need finishing, but… no one demanding them, I'm not finishing them! (fuck you, brain.) 

I'm paralyzed by my anxiety. I'm anxious because nothing is going on and there's no structure to my days and  I don't see an end for it either as I don't know what I could be be good at aside from writing. I'm not trained for anything else and it’s not like I’m a David Foster Wallace or a Cormac McCarthy exploding with a talent that the whole world notices. 

I don't have a clear sense of where to put my focus, what I should be aiming for. I'm not even sure if I should be Los Angeles if I'm not trying to do Hollywood. If I could get a job writing for a magazine that would be great but be realistic - it’s not going to happen except for freelance. 

That doesn’t work - freelance doesn’t structure your days and freelance needs constant self-starting motivation. On top of that, there’s no consistency. I need structure. I need something consistent. 

I guess there’s options out there - well, sort of - not really without the qualifications but I don't know what kind of job I should even be trying to get, what kind of job that will lead me to something I won't hate (the only hobbies that survived more than a brief love affair: writing, reading, music, pot, and magic cards). More importantly, a job I can actually get with my experience, which is limited to having worked on a lit magazine, co-founded another on my own, and writing for a PR agency as an intern. 

I'd really like some advice, Reddit. 

I know that I'm not in any rush. I'm only 22 but I need to find something to base my days around, something to give me structure. Hey, maybe even something that will teach me a useful thing or two. I don't know what I'm interested in; I haven't tried enough stuff. But I’ll tell you: I’d really like to walk down a road and get to the end of it instead of just hopping off in the middle, embarrassing myself in front of expectations.

TL;DR - ADD combined, closer to inattention - plus anxiety. I don't know what to do because I'm anxious, under-qualified, and ignorant of my options.

zgybz,5,2012-09-06,I just got hired as a sales counselor at a major gym. I've been here 2 days and I already hate it. Is it just me or do other people hate the sales model at most of these places? Rant inside as well.,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/zgybz/i_just_got_hired_as_a_sales_counselor_at_a_major/,"First and foremost I value health and fitness very much. I believe that a healthy and active lifestyle can truly change people's lives for the better.

I've never really liked sales though my dad says I would be amazing at it. I don't know what it is, I just don't like it. But, I thought if I'm selling health and fitness to people who need it and can benefit from it, it thought it would be ok. WRONG! 

Its not about health and fitness it's about the green stuff an it's about making people spend money they may or may not have so that I can make commission. Which I think unethical. I just can't get behind this system. Especially since I personally got healthy and fit at home without spending and extra dime at a gym. Now, I understand that not everyone has the motivation and the tools to do what I did, but I still can't do it.

Sorry, that was a bit of a scattered rant. Any thoughts, suggestions, stories or whatever are welcome.

Ps: it really sucks because for the time being I REALLY need this job. Though I am actively working on getting something else.

UPDATE:
Fixed a typo. 

 I quit the job. It was just too much for me. It all felt horribly wrong. They essentially wanted me to lie my way into convincing people to buy memberships. I don't want to go into details about but it wasn't just about being uncomfortable. The straw that broke the camels back was when they essentially demanded I make cold calls (which is fine) and give my personal phone number to be reached at by potential customers. They were 1. Not paying me nearly enough to make that worth it and 2. I verbally said I was not comfortable with that and they kept pushing me to do it anyway, which I find extremely unprofessional. 

UPDATE 2: Life works in some funny ways. Since I quit the job yesterday, I got a call from an internship I've been REALLY hoping for for about 2 weeks now. I GOT IT! What's crazy is that if I'd kept the job I would have not been able to take the internship. So I'm incredibly excited for whatever life has in store or me. I know I'll get another job soon. LIFE IS GOOD!"

How do I get through this?",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zgxip/just_finished_the_incredibly_discouraging_move/,"I graduated with a bachelors degree in May, and I over the summer I worked two internships, while simultaneously applying for jobs LITERALLY every day. The internships did both offer to hire me for freelance, but ultimately it just wasn't enough to sustain a lifestyle at this point in time.

Anyway, it appears that everytime I get a response from an application, they ask me a question, (""would you like to come in for an interview?"" / ""are you willing to relocate?"") I've always answered immediately- and then hear NOTHING from them. I give it a day or two and follow up with another email, and by 1 week I give a phone call. In the three instances where this has happened, the positions have been filled.

A. How is it that out of 100's of resumes I've sent, barely anyone gets back to me?

B. Should I be more aggressive about the people who do seem to get back to me? (since they always seem to flake)

C. would anyone be willing to take a look at my [resume / (general) cover letter / and portfolio](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B-ab1NEYOrF3QnU4eUY1X1lOQVE) and give me feedback? I really don't have anyone to turn to, as no one in my family is working within the field that I would like to.

D. Does anyone have any tips on how to start creating a network in a new location?

I would really appreciate it if anybody could get back to me.... I just had to move out of the city I love and move home to live with my parents. I'm still young, and I know it's normal. But, it sucks. It feels shitty. And I know there's a lot of people out there who can relate.

The point of this post is: Don't go looking for jobs in March, because the positions get filled **NOW**


Most companies that I worked for, would post their campus recruitment adds in early september, interview in late sept/early october and send out offers by the end of october.


These would be STEM type jobs, but nearly any summer corporate internship type job likely does the same.  Most of the interviews were behavioral based.  We weren't looking for people who actually KNEW very much - we were looking for people with the right attitude who were progressing through programs which would eventually yield enough knowledge to work with.

Generally, if you're a student, applying for your first office/profession job expect mostly behavioural questsion. Have prepared examples and answers for questions regarding:

- when you've shown initiative
- when you've dealt with conflict
- when you've worked in a team, and your role
- what courses you enjoy/do not enjoy in school
- how you keep yourself organized at work/school
- what helps you unwind, what you do to relax
- what do you want out of a company, what do you see as a good work environment
- what do you know about my company/my industry
- why are you interested in pursuing a carreer

Try not to relate EVERYTHING back to a class project, or a group presentation.  Try to vary your responses over some volunteer work, or a previous job even if it was unrelated to the field.  Don't try and sound like you ONLY go to school.

A ""good"" interview, from my end anyway, is one in which these questions do not actually get asked. A good interview is one where it turns into a conversation with some back and forth, around these topics and the result is that they all get answered. Communication skills are key, so try and not be nervous.

TL:DR **start checking your campus recruitment office's website daily for jobs in your field, not getting an internship will really hurt your chances finding a full time job after you graduate, and lots of people dont know that most jobs, which start next summer, are POSTED VERY SOON**

Should I put a VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE heading and just have the one position in it? Should I create a VOLUNTEER WORK AND INTERNSHIPS heading and include both categories under there? Or can it go under WORK EXPERIENCE, even though it's not paid (also, my internships are currently under that heading)?"

zgjiq,0,2012-09-06,"Reddit, let's talk about work -- what would you want to do for a living, if you could push aside all financial considerations? What do you think about the work-life divide? What do you think the future of the working world will look like?",januarysnow,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zgjiq/reddit_lets_talk_about_work_what_would_you_want/,"EDIT: Briefly jotted down my opinions on the three questions I put forth. Will expand later, perhaps.

I am asking this question from a cubicle. I'm much more interested on what you guys have to say about these questions, but I may come back and express my opinions at a later time.


II. So, I feel somewhat ambivalent about the work-life divide. In a sense, it suggests that ""work"" is necessary a separate entity from ""life"", and I think that's troubling considering it's something that takes up at least a fourth of the day for most people. We talk about ""work-life balance"" as though the two have fixed value judgements attached to them: work is a necessary evil -- a thing that we must do because it enables us to enjoy the things that ""life"" has to offer, like spending time with our family and friends. So maybe someone who is (forgive the Marxian term) unalienated from their labor (people who are their own bosses come to mind) see work as part of rather than the antithesis to life?


III. I'm not sure, but the current situation doesn't quite seem stable. Baseline qualifications keep getting higher and higher, and all we do is keep working harder. I've worked several jobs steadily since entering college and have held internships or research positions every summer since the summer before college. I think I'm the type of Millennial that older generations like to point to and say, ""See? If you did this instead of camping out in a park for five days without showering, you might actually have a job."" But what is it all worth if the job ends up being something that is unfulfilling? Can everybody work jobs that they care about? Is self-actualization something Western civilization cooked up during the Enlightenment that we keep chasing, but feel unhappy about because we can never reach it? My head is swimming."

My hope with this AMA is to inspire some of you to take a risk, start a business, and use time and smart budgeting techniques to travel and see the world. This is my life.

After graduating from my state university, I worked a cubicle job as an engineer. I found that I wasn't happy going to work every day, so I gave my 2 weeks notice and quit. I knew a little bit of HTML, taught myself how to program (PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, ASP.NET, CSS, etc.) and started my first business as a web developer. I managed to find some clients who let me work on their websites. Every website I made I tried to teach myself a new programming language.

Despite making an average income, I had more freedom and time, and make my own schedule. Using this, I began travelling, and have gone on about 50 trips/vacations since I started counting years ago. I go on about 8+ a year, which range from weekend camping trips to US cross-country driving adventures to months in Japan and India. I also had enough savings to go to law school for fun (not the best idea). I am able to budget my income in such a way that I can travel often and lead a life of crazy adventures.

After a few years of finding and managing clients and building websites, I co-founded a new ad-tech startup. I moved out to a beach close to Los Angeles with a business partner and hired 6 talented interns from top-tier schools. We lived, worked, and surfed together. (I tried to pitch this to MTV, didn't work!). We ended up building a startup, www.Inkba.com[1] .

I am a student here in the Netherlands. Since the start of September I have been doing an internship as well, and I would like some help with the train prices/cards.

I've been thinking of buying the 40% discount card and getting my two-way ticket every day with 40% discount. I just noticed though that for rush hours (which are the hours I travel) the discount is invalid. However I would like to save the money instead of paying the full train ticket - my internship place does not provide me with a train card, and I don't get much money from work, so by paying rent, utilities, trains and tuition fees I'm barely even at the end of the month. 

Are the conductors lenient, or do they actually even care if you have printed a discount ticket and have the discount card during rush hours, or will I be in trouble?

Thank you for your time and understanding! :)

PS I know I could try to apply for the StuFi and train card but since it is an internship and not a real job contract, I don't think I could get it.

The title is Network Engineer.....I kinda feel silly when people ask me what I do for a living and I sorta grin and mumble under my breath ""im a (pretend) network engineer.....""

Maybe its a combination of both who im working for and the people im working with but I cant really seem to make any headway, or it could be all me, which Im readily willing to accept.  Ive been here for almost a year and I still dont understand thing one about what exactly it is Im doing here. About the only thing I do know for sure is that I love the Data and Voice side of my job....the systems side i have no interest in whatsoever. We do have a senior tech that does everything I should be doing but he usually takes over any issues that are network related. Which in a sense I dont mind, but again, if hes capable then exactly what am I doing here?

I dont want to go up to my boss and tell him all this cause I fear it may not end well, after all he did hire me on the basis of my capabilities according to my resume. Which to be fair is honest about my knowledge of certain protocols and etc but what I left out is that I have never done any of those things in an enterprise environment. I cant and have no interest in hiding behind other techs who do actually know what they are doing, for fear of it hurting my career in the long run. 

The other part of my issue is confidence, ive always felt that I missed something by not getting an intern job after I graduated college and now im paying for it by struggling with my new job. I never got an intern job cause i switched into a computer career in my mid 30s and had a family to support so I couldnt afford to take a 10dollar an hour job. But then again... I know many of you IT professionals have never taken an intern job and flourished in your careers. So what gives with me?

So Reddit, heres my question.....
What do I do?....look for a different job or position that will allow me the freedom to expand my field experience? 
Or do I stick it out for as long as im willing and they will have me?

Any ideas or suggestions or anecdotes are much appreciated...

I live in the BB parking zone and had made plans with my roommate to go get parking permits from PPA on Friday morning (we both work during the day and couldn't go downtown before then). 


Yesterday morning, before I got a chance to run this errand, I got a parking ticket for being on my street without a permit. My question: **what are the odds that anything useful comes out of scheduling a hearing?** Is there a chance that, given that I just moved in this weekend, I'll see any sort of leniency or get the ticket rescinded? Or do they serve as a de facto revenue source, where I shouldn't waste my time trying? 

**update 9/10:** Went downtown after scheduling a hearing (responses here convinced me it wasn't a complete waste of time). The ticket was reduced from $45 to $25, with a stern lecture about responsibility. Given that I spent over an hour round trip including buses and waiting, I'm not sure it was worth the time; next time it happens in other circumstances, I'll probably just pay the damned ticket in full."

First and foremost I wish I remembered the person who helped me set some things in motion. That one sole redditor had set in motion a chain of events that has literally changed the course of my life.



The original thread was deleted likely because it contained personal information but I thought you'd want an update regardless. So after the initial shock I set about researching for an O-1 visa. 99% of people here thought I wouldn't qualify, and quite a few attorneys did also. But I finally got hold of a great company in LA who thought I would more than qualify, then proceeded to take my money and work with me for the next few months.



Applying for an O-1 visa is not an easy process, by any means. Couple that with me wanting to supply as much evidence as possible, I worked day and night to pull together as best a case as I could. Extra shoots, reaching out to fellow photographers and artists to write letters of support on my behalf and people inconsequently pulled through. They just did. Without rhyme nor reason they offered to help a friend in some cases and a stranger in others. To these people I owe more than I could ever write or say. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.



Some people wrote letters, some people gave me contacts, some people set up shoots for me, some people published my work.



I just got a call telling me that I've been granted O-1 status and am now able to stay in the country for 3 more years! In that time I'll be applying for a Green Card. 



Thank you Reddit. For being an opening ear and for allowing me to crowd source as much help as possible and in doing so, getting access to some great advice and allowing me to stay safe in my job and enjoy the next few years here in Chicago!



I haven't been in touch or heard from the girlfriend since, and I found an apartment to share with a great roommate with an astounding view of the city [picture here!](http://i.imgur.com/0L4FR.jpg)

zg02h,41,2012-09-06,I'm seriously frustrated.,grrarghlisten,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zg02h/im_seriously_frustrated/,"So I have always known that I do not want to go through pregnancy. I can't explain it, I've just always known. I have always wanted to adopt only. My mother was adopted, so at the very least I feel like I'd be honoring my grandmother. I have nightmares about being pregnant. I literally wake up screaming and clawing at my stomach. I can't look at pregnant people without getting nauseous. I refuse to watch movies/shows with pregnant people. It's disgusting to me.

When I was 16, I collapsed at work. I was a grocery bagger, and I lifted one of those 50lb dog bags and just collapsed in pain. My mom was luckily in that line and rushed me to the hospital. After a couple MRIs, I was diagnosed with severe PCOS. Seriously, my ovaries looked like raspberries. 

I was sent to follow up with a gynecologist in a few days. It was a male, and he forced me to do a transvaginal ultrasound. I was screaming in pain (I hadn't even masturbated, let alone had sex so it was super painful). He told me to shut the fuck up and that I was a weak bitch. Of course this just makes me start crying on top of being in pain. He told my mother I had a cyst burst and still had some fluid in my abdomen and it would pass. I was put on the patch, which made me absolutely crazy depressed and suicidal but my mother refused to take me to a different gynecologist and I was not going to go back to that one. The moment I got to college, I stopped taking the patch and just let my body try to regulate itself. 

Flash forward four years, and I met a wonderful guy. I finally felt comfortable with him to want to have sex, but I wanted to get on birth control because I absolutely do not want to be pregnant. I went to one of the two gynos my insurance covers in my tiny Texas town, and she told me she wouldn't give me birth control because I wasn't married and she refused to help a slut. Yeah, little me who was finally going to have sex with her first partner after about a year of dating.

So I went to the other gyno. She was slightly more understanding, but was hesitant. I had to bring in my boyfriend before she finally relented and said she would give me an IUD, but also said she would've felt more comfortable if I was married because then she wouldn't have to give me the IUD because I would need to make babies for Jesus. I kid you not, this is what she told us. But she at least was going to give me the IUD, so I just ignored her comments.

For the IUD, she gave me a pill that normally would kickstart labor as it widens the cervix opening. It was the weirdest feeling ever, and even typing this makes me shiver with dread. I hated it. I had contractions. It was just another nail in the already sealed coffin of no pregnancy for me. I got the IUD in, even though it was super painful.

Let's just say Mirena and I aren't friends. Two weeks after I got it in, I had a 5.5 month long period. Not just light spotting, but full on changing pads several times a day flow. I had two days off before another 2 month long period. And then, nothing. It was several months later when having sex that suddenly I felt a lot of pain, and noticed I was gushing blood. I was in terrible pain. I went to the doctor first thing in the morning and their conclusion was an ill timed period. Several months later, I got another horrible period. My gyno decided to put me on the pill on top of Mirena to try and regulate it, but all it did was give me 3 week long periods (and yes, the dummy pill weeks I didn't bleed) and depression. I stopped after 3 months, and just gave up. I still have the Mirena, but I still deal with 3-4 week long periods with about a week off. I should also mention that same boyfriend is now my husband, and we are both each other's only sexual partners.

I've always had this hope of California being this awesome place where I could finally get sterilized. My field of work meant at some point I would end up in California, and sure enough, here I am for a few short months on an internship. I saw a post in 2X a few months ago where I read you can't be turned away from sterilization in California for age/number of kids/etc. which was what was preventing me in Texas (my gyno said it was clinic policy to not do it until 30 or have 2 kids, and I simply can't drive to a big city easily enough to get it done there). So I made an appointment at Planned Parenthood, but they told me they didn't take my insurances (I have two) and it would be $250 for the consultation and $2700 for the procedure. There is just no way I can afford that, and I don't qualify for the grants because I'm not a state resident. So I got a list from my insurance and started calling. I made an appointment and went. My husband isn't with me, he's back in Texas. I was alone. And now, instead of being told they won't sterilize me because I should have babies for Jesus, I'm now told I have a mental illness and should see a therapist because I should want to be pregnant and have kids by now. I started sobbing while the doctor talked to me. I collected myself enough to leave and walk to few blocks to my car. Then I just lost it. All my hopes and dreams were crushed. A little old lady knocked on my car window and patted my head until I had calmed down enough to breathe and talk. She felt so sorry for me and I was thankful I had at least someone, even if it was a random stranger, to help me calm down. I went home and cried more to my husband on Skype.

I just can't help but think I would've gotten it had my husband been there with me. We both agree for 2-3 kids, and he doesn't care if they're adopted or biological and that it's my choice. He told me to make another appointment at a different doctor, but I don't know if I can handle that rejection again. A very close, trusted male friend who I know here has offered to pretend to be my husband and go with me to the doctor. But I simply don't know. I'm so upset.

Why can't I just control my uterus?!"

I will be living on the southern end of South Bank in student accommodation. I will be working weekdays during office hours but have plenty of free time!

The question is, what should I do this summer? Where should I visit (tourist attractions, food, culture, regions, suburbs)? Any awesome day trips for weekends (without use of a car)?

#I have read years and years of /r/Brisbane for similar posts and have taken note.

So far, im thinking of getting a hair cut at Esquire, eating pancakes, drinking xxxx in the sun and seeing cheap pictures at the cinemas in South Bank.

I like what i'm going to be doing as a career, but fuck me, it's really boring me at the moment, just all the theoretical stuff. Not to long ago i was questioning whether this really is for me, my unit co-ordinator told me that it's natural for a second year student to question what they are doing, and that second year is usually considered the worse/hardest due to the fact it's all just theoretical. He said 3rd and final year get alot more interesting, so i'm going to stick it out. Do any of you guys feel the same way? I was kind of scared at one point, I thought that i was just wasting my time, but i want to finish my degree, it's just what i'm doing at the moment is making me question whether i should do it...

I've also applied for numerous internships, i'm hoping getting some experience will bring get me more pumped to finish my degree."

[How do you think some of the most terrible movies actually make it to the big screen?  I would assume at some point SOMEONE read the scripts and thought, ""Wow, that's awful.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xoeb?context=5)|Funny you should say that...  we interviewed Jason Statham, and some thing came up about some movies of his that weren't well received, and he said that you don't think you're making a bad movie when you're in the middle of shooting.  Cut to three months later, I'm interviewing Rosario Dawson, and she's joking about some of her Tomatometer scores, and I tell her what Statham said about not thinking a movie is going to be bad, and she says ""Oh no, I knew that Pluto Nash would be bad""  But she said she couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with Eddie Murphy.
[Aha! Great to see you here, I'm a producer on a Documentary called Beijing Punk that's somehow been listed incorrectly on your site, the descriptive text and cast info on Rotten Tomatoes is from another film called Beijing Bubbles. I've tried raising trouble tickets and emailing to get it fixed but nothing's been done for months so I figured what the hell and thought I'd ask here :\)  Also we received a glowing review from the Huffington post but the Rotten Tomatoes page hasn't picked it up. How do we connect the two?  And to ask a general question to be on topic, how hard is it for independent filmmakers to get their film listed on your site? Do they have any control over the information presented or is it gleaned from sources automatically such as the IMDB? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c640ril?context=5)|Hey, hit me on Twitter @matchity, and I can help you out.
[Any chance of getting rid of this popup? Or maybe just stop showing it after we have seen it 100 times?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yqpy?context=5)|For what it's worth, I don't like that pop-up either.  
[Given how influential your site is, do you ever get pressure from studios to try and fudge the system to move an expensive stinker from rotten to fresh? If so, how do you respond?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xmo3?context=5)|We'll get a bunch of links to reviews from critics or sites that don't meet our qualifications.
 |We'll get asked to change a rotten review to a fresh one, because the review is neutral.
 |In the case of #1, we'll just say that the reviews don't qualify.  In the case of #2, we'll ask the critic if we've scored it right.  If they tell us to change it, we will, but we have to hear it from the critics.
[Going off the end of that, do you feel the critic's recommendation for each film is a good idea, rather than going strictly off the numbers? A 2.5/4 rating isn't necessarily ""rotten"" or ""fresh"", yet it goes either way. On top of that, I recently saw on early reviews of The Master, Richard Corliss' rating is a 7/10, and remains the only ""rotten"" rating (at this time\). Do you fee one way is better than the other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63y1hr?context=5)|2.5/4 may mean fresh to some reviewers and rotten to others.  Our hope is that people are actually clicking through to read reviews, rather than basing their *entire* decision about the score.
 |We've thought about the possibility of changing things up, but in all honesty, keeping the system mostly simple is probably going to be our best bet.  It allows for a level of transparency that we like, where as averaging out scores adds in a lot more subjectivity and reinterpretation than I think we're comfortable with.
[Why isn't Taken 100%?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xkhj?context=5)|Because we didn't get a threatening call from Liam Neeson yet.
[What rating have you disagreed with the most? What has been your biggest surprise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xigy?context=5)|I *hated* The Tree of Life, but most of the critics loved it, so maybe I was missing something.
 |And I was pleasantly surprised to see Fast Five get a fresh rating, but I love those movies anyway.  I was kinda surprised to see Expendables 2 end up as fresh.
[Speaking of Terrence Malick have you seen his new film To the Wonder and if so what do you think of it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yfsg?context=5)|Haven't seen it yet.
[Have you seen Crank 2: High Voltage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c641rec?context=5)|I love the Crank movies.  Totally trashy, totally awesome.

[I'm a long-time metacritic user.  How would you convince me that Rotten Tomatoes is better?  I prefer metacritic because they use numerical scores (which allows greater accuracy than a simple rotten or fresh\), among other reasons.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xsvd?context=5)|I think we have a broader pool, and a more democratic system, but I think Metacritic does a fine job doing what they do.
 |But if you like them better, then hey, that's like, your opinion man.
[Any thoughts on Metacritic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xp44?context=5)|I think they're good at what they do, but I think our site is more fun.  But obviously I'm biased.
 |I think a weighted average like theirs potentially opens the door to a lot of subjectivity on behalf of the aggregators, but we get similar criticism about how we handle neutral reviews.
 |Ultimately, we're both assigning numerical values to subjective analyses, so users have to pick which version of that they like more. 
[How does someone become a ""Top Critic""? Do you feel the ratings system is weighed fairly? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xngt?context=5)|The criteria for being a Top Critic are [here](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/help_desk/critics.php).  In a nutshell, we're looking for the people or sources that have the largest reach of the best writing.
 |We do try and make the system fair, in that it basically boils down to one critic - one vote.
[""Print publications must achieve and maintain status as one of the following: - A top 100 daily US newspaper - A top 100 weekly US newspaper""  What will you do when there are no more newspapers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c6402rr?context=5)|Not sure yet.  Honestly, that's something I really worry about.
[Tomato a fruit or a vegetable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xnrt?context=5)|Botanists say fruit, government says vegetable, I think.
[Whats your favorite guilty pleasure movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yw6q?context=5)|Probably The Fifth Element.  It's kind of a mess, but I love it.
[My question is how can you hope to control this, if at all on your website? Obviously when it got to death threats it was necessary not to allow commenting on the thread anymore, but there seems to be the amazing split with RT commenters where one person will trash the reviewer and the person directly below will say ""hey we're allowed our opinions"". Which side do you fall on, and how to you hope to gain traction with your users, if at all when it gets ugly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv46?context=5)|Ultimately, we're going to change how our comment threads are set up so that there isn't a thread for each review, and I think that will help a bit.  But we're a pretty big platform, and once you hit a certain traffic level, the trolls definitely come out.
[*The Godfather Part II* shows 2 rotten reviews, but when I try to read them, only one critic is shown.  What did you do to the other guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xw0y?context=5)|Ask Luca Brasi.
[How do you determine whether a critique is Rotten or Fresh if the general tone of the article seems to be neutral? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv7t?context=5)|In many cases, the critic submits the review with their own rating.  But when we pick up the review, sometimes everyone in the office will read it, and if we really can't agree on a rating, we'll ask the critic.  But if something's truly neutral, we'll usually mark it fresh; the phrase we use in the office in that case is ""tie goes to the runner""
[I'm sure you remember the ordeal with internet users flooding message boards of movie critics who gave *The Dark Knight Rises* a negative review, but there was one article in particular that I read who admitted that he hadn't seen the film yet. How can you add to/take away from a movie's tomato score based on someone who hasn't seen the film's opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv7t?context=5)|In that case, we took the link down to that review as soon as we saw it.
[How many miles do you recommend between tire rotations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv7t?context=5)|About 5,000 miles, depending on how you drive.
[Will the Rotten Tomatoes Show ever come back? And what's your personal opinion regarding the scores? Would you see any ""fresh"" movie as a movie one should go watch? I personally like the seperation into fresh and rotten because oftentimes it's just too much about critics ratings.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xw34?context=5)|That incarnation of the show if over, but we're trying to cook up some other things.  And I'm trying to get Brett and Ellen to come on the Rotten Tomatoes Radio show; I see Brett every week at Current, when I'm shooting What the Flick.
 |Regarding scores, I think they can be a good tool in the decision making process if you're on the fence about seeing a movie.  But if you're dying to see a particular movie, then go see it; it's ok to see (and like) a movie that the critics don't like.
 |Except Twilight.  Those movies are terrible.

[How does the Flixster/TWX ownership structure work?  Do you get Time Warner stock?  How much editorial freedom do you have, and are there any guarantees?  Theoretically you could get a call from your boss's boss's boss's boss telling you to find a way to give the latest Warner Bros. film a push over that line from rotten to fresh or else he'll fire you and find someone who will--right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c641ehv?context=5)|No stock, but total freedom to write and cover what we want.
 |If I'd had any doubts about that, they were erased the week Dark Knight Rises opened.  No one at WB gave me any direction on how to handle the commenter issues, or what to do when the incident in Aurora happened.  After that week, we got some feedback from corporate PR that they thought we handled everything well, but at no point did they ask us to do anything differently.
 |We never heard anything like that while we were part of News Corp, either.
[Texting in theaters - what should we do here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yw3p?context=5)|I could go on a huge rant here (I just did on last week's Rotten Tomatoes Radio show), but I'll just say that I don't think there's any justification for texting in theater full of people.  You're either too dumb to realize you're distracting others that paid to see the movie, or you just don't care.  Take your pick.

[I feel that the neutral comments really get me.  For example, one of the reviews will be bad and i read it, and sometimes I feel like its a good review and shouldn't be a rotten tomato.  Is there a system to determine if some of the neutral comments are rotten or not? It throws me off sometimes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xplc?context=5)|The neutral ones can be really hard to interpret sometimes.  Sometimes three or four of us will read the same review to try and find a line that really defines where the critic stands.  If we really can't figure it out, we'll ask the critic directly.  That comes up a lot with Hollywood Reporter and Variety, where some of the reviews are as much about the box office potential as they are about the quality.

[What was it like in the beginning of your business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xjbc?context=5)|Rotten Tomatoes began as a side project for a few employees at a company called Design Reactor in Emeryville, CA. This allowed them to fully develop and take risks with the RT concept. Once it became clear this was going to be huge, the site branched off onto its own.
[Was it hard, did people have doubts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xjbc?context=5)|You can see some of the stories about the early days of the site [here](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rumble_in_the_bronx/news/1736415/an_oral_history_of_rt_part_one_the_beginning/)

One of the coolest things about working at Rotten Tomatoes is that almost everyone in the film industry seems to know who we are and they use the site.  I interviewed James Remar a couple of weeks back and he joked about how many bad movies he had on our site.

But I think comparing critics scores to user scores is an apples/oranges comparison.  Users mostly choose movies they think they'll like, and they're usually right, so most users scores come from a self-selecting pool of people biased towards liking the film.  I'm painting in broad strokes here, but the I think the numbers are kind of a false comparison.

But I don't know that it's going to be a sudden tipping point, so much as it will be a slow erosion.  I think we're going to end up in a place where most movies are released ""day-and-date"" - all countries across all media (theaters, TV, internet) at the same time, and movie theaters will be a specialized event experience, like going to a ball game, instead of staying home and watching it on TV.

[One of the things that really stand out to me on the website is the user comments on the professional reviews. I think there is a very clear hivemind mentality among the user comments that is really disturbing - there are SO many hostile comments towards negative reviews for those ""good"" films and then so many patronizing comments towards positive reviews for ""bad"" films. How would you go about regulating these comments and improving discussion of these professional reviews? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63y4vr?context=5)|Yeah, we're planning to move away from having individual comment threads linked to specific reviews, because I think that helps focus the dogpile that happens when someone goes against the majority.  We'll have one thread for each movie that will be easier to police.
[Hi Matt! I'm an accredited film critic (not listed on RT yet, though\). I love your site, but there are limits in the RT system because of review nuance. Would you ever consider putting the option on RT where a user could see a page based on ratings (ie 3 stars our of 4\), not the fresh/rotten binary? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xrgm?context=5)|We've thought about doing something like that, but we suffer from a severe lack of development resources, and it's hard make the case for that level of expense (developer time=money) when other parts of the larger corporate organization have other priorities.
[P.S. - I was the longest intern the Rotten Tomatoes show had. I enjoyed my time thoroughly and look fondly back on the company as a whole.

But my take is that since Rotten Tomatoes is about critics' reviews, I feel like having professionals was closer to the spirit of the site. 
[I love you on the Adam Carolla podcast when you come on. Do you think anyone has the balls to tell him that movie was not that good? I love me some Ace, but that movie was not that good.

Fridays have more reviews, more press, and then eventually I go home.

zfrdd,3,2012-09-06,I have an idea - need criticism and advice,[deleted],Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/zfrdd/i_have_an_idea_need_criticism_and_advice/,"Hello /r/Entrepreneur,

I have an idea but I would appreciate your advice and criticism.

**Problem:**
A lot of interns from Universities/Colleges that find an internship position in a different city have difficulty renting out a place to stay. This is because the internship is so short (4-8 months) and landlords try to avoid short term tenants. Also, the hassle of travelling from city to city in order to meet the landlord, get approval, sign documents, etc makes the whole process very complicated.

**Solution:**
Provide a service where students approach me when they are looking for a place to rent , and where landlords approach me if they have vacancy and are willing to rent out for the short term. I would do all the searching based on the student's preferences, have all the documents prepared etc to make it hassle-free for the students (considering they would much rather focus on their upcoming exams). I would accept a small commission for helping the students find a placement. 

Tell me what  you guys think and if you have any advice on how I can make this work."
zfojp,15,2012-09-06,Am I going in the right direction with my code portfolio? Or does it make me look worse?,scoult3r,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zfojp/am_i_going_in_the_right_direction_with_my_code/,"I am a third year computer engineering student at a major university in Canada. I was unable to get into my schools coop program and so I am trying to find ways to make myself more appealing to companies whose internships I apply for directly.

I have a small but growing bundle of projects listed on my website at www.samcoulter.ca  and hosted on github @ www.github.com/scoult3r  which have two main purposes:

    1.Host the things I'm working on for fun
    2.Show those things off for potential employers.

However I'm worried the code im showcasing just isnt good enough.
The 2d Vector ""Library"" is laughably simple, although I am going to update that repo to a general tools Library of project agnostic home rolled code I use everyday.

My actual website is static HTML + CSS with no javascript and I'm pretty sure that my CSS classes are designed terribly. I plan on updating this to a dynamically served website with either flask or web.py or django or something. Its a low priority right now.

My centerpeice, the Collision Engine demo is also nowhere near acceptable. Right now it operates on extremely hacky collision detection and response. However I do plan on changing that, as the whole demo is probably only around 50% complete, and I am going to keep working on it through this semester (as hard on my schedule as that will be).

I know alot of ways in which my code needs to be improved, and I'm working towards that, problem is I need to be applying to jobs now, for next summer.

However, I'm currently of the belief that what I have is far far better than nothing. Is that correct?

Can anyone comment, and maybe provide some suggestions for immediate changes that would quickly push me in the right direction?

Also, what is the proper forum for saying ""This is my code, I know its shit, but im working on it."" Should that be in the comments or maybe a small breakdown on the repo README.

Thanks so much!

P.S. Resume suggestions? Im worried, that its also shit.

TL;DR: Just read it :p"
zfn96,7,2012-09-06,"I think I have an autistic intern. He struggles to do his job, and I need advice.",autismquestion,autism,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/zfn96/i_think_i_have_an_autistic_intern_he_struggles_to/,"To make a long story short, I work with animals and just got an intern for the next 4 months or so. We had interviewed him once and he came off as a little odd but we pegged it to him being nervous and my boss offered him the internship (He honestly wouldn't have been my first choice normally but we only had 2 students apply for this semester and the other declined).

I've now worked with him for about a week, and although he has never outwardly said it, I believe he is autistic. I'll be the first to admit I am not very familiar with autism so tell me if you think these actions would suggest autism. (Multiple coworkers have approached me with that diagnosis as well). 

He is very jumpy and nervous, constantly seeming uncomfortable. He is well read and seemingly intelligent but lacks common sense about relatively straight forward things like cutting fruit (He wound up with a large knife from behind his head and slammed it down an inch from his fingers to cut a banana). He takes things very literally, and seems to confuse social cues that a 'normal' person would not think twice about. Making small talk, I asked him today what he does for fun in his spare time and his first response was to sort of moan and say ""Ohh..ahh I dunno, my head kinda hurts today."" 

The job involves a lot of feeding and caring for animals, and after about a week he hasn't shown much improvement. He regularly forgets about certain animals he is required to care for. Today when I pointed out he missed a group of animals he needs to feed everyday (and has fed daily 3 or 4 times prior) his comment was to say that he didn't even know those animals existed.

My boss doesn't trust him alone, and rightfully so based on the knife incident and other incidents that ended in the death of small animals (for instance he killed an insect in a cage door he closed on it and made the comment that the animal wasn't smart enough to get out of the way, and he has thrown away some animals with their old food after being shown how to check it), so I've had to shadow him almost non stop. He is also very slow, taking as much as ten times longer than previous interns to do daily chores.  

The goal of the internship is to give them experience but also free up time for us to do other projects, and when I'm shadowing someone and they are taking much longer to do daily tasks than if I had done it myself it makes the entire process counter productive, and instead of freeing up time for me it has been a distraction that is taking away from my other tasks.

So I guess my questions for reddit is, 
A.) does this sound like autism or something else? In case it matters the guy is in his mid/late 20's when most interns we get are around 20.
B.) If he is autistic, how likely will it be that he improves to the point where he can take care of the animals in a safe way to himself and the animals without needing constant supervision?
C.) He seems very uncomfortable, but says he enjoys himself when asked. Are we putting him in an unfair situation or environment by expecting him to be self reliant?

zflxz,6,2012-09-06,[22/m]: I can't seem to maintain good relationships with my friends [20-22/m&amp;f]. Why?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zflxz/22m_i_cant_seem_to_maintain_good_relationships/,"Basically to summarize how I feel, I would say that my friends are a disappointment to me.  

More back story, I spent the first 16 years of my life as an army brat.  My family moved all over the country every three to four years.  As a consequence of that, I never got to develop any super close friendships and I was fine with that.  Things might have continued like that, but when my father retired, we began to live permanently in one place in the civilian world.  This happened at the beginning of high school.

Now that we would be living in one place, I thought it would be worth it to form some good friendships.  I had a good couple friends and one of them turned into a girlfriend, but that fell apart at the end of high school (due to us breaking up) leaving me with next to no friends.  I was extremely bitter about being abandoned; I had known these people for several years and they dropped me over night.

I thought college would bring the promise of genuine friends.  Everyone is more mature and ready for the next step in their lives.  I became friends with a group of people from my high school whom I knew from high school, but never talked to.  These people also turned out to be not so good friends.  I was screwed by my closest friend in the group over housing sophomore year; he apologized genuinely, but that friendship was never the same.  We're still ""friends"" but that relationship is on a steady decline and I see it ending once our undergraduate studies end.  The others in the group kinda fell away as well.  However, I had got into a group with some folks in my major and I thought that finally I had found a good group.  I was wrong yet again.

Junior year was great.  Lots of parties and social events.  Improvement in grades and attitude.  I was happier than I'd ever been.  I had a partner in crime; we worked with everyone else, but we frequently worked with each other.  That friend, a few others from that group, and I decided to sign on to an interdisciplinary design project which is a well known program at my university at the end of junior year.  Then the summer came and everyone went to internships in various places.  No one did anything for this project (we needed to be doing at least a little something) except for me.  I was supposedly working with my partner in crime on this project, but he did nothing as well. When I asked about how people were doing on the project, I was ignored or given vague meaningless responses.  First sign of trouble.

Senior year just started and I decided that I wanted to do that project to fulfill some degree requirements, but everyone else decided that they wanted to do other things to fill out these requirements which is fine, but they still want to be on the project which is not fine because now they're a liability.  I've been essentially left high and dry by friends again, but now on a difficult project that I am now committed to.  I have to work on the assumption that my friends will be useless because my grade is on the line and not theirs.

I think that I am a good friend and go out of my way to help them in their times of need.  Listening to their girl/boyfriend trouble, to their family problems, to their personal problems.  But no one ever seems to be around when I need them.  I always feel that it's a one way street.  My friends mean more to me than I must mean to them.  I'm not asking for the stars; I just want someone who I can rely on."

zfkuu,1,2012-09-05,My best friend's mother passed away last week.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zfkuu/my_best_friends_mother_passed_away_last_week/,"I wanted to post this here because... well, while I understand that it may not be the same for everybody, there's just something about losing your mother that I feel hits a girl, especially considering my friend is a mere 21 years old. I apologize for the wall of text in advance.

Her mother passed away after battling stage IV colon cancer for a long and torturous five years. She had previously had colon cancer that had gone into remission, and in between, she even had breast cancer. This woman was as tough as a woman and mother could be, her biggest concern was that her battle with cancer was causing pain and sadness all around her.

Very few people make it past five years of colon cancer, in fact, [only about 8% do](http://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/guide/treatment-stage?page=2).

Five years passed, she was deemed unoperable, and it was only a matter of time.

Now, I want to tell you a little about my friend. She is a strong, stubborn, passionate young woman whose life goal is to save the world through animal conservation. During these daunting and scary five years, she went to college in the next state over where I had the luck to meet her, went to Africa for a study abroad, and we started an extraordinarily successful animal conservation club at our university that took up a significant amount of time and weekends to accomplish. After she graduated, she moved across the country to study snakes for a summer internship. Once she was done, she moved in with her long term boyfriend that had found a position not far from her internship. Basically, she was a long ways from home.

She then had to decide when she had to go home. When she would spend the last moments with her mother. She thought at this point that her mother would still have at least a few months left, but the doctor told my friend that her mother's heart could fail at anytime. Not willing to take the risk however small, she went home as soon as she could. 

Her mother passed away two weeks later.

I could make this whole post about her mother and how strong she was, but that isn't what I want to talk about. My friend and I sat down a day after her mother's funeral and she confided to me that she always knew that this would be it, that the cancer was what was going to kill her mother. But, then she said something that really hit home.

**""I couldn't live like my mother was dying.""**

And that is entirely true. Her mother fought and battled a disease that could have taken her within the first year of having it, much less the full five years that it did take. Was my friend to stop living her life during some of her most pivotal and defining years in case her mother was to pass away the next day? I feel as though her mother was much happier watching her daughter progress and strive in life than she would have been had my friend been holding her hand every second of the day, with nothing new to add to the otherwise daunting conversation.

People often say to live like you were dying, but in another sense... live as though the people closest to you were dying. Because it's true, we are getting closer to dying everyday. Enjoy and take full advantage of the moments you have with them, be kind and respectful and a decent human being. And live your life, because that makes a better conversation.

Girls, always remember your mother, your best friend, or even your neighbor could die tomorrow. Don't stop living because of it."

So, here goes: It's been about two and a half years since we broke up. I loved him, thought he loved me, one day he told me he didn't love me any more, later found out he cheated. Awesome. Not the point. 

Two years later, I find myself in Florida for an internship. Keep in mind, I haven't spoken to the kid in about eight months. Out of no where, he texts me. I found the timing odd since my internship was going to end in two months and I would be returning home. During this time frame, we text every other day about just stuff. It felt like how we used to talk and it was nice. I return home, he invites me over to show me his new place, I accept the invitation. The first time I go over there, nothing happens, but he flirts and drops hints saying things like, I would give you gas money if you came and visited more often, I could help you study if you needed it, etc. Whatever. I go over there again to watch a movie we've been meaning to watch together for awhile. Let's just say things quickly escalated and bad decisions were made. I caved. 

Now, he hasn't said a word to me. My current plan of action is to not talk to him and wait until I run into him again (it's inevitable, we have a class together) to see how he acts. My question is this: Are we friends? Are we fucking? Are you pursuing me? Are we starting over?Did I just become a two-month-old booty call?What is the best way to ask him this? I just want all of this craziness to be over because a part of me still loves him, but I'm not about to be led on again and frankly, I'm goddamn sick of playing this game. I want an answer and I want to be done with it. 

TL;DR My ex and I hooked up after a month or so of talking and now I'm confused. What's the best way to approach this situation without coming off as clingy or creepy?

To explain more about the title, I don't know if I am looking in the right places or not, or if I'm just an idiot. I graduated almost a year ago with a BS in Electrical engineering, and have been actively searching for entry level positions and internships, but I haven't had any luck.

I think that my fault was not looking for internships/research opportunities during my undergraduate years (I actually never knew what an internship was until my last quarter of my undergrad). So basically I have had no experience other than from school projects; which I've included in my resume. 

I have had only one real interview, and five phone interviews, which I did call them back to follow up, but they end up saying I wasn't the right person (I assume I'm not good at interviews too, based on those). I was thinking of getting a recruiter/consultant soon, and go back to my college and ask for career resources once they begin school. So my question is, what am I doing wrong? What else should I be doing? "
zfaz6,3,2012-09-05,My dentist refereed me to an orthodontist and I'm scared to go to the appointment because the dentist said that I probably need surgery.   :(,kindabored,Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/zfaz6/my_dentist_refereed_me_to_an_orthodontist_and_im/,"I dont really know what I'm asking here - my dentist was grouchy and gruff and didn't tell me too much and now I'm scared about the future state of my  mouth...

So I told the dentist that I have been having pain in my jaw right in that area where it's connected to your head.  Also when I move my jaw around I feel like...well the only way I can describe it is that it feels like you know when you turn a screw too much and it overrides the threads?  Yah my jaw kind of makes a clicking no noise in my ear and feels like that.

Anyway my dentist said that it might be wearing down cartilage or something, (and of course it hurts and will presumably only get worse)! I also have a slight overbite which might also be part of the problem with the alignment of my jaw.  soo the options will be discussed with the orthodontia but it looks like my it's gonna be braces, or braces AND surgery where they freaking take apart my face and then put it together again and then wire my jaw shut or a few weeks while I suffer extreme pain.  

So my appointment isn't for another 3 weeks and now I have three weeks to worry.  is this really what's gonna happen?  Am I gonna have to have invasive surgery?   What about braces?  Can I get the kind that go behind your teeth instead of infront of them?  ALso how much is all this going to cost me?  I live in Canada so we have good health care here but dentistry still seem to be a little expensive.  Also I literally just graduated university - I took a part time job in my feild so that i could use the rest of the time to do a non-paid , part time internship which means that would affect how well I am covered for insurance.

zj2n9,0,2012-09-07,"I went at least a year and a half w/o PMO, and now have fallen back into old habits. I want to share how much of a difference it makes, and also get out of these habits once again. (long-post)",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/zj2n9/i_went_at_least_a_year_and_a_half_wo_pmo_and_now/,"First off, I found this subreddit today, and I'd like to say that this is awesome. It's so cool to see a community that's striving to eliminate the most sick, and most prominent things in today's society out of their lives. Like come on, that is awesome.

So I as I typed this out, I was trying to make it short, but I had too much I wanted to say, so it's a long post, my apologies. 

I was 16 when I started at stopping my PMO. And lasted from about April 2010 to about October 2011; so about a year and a half. It was awesome. I was free from all that crap and I just wanted nothing to do with it, it was an amazing feeling, especially at 16&amp;17, no one does that at that age (not trying to sound braggy). I was definitely very much involved in the church, I lived for God, and for others, and that's what kept me going. I had an amazing girlfriend and yeah, life was sweet. So come October 2011, I start kind of drifting away from the church (it was my senior year you know, can't let the church hold me down; yes I was a stupid teenager) and I relapse for the first time in over a year and a half, over 450 days of being free of PMO, gone. And from there it just got worse and now brings me to today.

I am glad I found people who actually want to rid themselves of this crap. Let me tell you though, it makes a HUGE difference in your lifestyle.

So as I say all this, keep in mind I'm not trying to talk myself up, or brag, but I'm just being real and speaking from experience. So as I was free of PMO, I was a really enjoyable person. I got along with everyone, I was very social, and people really seemed to like me as a person. Also communication with girls was easy for me, and who doesn't want that? Since I relapsed into it, I'm much more anti-social, I get more agitated, and most of all I feel A LOT more self-conscious and worry what others think of me way too much. I find it hard to talk to girls, and not be nervous around them. It sucks. I can't give you an explanation of why this happens, but it does. I am just not the same person I was, and I don't like that.

Also things were WAY different with the two relationships I was in. When I was with a girl and without PMO (we will call her girl#1) my relationship flourished. We had so much fun and were always happy it seemed. I always wanted to hang out with her, and visa versa, no matter what we were doing. We enjoyed each other's time a lot, without the physical side of it. But with the girl I was dating and self PMO was also involved things were nowhere near as good, (and we'll call her girl#2). With girl#2 I was not always wanting to hangout with her, I got annoyed with her easily, I looked at her in the wrong way too often (not that I looked at her as a sex object 24/7, I really did treat her well, but I was kind of corrupted in my thoughts) and it was just not as good as girl#1. Also in comparison, I was with girl#1 for around 9months, and girl#2 for less than 2 months. 

That being said, I ended things with girl#2 because I am doing an Internship at my church soon and want my full focus to be on that and growing with God, and learning more about myself. Even if I wasn't doing the internship though, I would have been with her for the wrong reasons, and it would have been not okay.

But to summarize everything, life is a lot better without PMO being involved. You have more confidence, you're relationships improve, you aren't comparing your significant other to what you see on the computer screen, and you feel so much better about life and yourself, you can't hide from experience, and that's what I'm speaking from. I know this is all kind of thrown together and not really well explained or written, but if you have any questions or want me to elaborate or offer advice, message me or leave a comment (I'll notice comments more so on my mobile app than messages).

And as I said before, I am not trying to brag of my 450+ days, or say ""Look at me, I'm great,"" trust me I'm no where near great or perfect, I just wanted to share encouragement. I'm stuck in the same place as most of us here, I'm on day one again today, but that brought me here. Support for each other is definitely the greatest thing we can provide here. You all are awesome."

ziqsq,1,2012-09-07,I'm afraid to improve my life because I'll have nothing to blame this feeling on.,deeperanddown,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ziqsq/im_afraid_to_improve_my_life_because_ill_have/,"I have been very fortunate in my life. I was born into a comfortable middle class family in one of the richest countries in the world, my parents never struggled for money and were never to strict on me.
I'm now 23 years old and am just about to complete a year long internship before returning to study for a year. I am 99% sure that I will be offered a permanent job once I complete my study with the company I've been working for for the last year. I've earned enough money this year to life independently of my parents, but I know that if I was stuck my parents would let me access money left to me by my grandparents, if that ran out I know my parents would support me in what ever I do. I also have good health (apart from a bit of weight issues which I'll come to in a bit) and a set of friends who are there for me if I need them.

All of this is great, however I have a paralysing fear ingrained into my brain. I feel incredibly lonely and it is only exacerbated by being in the company of others. I have never had a relationship and I blame it on being overweight although I know that's not the whole truth. I have zero self confidence when it comes to meeting strangers and a paralysing fear that I am doing something wrong in any situation.

In my mind if I hit the gym, cut down the calories and went out more I could find someone to share my time with easily. Despite being a virgin it's not just sex I want, I want someone to come home to; to cook and eat dinner with, to share the washing up and lean against while watching TV. If someone asks about what I did at the weekend I want to be able to say '*we* went to the park', '*we* went to the theatre' or '*we* just stayed home and did nothing' rather than '*I* just sat and moped' or '*I* went to the cinema by myself again'.

My fear is that if I find this magic person who puts up with me and smiles when she sees me come home everyday, I'll still be depressed. Now I have this thing which I know is missing, I can blame that for my misery and depression and know that it could happen one day and I should look forward to it, that's what keeps me going.

I'm terrified that in 20 years time I'm living in a nice house, with a brilliant partner and awesome kids I'll still feel like this. I'll have nothing to blame for the depression and have to acknowledge that I just have a brain that makes me feel miserable and worthless and leaves me spending an entire day curled up crying in bed when I know that friends have invited me to go do something fun.

I haven't been diagnosed with any form of clinical depression. I'm too scared of going to a doctor and being told that there is nothing wrong and I should cheer up. My doctors surgery is in a small town and all the staff know all my family. I know about doctor patient confidentiality but I just can't get this though out of my head. I have and will happily go and see a doctor about my swollen balls or anything physically embarrassing, but the though of someone going 'Did you hear about deeperanddown? He thinks he's got depression!'

Does anyone else have this kind of attitude?


P.S. I hope this makes sense as typing it has been a struggle and I just can't face proof reading it."

Do you ever get a semi chubby?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64jbfj?context=5)|I'm happy that I didn't post it but that gif is the closest SFW image that I can stand by. That is basically what we do with bounce testing but the floor is more of a spring board, and we test 3 at a time. Any more and its just a room full of girls bouncing around in bras. Not a bad thing, just too much data to be collected at once! But yes, I do have whole days that consist of that sort of thing.
[Please for the love of god tell me your average day goes a little something like this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64jbfj?context=5)|And a straight male doing my work, HOW could I never react? I just keep it under wraps.
[Well, now that we've established that you have the best job in the world...  How much do you make, if you don't mind me asking? You don't have to be exact... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64jke0?context=5)|I don't mind due to the certain amount of anonimity that I somehow am about to maintain here ~80k it fluctuates depending on if/when patents go through.
[How can I sign up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64r02r?context=5)|Lol! Umm.... Apply?
[So do I just google boob tester? What's your job title? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64uvbf?context=5)|Lol that would be funny to see the results from that. And my official job title is quality engineer.
[I'm a 30G. My bras are insanely expensive. I'd like to be a VS customer, but I can't buy anything you sell (bra-wise, anyway. I love my VS bathrobe\). I know there's limited demand for some sizes, but why not sell some of the less-popular cup sizes with a range of adjustable bands? Would there be an engineering problem with making adjustable bands? Are the different sizes constructed differently, or are larger sizes just scaled-up versions of the smaller sizes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64ooki?context=5)|This is a very good question. The problem becomes more intense when the fact that Boobs don't scale up in proportion with height or width with body size. I know right? I was just as baffled when I learned this, having been a self appointed. Ion expert before this job. But long story short. In order to make a bra comfortable AND adjustable there would be so many places to adjust it that most girls I assume would go commando (is that what girls call it with bras too) instead of fool with it at all.
[Do you ever use a wind tunnel? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64iiy9?context=5)|Long story short, we have in the past. It is extremely more cost effective to just use a fan to implement most normal wind conditions. However, the factor of safety after bounce testing is well enough to withstand a gust of wind.
[Did you go to college? And if so, did you get an engineering degree?  What is something that we don't know about bras but should?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64iq7u?context=5)|Yes - Yes - and that when in a bind for a sling, a bra is better to use that a shirt. It yields more immediate support with essentially no strain. Other than that bras are pretty straight forward. Oh, and for the ladies - If you pop out when you are bending over or jumping, you are wearing the wrong size. Most people will probably think I'm stating the obvious but I've ran into testers that promised me that they knew their size and it was the bras fault. Then, when we sized them appropriately most of the time they were a whole cup size off.

[I really don't believe this guy one bit ....  I've worked for Limited Brands as an intern and had frequent conversation with the Sr. Engineer of Innovation and Tech Services at VS.  *depending on if/when patents go through.*  Limited Brands/VS does not file patents with bra technologies.Les Wexner believes, by the time the competition figures it out, it is too late, and the fact that when you think of bra and lingerie, you always think of VS.   *Do you ever use a wind tunnel? Actually no,  the testing that are done with the bra is .... gas chamber - to test the reaction of the fabric with certain gases Laundry Machines - Test several different type of pH levels of water, reaction to detergents, and drying methods  Stretcher - Idk the real name for this machine but its primary use is to stretch the bra as far as possible and somehow measures usage over time.  Machine that literally spins the bra and shreds it, also it measures how long the shine lasts on the bra over time.*  What is interesting is, they have a lab with different types of lighting and a book of the different types of fabric. What they do is study how bras look under different lighting \) at the stores.   *Why doesn't your company create VS male underwear.*  I know this is a joke, but LB main focus is womens apparel. In the past LB has owned Abercrombie and Express but due to poor performance they were let go. LB recently started re-focusing on women's apparel and fragrances.  *Prove to us that you work with boobs all day. Prove us what's on the menu today!*  Actually people who work for VS do not work with boobs all day. Most of these people who are involved are from a textile background. The mentor I was with worked on Kevlar and now is the leading tech for Bra Technology.   *I'm a 30G. My bras are insanely expensive. I'd like to be a VS customer, but I can't buy anything you sell (bra-wise, anyway. I love my VS bathrobe\).*  You need to call Victoria Secret Direct, they have a wide variety and items not sold in stores. They are pretty good with shipping and you can always catch deals online. Always direct call.   *Did you go to college? And if so, did you get an engineering degree?*  Most of the people I met in Bra Tech had some sort of materials study or actually went to school for textiles.   *What is something that we don't know about bras but should? VS bras are not about comfort. The mentor I met explained this to me... VS can make the most comfortable bra in the world but thats not why people buy VS bras. People buy VS bras cause of the appeal of sex. What the tech has to gauge is comfort level, and how far they can go with style and sacrifice comfort. He explained to me that comfort is only a tolerance of pain.*  The one bra that intrigued me was the VS Incredible Bra. First of the the elasticity of the bra is amazing. It is able to attain its elasticity even after being stretched 2-3x its initial length. On top of that it has a high comfort level and does not have side fat build up (I really dont know what the real term is\). Another interesting thing about bra technology that is so hard to control are white bras. Many ladies get frustrated because the white bras will not stay white. First the edges will lose color (light brown/tan\) then the bra loses its shine. This occurs because of exposure to different gases in the environment, and simply the fact that over time materials will decompose towards its natural color/state.   *I've ran into testers that promised me that they knew their size and it was the bras fault. Then, when we sized them appropriately most of the time they were a whole cup size off.*  Seriously? VS bras even the same sizes fit differently, this is why they have a fitting procedure when you go to the stores. If you ever looked at the card it states the size, model, and color. A size from one brand or within the same brand isnt the same all across the board.   *How do I start a company for this?*  Www.limitedbrands.com apply there.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64pvsu?context=5)|Sir I got a few lines into this comment and realized that you are either trying to hijack my thread for your own position or count an interns work as an equivalent engineers work at a company that sells essentially higher quality products.

I think most people get confused because many times its a clasp of many hooks. If you treat it like a single hook and then with one or more hands pull the two sides in and stick a finger between the material and the skin and give it a nice trust out (finger only not the hands that you're pulling the bra together with or else you snap it into her back when you let go) the forces holding it together will act as a jerk resistance to the hooks at it will release.

ziq7z,164,2012-09-07,Coincidences,MutantExtractor,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ziq7z/coincidences/,"[Evan](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zepur/evan/)

Being closer to my family brought on a lot more then I thought in regards to the box and the contents. My brother, even after hearing the tapes and wanting to never hear them again, sat me down and told me he wanted to talk about everything I was finding. 

He's never been someone to fear things, often in our childhood he would tease me over being cautious. You see, I have to be cautious because of how I am. I'm not dyslexic, but I do have trouble with balance and reading. At times it proves to take it's toll on me when I do my studies and my internship.

He sat with me and stared at the box. To be honest, he didn't really stare at it as much as he was *glaring* at it. I found it amusing and told him to be nice to the box, I said, ""If you glare at it you might hurt it's feelings."" 

He didn't find it very amusing. 

""That box is going to get you in trouble, Austin."" Yes, finally a name, my name is Austin. We'll leave out last names. 

I shrugged it off. 

I showed him the files on Evan and instead of looking at what I was showing him, he was looking at me. He was watching me carefully, almost as if he was trying to figure out a riddle. As kids, our parents gave us riddles to figure out to keep us busy.

While I was very eager to solve each riddle, and I was also very good at most of them, not all; my brother wasn't. He was always annoyed with the riddles and would have me give him the answers.

I told him simply, ""It's just to keep me busy."" 

It's the truth, this keeps my mind busy. Too much time and I often get very uneasy. I need to keep busy.

""No one wanted the case, that should be a hint.""

He took the papers and slammed them into the box. My mother came in and just crossed her arms over her chest. She told him to fix the papers and to apologize, but all he did was walk pass her.

I told her it was fine. He could be nervous for me, and he had his own worries on top of this, so he must have had a bad day. A bad week. Something bad.

My mother said something very odd to me, which is why I am putting this here for you all. 

""He must be nervous ever since last month.""

Last month? Well, what happened last month?

I asked her this.

""Your grandparents adopted me."" She said, and I laughed a bit. 

Just a coincidence, right? She was adopted. I don't love my grandparents any less. I don't love her any less. Just because a case had a foster family in it doesn't mean anything.

""They were foster kids, not adopted."" I said, and I took the box to put it into my car. My mom just smiled and sighed, hugging me before I was fully set to head back home with all of my things.

""They adopted me a little after they got me. I suppose they really enjoyed having me."" She waved at me and I watched her go into the house. 

The house we grew up in. From the apartment to this house, my mind was a bit confused. My parents stayed as long as they could with me in the apartment until they finally went to the house once more. Apartments aren't for them, they love having their own space without people above or below them.

I live in the apartment alone and pay some of the rent to help them, they own the house so they help me with the rent so I could get through school and my internship.

But the house, it was odd to me suddenly. Not familiar like you would expect from a house you grew up in.

I didn't stay long, just drove down the same road back to my place and unpacked everything. (When I say unpack, I mean I shoved the clothes from the bag to a hamper, clean or not, and then sat on my couch. I'm guilty of being a bit of a lazy person when I'm tired.)

With my eyes shut I remembered something and came here to type. I'm going to keep putting the things I find up here, but also some new things. Because I remember something from my childhood, I remember a riddle that was like a scavenger hunt. 

One of the hunts led us around our house and then over to some doors that were in the ground. It wasn't extremely close to the house, but not very far either. My father came to us during that hunt and said it was time to head back inside. 

I asked what it was, thinking it was some doorway to a magic world. I had a very wild imagination. He said it was a shelter, and that he never thought to really open it up at all. It was just there, and now, so many years later, I'm wondering if I can go to that shelter.

Coincidence is something common. An adopted mother and a shelter by our house. I texted my brother about it.

**Remember the shelter we found? Let's go there this Sunday together. You and me.**

**No.**

**I'm going anyway, I'll take pictures.**

**Don't go, now you're just being stupid.**

As you can imagine, this went on with us bickering like brothers do with one another over it. But now, he's agreed to go with me. We go, we look, we leave. No snooping, no lingering, no 'hunting', just looking. 

I'll post another content from the box tonight.

ziox5,38,2012-09-07,"Educated felon unsuccessfully trying to get a job. Reddit, how many people know this struggle?",ThrowAway_Felon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ziox5/educated_felon_unsuccessfully_trying_to_get_a_job/,"Without going into too much detail initially, I am a felon who is thusfar unsuccessfully seeking gainful employment. I have a college degree from a prestigious university and years of real world marketing experience. Yet the only jobs I can get are very low-wage/low mental capacity type of positions.

My felony is literally the result of politics and a set of odd circumstances and decisions that hidsight now condemns, but none-the-less it is a hinderance in gaining a meaningful position anywhere. In college I was able to work internships for free without much of an issue, and after college I spent time working for friends and eventually myself in the field of marketing. In addition I've also volunteered for a variety of organizations since I was young and continue to do so in present day.

My company makes a little bit of money, but doens't have the funding to get real traction and loans are all but out of the question. This leaves me earning less than I can really afford to live on.

Today I was flat out told ""I'm very sorry, but we can't hire you"" by a lady in an interview who by all other standards seemed genuinely interested in hiring me. The position wasn't even great - it paid $11/hr. Apparently their national office had an issue with hiring anyone with a criminal background.

My question then, is do other redditors have this issue? How have you overcome it? What steps can I take? My resume is well-written and fairly impressive, I have great recommendations and anecdotal evidence of my abilities. How do I get a chance somewhere?"

[In your honest professional oppinion, should marijuana be legalized? Should it be on par with alcohol?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64jizo?context=5)|Yes. It is safer, both in the short and long term, than either alcohol or tobacco, with little-to-no long term functional impairment.

[If you had a teenage son or daughter would you be okay with them smoking weed? (and why or why not..\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64ijwc?context=5)|Not until they were 18.
[Caffeine, mango, chocolate, tobacco, banana, have all been anecdotally known to 'prolong' the effects of marijuana. Is this true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64jlge?context=5)|Yes, each for a different reason. Mango, for example, is high in myrcene, a terpene found also in cannabis. Myrcene has been found anecdotally to prolonog the high of cannabis. The current theory holds that terpenes affect the binding of THC to the different CB receptors found throughout the body, thus changing the high as well as the physiological effects. Terpenes have also been found to enhance the crossing of cannabinoids and other drugs through various tissue barriers, thus increasing absorption. Here is an article on various terpenes in cannabis :[Cannabis and Cannabis Extracts; DOI:10.1300/J175v01n03_08 ; John M. McPartland &amp; Ethan B. Russo pages 103-132] 
[What do you see for the future of science regarding cannabis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64jwb4?context=5)|I see FDA rescheduling to Schedule II or III sometime in the future because they can't ignore science forever. This will mean very tight regulations everywhere, even california.
[What do you enjoy the most about your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64jwb4?context=5)|I like science that is used ultimately to heal, not prolong illness. Also, this is a frontier area that hasn't been explored much until very recently.
[What are the studied side-effects of smoking? Long-term?  Is it true that one can be at risk during developmental years, and become unaffected of the side-effects after teenage years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64ir76?context=5)|Smoking cannabis is risky for those whose brains have not fully developed. There is an increased risk of later psychosis[see: Cannabis use in adolescence and risk for adult psychosis: longitudinal prospective study (BMJ 2002; 325 doi: 10.1136/bmj.325.7374.1212 (Published 23 November 2002))]  There was also a recent study that found adolescent smokers were an average of 8 IQ points below those who did not smoke when tested later in life. However, studies have failed to show long term deficits in those who started after age 18, when the brain is fully developed.
[What would you say the biggest misconception there is out there regarding potency of marijuana or just marijuana in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64k9j3?context=5)|The biggest misconception is that it is in some way poisonous to people or that you can get some kind of brain damage from a potency that is too high. It is completely safe at any dose ... unless you inject concentrated THC directly into your brain.
[THC is the active ingredient in marijuana that causes a high. What causes different strains IE Indica vs Sativa to produce different sensations and types of high. Also how does the method of use, ingested vs smoked change the feeling of the high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64ijlg?context=5)|Different strains have different levels of THC but also CBD, CBN, THCV, and other cannabinoids. Some of these cannabinoids have psychotropic (""high"") effects, and some don't. Some enhance the effects of THC and some mitigate it. The terpenes and terpenoids found in cannabis have been shown to have similar effects, though they haven't been studied to the same extent. Each strain group has it's own ""profile"", it's own combination of cannabinoids and terpenoids that produce a unique type of high.
[How often do you receive MJ that has adulterants?  What are they typically?  Do you get many with mold?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64ja68?context=5)|We haven't seen many with the specific pesticides that we test for, but we are constantly improving our sensitivity and cross-checking with other labs. We do get many samples that have mold. Most commonly it is penicilium which is harmless. Occasionally we get aspergillus which can be toxic, but most often to those with compromised immune systems (patients with AIDS, cancer, advanced age)
[Just posted this to /r/trees :\) Thanks for doing this!  What do you feel is the biggest risk for daily users?  What are some resources that can help educate the public on the subject?  Are there any intern type opportunities in your lab? I'm studying bioengineering currently in the Bay Area!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64jbci?context=5)|The biggest risks are those that come with smoking anything. Burning plant material produces ammonia, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (carcinogenic), and air that is at a temperature too high for lung tissue to deal with, among other things. Unfortunately, there aren't too many resources on the subject that the general public would benefit from. That's why I'm starting this. 
[Awesome - exactly what I thought! Vaporization rather than combustion takes care of many of these problems though, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64jyen?context=5)|Absolutely right.
[Most marijuana usage is focused around the brian, as a cardiovascular researcher I lean more towards the heart. What is your position on the evidence, albeit small, on cannabis causing cardiac dysrythmias? From my understanding it can cause atrial flutters and premature ventricle contractions. While these are easily enough reversed when the drugs effects where off, what do you feel would happen to a regular or heavy user? Would there be any cardiac remodeling from consistent pressure and would you recommend that anyone prone to some cardiovascular diseases not use cannabis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64kn9v?context=5)|From what I've read, cannabis can cause dysrythmias and even coronary ischaemia but it always seems to happen in patients with existing cardiovascular disease of some kind. So yes, I would caution those with known conditions to be careful, consult a real doctor, and start at a very low dose. But I don't see long term cannabis use actually causing a blockage or other condition, based on current evidence. No long-term studies have dealt with cardiac remodeling but if anybody out there happens to run clinical laboratory it is definitely something to look into. 
[Are the carcinogens in weed any better than those in tobacco?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64kcld?context=5)|Weed has less carcinogens than tobacco when smoked, in particular polyaromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, cannabinoids prevents tumor formation/proliferation, which is why no study has been able to link lung cancer to long term smoking of cannabis.
[Does smoking a lot of weed cause bad breath?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64j4x4?context=5)|Smoking anything can cause bad breath as it interferes with the natural bacteria which live on the tongue.
[So is that bad? Would consuming these things (mango, chocolate, coffee\) make marijuana more unhealthy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64juz0?context=5)|Not at all. Unless you are prone to high blood pressure, heart rate, or stroke in which case the xanthenes + cannabis can cause some unpleasant synergystic effects.
[Did you smoke weed before your top tier education and 6 years of research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64iodm?context=5)|I didn't try cannabis until I was 18 and accepted to college. I didn't smoke regularly until I was 21 and needed to mitigate some of the engineering-induced anxiety that was keeping me from getting my work done.
[Marijuana as a medicine for migraines? Your take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64k26v?context=5)|It works for some. I find that people that are prone to motion sickness tend to get the same symptoms from cannabis. BUT strains that have a high content of limonene (lemon-orange smell) tend to aid in reducing migranes (as does smelling pure limonene which is found in orange oil)
[That's ridiculously cool, and I'm interested in learning more. You should answer questions often. Any way to contact you to have questions answered in the long term? Maybe start a twitter or something.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64xq4x?context=5)|Facebook.com/whatareyousmoking.

(No specific location\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64k6an?context=5)|No. Unfortunately all Cannabis is illegal in the US, including the non-psychoactive hemp varieties. They are great plants though, and provide natural pest-deterrents and soil remediation.
[Is this technically a Quality Control job? Like, do you get inspected by the FDA and do you have to follow GMP/GDP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64k46l?context=5)|We are currently working on ISO 17025 compliance.
[How does one go about testing thc potency I  am majoring in structural engineering and trying to get into minoring in a chemistry degree, would that minor degree help me to achieve knowledge and practice for testing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64iu1y?context=5)|Yes, but mostly you just need experience in chromatography. That is what we use to determine potency. We do liquid and gas chromatography with mass spec, and also created an NIR equivalent.
[For this, do you use a dual-column gas chromatograph, Hewlett-Packard model 5710a with flame analyzing detectors? Also, does the floor model come turbo-charged?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64mnt7?context=5)|I use an agilent 7890 gas chromatograph with FID and MSD (separate colums for pesticides and potency)
[Are you the guy who posted about the hallucinogen that's only found in mass produced pot?  (Ie, closet grows don't have any.\)  Do you know anything about this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64k0on?context=5)|No but if you find something please post it here I'd love to look into it.
[Is there a Scoville scale-equivalent for potency levels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64iwj1?context=5)|Currently we report the concentration of cannabinoids (THC, CBD, CBN, etc.) by weight as potency. No Scoville-esque scale exists for cannabis.... yet....
[Many believe that mangoes contain enough Myrcene to make a noticeable difference in the high. Is there any truth to this, or is it merely a placebo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh2wq/iama_chemist_at_a_cannabis_analysis_laboratory_in/c64iw57?context=5)|See above post.

ziky5,2,2012-09-07,Multiple Internships or One Job? ,techonomics,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ziky5/multiple_internships_or_one_job/,"I'm currently a Computer Science student right now and the I've been working (basically as a junior programmer/(and occasionally IT support) at small company(200 total employees) for the past year. I like the company, I like the people, etc. I get paid the standard internship rate per hour and yeah, I'm pretty happy with it. 

As I'm taking more Comp Sci classes, I'm noticing some people are completing multiple short internships with big(ger) name companies (bigger than the company I work for). So, this is my question: 

To Potential Employers, would multiple internships(say, 4-6 months each) at mid to large size companies look more attractive than one job (focused on programming in JavasScript, Python, and some c#) that I stayed at for 5 years? 

**TLDR: What looks more attractive on a resume: multiple short internships or one position held for 5 years?** 

Note: I'm also fairly positive that I have room to grow(position-wise) at my current company. "

[How effective has LinkedIn been in finding great candidates? 90% of my interview calls were based on my use of LinkedIn for networking with the right people.  In this economy is there a preference for hiring US citizens with less experience and skill (and provide them training\) instead of a highly qualified immigrant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e648?context=5)|Yes, I work for a company in the addiction treatment field.  A lot of our employees have a past and we work with them case by case.  Bigger companies might be more hard and fast in their selection process and disqualify workers because of a record.  Although google Seymour Schlager and see how some companies are clueless, I have a great story about this guy, personal experience.
[What personality traits do you look for in a candidate based on your experience with big companies? Working in a startup, apart from talent and skill, we look for people who fit the company culture versus 9-5ers.  Any experiences hiring candidates with criminal records? Are they vetted out in the application filters itself? From your experience what's the general policy among big corporations on hiring someone with a record?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e648?context=5)|I have primarily a small company background(inside) and a bigger company background working from the outside.  I always look for someone that can demonstrate ""flexibility"" to me especially if they are going from big company to a more entrepreneurial start-up environment.
[I posted this in the other AM, might as well try here!  At the company I work at, I went from being a Unit Manager to a Reporting Analyst, essentially two levels below.  Will this ""demotion"" of sorts have a negative impact when other companies look at my resume? How can I make it positive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64ebzj?context=5)|Was the demotion due to a company wide reduction in force or something similar?
[Not an official demotion, but the team was restructuring. So my role doesn't exist anymore. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64efpr?context=5)|It has been restructure mania for years so recruiters and HR get it.  Spin it by explaining that your position was eliminated but they valued you as an employee and wanted to keep you.  You loved the company and wanted to stay.  Coo, thing is they definitely took a risk by putting you in a position you were overqualified for knowing you would probably be looking.  Good HR people will get that.
[What is the largest salary you ever offered someone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64dx3q?context=5)|Base was over 500K, package with stock options and everything took it over a million.  Deal took over 9 months to put together and fell through at the last minute because of an amended non-compete the candidate had forgotten about, never got over that one.
[What is your cut on something like that, if it had gone threw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e177?context=5)|In the firm I was working at it depended on how many people were assigned to the search.  On that one the total fee was probably just north of $150,000.00  I would have seen at least 30K.
[I work for an ex big firm partner who's gone on his/her own now - you should really do that if you have the contacts...pure profit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64fdmo?context=5)|I work on my own now, its all mine.
[Can you give a reference on the BEST way to format a resume? I can read five different sites and get five different answers..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64dy1n?context=5)|Love this question and you are right, you can get a million different answers.  For me the most important thing is that I shouldn't have to ""work"" to figure out who you are and what you do.  For those just graduating you should list your education first and then your employment history.  I think a chronological resume is best, use highlighting carefully, try an include a concise objective to tell the employer what type of position you seek.  Include a ""skills"" section listing your technical capabilities.  And whatever format you use check it 50 times for any grammar or spelling problems.  Hope that helps and feel fee to DM me for my email, be happy to review your resume.
[From your experience, what would you say is the percent of applicants found through online job postings versus applicants that ""knew"" someone in the company already and applied that way?  In other words, is filling out online job applications really just a huge waste of time that would be better spent trying to network?  Or does the private sector really actually hire people through online applications?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64eeb7?context=5)|Companies absolutely hire through job postings although they aren't my favorite way to find someone unless I am under a tight deadline or I need multiple people.  Always network as much as you can, best method by far for finding a new job.  
[Thank you for doing this. I have a few questions I've never really had the chance to ask someone who may actually have answers.  I graduated about a year ago from a very well-regarded university. Unfortunately, while I was in school my personal life severely imploded (repeatedly\) and my grades really suffered. Staying in school was difficult enough and I did not partake in any internships/jobs and hence have zero work experience in my field. I took the last year off to deal with all the aftermath and get my feet back on the ground. I feel like I'm finally ready to start working again. But I'm wondering how I can convey to a potential employer that I'm a good candidate despite the fact that I have these giant red flags? The last thing I want to do is throw a pity party on my cover letter/interview. I'm sure they don't want to hear my sob story. And how do I explain such a large gap in my history in a way that won't make it look like a potential liability in the future? I know I'm quite competent, but how do I convince them that I'm worth taking a chance on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64elnx?context=5)|Thanks for this and the biggest thing right now is that you must be sure in your heart and mind that you are ready to take on a job. Have you gotten the help that you need and is your personal life settled?  The worst thing that can happen is that you land a new gig and another nuke goes off and you implode again, make sense?  If you are ready you need to be as honest as you can be without going into too much detail.  Interviewers don't like to feel uncomfortable so don't take the there.  Try and paint your ability to overcome some personal obstacles and actually finish school as a positive achievement, which it is.  You have to really exude confidence if you get an interview and keep you expectations reasonable for a first job.  Also, get some good references lined up that can speak to your character.  I hope this helps a little, good luck.
[1\) Is an executive recruiter functionally a headhunter? I keep thinking of Mila Kunis in Friends with Benefits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e7fm?context=5)|Yes, I am a headhunter and who is this Mila Kunis?  Kidding of course.
[2\) What does the fee look like? Is it 20% of a person's gross salary? Does the jobhunter pay you a fee?  3\) What fields do you work with? I'm asking because i'll be a PhD (no time soon though\) who might look to go into industry in a marketing or management capacity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e7fm?context=5)|Fee can be anywhere between 10% if you are a shitty recruiter mucking up the profession to over 30% in a retained situation.  I am typically at 20 - 25% of a persons first year gross and guaranteed bonus.  Jobhunter pays no fee. 3) primarily healthcare, place many graduates from doctoral programs but primarily thise with at least 5-10 years of industry experience, pharma and biotech mostly.
[20% seems phenomenally high. You only need to make 5 placements a year working for yourself to hit median income? How many placements do you actually make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64omsn?context=5)|Working part-time I have place four people this year in positions ranging from 95 to 160K.  I hope to do 2 more by the end of the year.  Of course I have had at least 7 or 8 deals go south which I worked very hard on so yes when things work the fees are good, but it evens out I think.
[So minimum 114-192k before expenses part-time? That's ridiculous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c650pfd?context=5)|I guess you could see it that way.  Expenses can be high, taxes are a killer.
[How much knowledge do you generally have in the field a candidate maye be applying for? For example if someone applies to be in IT or your software engineeeing department, would.you be well versed in that field or the requirements of the job, or is that something you leave to the technical team?  If it's a field.you don't necessarily know the details of,  what do you look for in a candidate when eeading their resume or interviewing them? Thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e5oo?context=5)|Great question and on the executive recruitment side that is why I specialize in healthcare. I have learned the field and can talk somewhat intelligently about most positions.  Now in HR where I am asked to review resumes from all walks of life I am a bit hamstring by my lack of technical and subject matter knowledge for some positions.  I do however take the time to meet my hiring managers and learn as much about what they do and need as possible.  That being said I always get a list of must have from the hiring manager, if I don't see them on the resume I probably won't call the person.  If I see the must have then I look for stability and career progression.  If that makes sense then I call and do a quick screen.
[Can you explain what a recruiter does and who you (generally\) work for? Do you recruit within a certain field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64eclm?context=5)|Love the name, healthcare mostly.  Employers come to me when they are having a tough time finding the right person for a particular role.  My job is to learn about their company and basically sell it to a candidate.  I am lucky that I have been successful and can choose the companies I want to represent, my motto is cool jobs for cool people.
[If I was applying for a new job while currently having one, should I mention that I have a job already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64ei0g?context=5)|Yes, and make sure you tell them they cannot contact your current employer. 
[What if they ask for reference and says that they'll need to contact the references?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64o4hf?context=5)|Say you are currently employed and you can't jeopardize that status and give them refs from previous employers.  If a potential employer pushes and want refs from you current job then they are clueless and you don't want to work there, make sense?
[May I ask why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64hu69?context=5)|Well I guess I should qualify that statement.  If your current employer knows that you are looking for a new job and they are ok with that, then by all means allow a prospective employer to contact your current one.
[If you tell a potential employer that you would rather they not contact your current employer, are they likely to ask why you're leaving in order to get a feel for the way you'd speak about your job / how you deal with stressful scenarios if you're leaving due to an unhealthy workplace? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64lyr8?context=5)|I ask that question right away and if they start bad mouthing their current employer I tend to shut down the interview pretty quickly.  You can explain a situation by painting a picture of what is making the workplace unhealthy.  If you have an a hole for a boss, don't say that, give an example of how he/she treats people.  Does that make sense?  
[What is your take on hiring veterans who have college degrees?  Does being a veteran matter at all and influence potential employers?  If it does, please explain how.  Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64fmr1?context=5)|Personally I will do everything I can to hire a veteran, and I can tell you that the president of our company thinks the same way.  I guess the trick is to be able to show how your military experience directly relates to the position you are seeking.  Best of luck!
[I have two questions,  1.\) Why is it that most companies will not contact you if you didn't get the job?  2.\) Since applying to jobs online proves to be one of the worst methods with around a 4% success rate (What Color is Your Parachute by Richard N. Bolles\), what are some better methods to an effective job search? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64g17w?context=5)|Hi, first question is a pet peeve of mine since I always try and call the people that interviewed and weren't selected.  I have two answers, one is that people don't like giving people bad news and the second is that some HR people think they don't have the time, which sucks.  I find open positions online and then hunt down the players.  There are wonderful social and business networking tools that are very effective at assisting with the job search process.  Use LinkedIn, use twitter, use facebook and try and find a recruiter that specializes in your field.
[Is it socially acceptable after finding these people to contact them over LinkedIn or and equivalent source? and should they be contacted them after you apply or before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64gcvw?context=5)|LinkedIn was built for professional networking and always feel free to reach out either before or after replying.  Ask for help, people love to help.  Something like Hi, I am thinking of applying for an Accounting position at BDO and I was wondering if you might have a minute to tell me about your time there?
 |Very non-threatening and you aren't beating them up to help you get the job.  You will be amazed at what might come of just a short note.
[Difficult situation...  My SO was fired 18 months ago and is finally looking for a job seriously now. He was fired after 7 years for not-optimal attendance, and has only a high school GED. But he is very personable and very very intelligent.  Again, not-ideal situation overall...  What's his best avenue he could use to find a mediocre but non-crappy job... something full time in an office environment doing something like billing or customer service, 35k-40kish/year? Hire a professional resume writer? Should he lie and say he tried running his own business during that 18 month gap? Etc? I already assume the firing circumstances will have to be sugar-coated/border-line lied about because they can't verify that anyway, only that he is not rehireable (right?\) Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64jynk?context=5)|Unemployment starting to run out huh?  So if I understand this correctly he was at his last position for 7 years?  What does he do?  Don't hire a professional resume writer, usually a waste of money.  Don't try and cover a gap by lying, we'll find out.  And you never know what a company contact will say so don't count on them saying only, he is not eligible for rehire, which in and of itself is a problem.  His best avenue right now is probably through a temp employment agency.  They can help with the resume, they get a shitload of job orders and if he gets out there working and does a good job he might get hired permanently.  Cover the gap by telling the truth.  he had attendance issues but was there 7 years, ready to work hard again it has been tough because of the economy, etc.
[I'm 43, no education, and have been running my own engineering consulting company for the last 10 years.  Prior to that I was an independent contractor for 13 years.  I also do a little bit of management consulting, but mostly programming and electrical engineering.  I've worked inside a lot of different companies (20 or so\), which gives me a very broad perspective on what works and what doesn't.  Do I have any hope of transitioning to an executive or management position at a real company?  Would you consider a guy with no education, who's never had a real job?  How can I spin this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64ux0u?context=5)|Love it, ""real company"", like what you have done doesn't count or something.  I would say your best chance would be for a smaller ""real"" company that doesn't have a degree requirement. I am sure you have met a ton of people, network and see what's out there.  So yes, if you want to go that route I think it is possible but you need to be ready to convince someone you really want to take on more of a traditional role.  This is a hard one for me, sorry of I wasn't much help.
[I'm trying to change careers, but my 10 years of experience is mostly in a small family run print shop doing a little bit of everything.  What do I highlight if I want to get into a different field?  Been getting the short end of the stick regarding call backs and so forth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64fgyr?context=5)|You highlight whatever in your background is most relevant to the position you are seeking.  I always tell candidates that switching careers is no easy task and you have to manage your expectations, you may have to settle for something that might seem a bit beneath you before you can actually start to make headway in to a new career. Stay focused and put yourself in the hiring company's shoes, does it make sense for them to hire you for the role?
[I've read articles such as these: Link to www.forbes.com that talk about obesity and salary. Did you find that to be the case? Does it influence hiring too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64f67g?context=5)|Unfortunately it does, people have biases whether well founded or not and employers can make a case that obese people will increase healthcare costs for the company.
[Lately I've been hearing that your degree isn't as important as it used to be when looking for your first job, but that recruiters primarily look at your (social\) and out-of-college activities. Is this actually true?  E.g. if you could pick between two candidates - One with good academic credidentials but 0 experience outside of it - One without a degree, but actively involved in planning and organising things for organisations.  Which would you pick, and why? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64gjq2?context=5)|Personally I would take candidate B without the Degree however most companies now require a 4 year degree for professional positions.  
[Thanks! Does make me wonder why on earth I spent 5 years in college :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64i7j0?context=5)|I'll share something with you, I attended but didn't graduate from college and I regret it to this day.  
[I'm hoping you can provide some guidance on my current situation. I've worked at a startup for a few years now, and am one of the first 10 employees (we have around 100 now\). We're very profitable. I've been in Support for that entire time, but have done a lot of other unrelated things for the company, so I make a bit more than a typical Support rep, around $64k / year.  1\) They want to wait until my annual review in December to adjust salary, despite a start date in October. Is this typical of internal promotions?  2\) They said a jump to an $80k+ salary from where I'm at is out of the question, reasoning that internal promotions are typically not paid market rate. They said a more realistic number is in the low $70s. Are internal promotions typically paid out at a lower rate than external hiring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64it98?context=5)|Probably the best advice that I can give is never hold a current employer hostage over salary, even if you get paid they will be bitter.  We have an employee right now who did this and he doesn't know it but I am looking for his replacement right now.  From an employers perspective a jump to 84K would be a 31% increase which is in my opinion too big of a jump.  When you mention market rate for PMs, is that for an experienced PM?  And how many years of experience?  It is a new role for you so temper your expectations initially, 74K would be a healthy 16% increase and more reasonable I think.  They want to delay the salary increase so that don't have to re-visit it when they do the annual.  Try this, see if you can get 74 starting in October but would agree to no salary discussions in December during your annual.  However, since you believe the market for a good PM is higher, you would like a ""salary"" review in 6 months.
[This is a pretty general question but could you go over interview etiquette?  I.E. what are the best questions to ask, what makes candidates stand out, what are the little things you notice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64evym?context=5)|This has been fun although I am getting hungry, might have to grab lunch.  Have at least 2 or 3 questions, can be general about the company or job specific.  If I am the job seeker I want to know why the position is open, career path from here and ask the interviewer what he likes about his/her job, you can learn a lot.  Always dress professional, even if you think it might be a business casual environment.  Turn off your damn phone, don't forget.  Don't talk too much and give concrete examples when you answer questions. Show interest and at the end of the interview ask for the job.  Some red flags for me are lack of eye contact, inability to tell me what you did or do, no knowledge of the company, etc. Be yourself, be on time.
[I'm currently at a university and will be applying and interview for internships soon. What would be some of the best ways to ask for the job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64q0xb?context=5)|Directly ask, if you really want it.  It never ceases to amaze me that people won't do that.  
[I don't understand. I'd feel like an idiot saying ""I'd like that job please"" since I'm already in the interview and have (hopefully\) appeared to be very interested in the company and the position.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64vayl?context=5)|Close the deal at the end.  Say something like, ""From what I have learned today about xyz company I am really excited about joining the team, what is the next step so that I can start as soon as possible?""  This leaves no doubt in the interviewer's mind as to your interest and will force them to make some type of decision on the spot. 
[What's been the biggest pay increase you've seen in a candidate?  What was their past salary and their newer salary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64enxq?context=5)|Not sure, typical increases are anywhere between 10 and 20%. Usually people don't make huge jumps.

Long story but here goes, back in 2003 I quit a position with a medical staffing company and ended up starting a recruiting business and did ok but my wife didn't appreciate the uncertainty of the business so when one of my clients approached me about joining them as their internal recruiter I took the job.  I helped grow the company from about 20 people to over 150 and then things at the company changed and we started letting people go.  One of the departments that was hit was HR, we let go our Director and generalist.  The President of the company kept me on because he knew that as we restructured and changed the business model we would need to recruit people again at some point.  So I took on all the HR duties and he has allowed me to have my business on the side.  There are some synergies between the roles so it works well.  So I primarily wear my HR hat during the day and my executive search activity is done in the evening and on weekends.

If it is an internal corporate recruiter I wouldn't tell them what I make during the first conversation, period.  Just tell them you would be more comfortable discussing salary at a later time.  If it is a third party recruiter you can usually get by at first by telling them the salary range you are seeking, but they will have to know at some pint exactly what you make.  I usually request W-2's from my candidates before I present them for senior roles.  Hope that helps.

If the range is 30 - 40% above what you are making you have done a great job actually getting through the interview process.  Shoot for 30 and be happy.

zibos,9,2012-09-07,How valuable is the CS Degree in obtaining employment?,lennybird,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zibos/how_valuable_is_the_cs_degree_in_obtaining/,"A friend of mine did a summer internship at Intel. Intriguingly, they told him (I'm paraphrasing), ""90% of what you'll learn in school will not be related to what you'll be doing here."" They then emphasized on-the-job training. This made me a little nervous. Am I wasting my time and money?

Similarly, I've just stumbled across this subreddit. And viewing the advice from others, it appears that a computer-science degree is less about application and programming and more about going into theory (which can be great to expand the mind's capabilities in some instances.).

I'm about half way through obtaining my Bachelors. I'll have obtained more than 64 credits at the community college due to switching from a BA to BS (can only transfer a max of 64 in the end). Following my current path I will have an associates in both arts and sciences after next summer—providing an okay platform to springboard into universities (I'm hoping).

But is it worth it?

Is there anything I learn with this degree that I cannot learn on my own? In regards to willpower, dedication, and ambition, I have no problems teaching myself. And is the portfolio or proving yourself more valuable than the degree?

My interests in the field of programming revolve around web-design (front end, back-end), software design, game development, and entrepreneurial ideas such as apps.

I'm unsure what the specific field/position would be, but I would also love to work on, say, Google's search algorithms, or Reddit or Digg. I would like to be in research, such as the IBM team who worked on Deep Blue or Watson.

In responding, would you mind explaining the path you took with your education and how long you've been in the field? 

Thank you."

zi3z5,0,2012-09-07,HELP! A Christian Republican is debating me on Facebook.,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/zi3z5/help_a_christian_republican_is_debating_me_on/,"I will be quick and to the point - I am a engineering student that works a job and participates in the marching band. I don't have a ton of free time, so I need everyone's help collaborating facts and a counter-argument! I am Josh and he is Matt (with the original status from Dena-she has not responded to any of our comments).; this is our discussion so far:

**Dena (Status)**: So far tonight in Charlotte, God and Jerusalem were booed, a woman spoke who is having so much sex she needs taxpayers to pay for her contraception and now it's time to listen to a speech by a previous President who nearly got impeached for getting serviced in the Oval Office by an intern. Wow.

lots and lots of small arguing with no facts stated...

**Josh (Me)**: As a college student I want to put my two-cents in:
I watched both the RNC and DNC, and the DNC was incredibly impressive when compared to the RNC. Clinton may have had a scandal while in office, but holds an amazing political track record as president. His speech at the DNC completely blew away the RNC and Romney's campaign.

Here it is to watch/listen (please give it a chance-it is fantastic): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzDhk3BHi6Q

Here are two articles fact-checking his speech:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/06/fact-checking-bill-clinton-on-the-economy/

http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-09-06/clinton-fact-check-democratic-convention/57627036/1?csp=ip

And one of the most surprising statements found true:

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/06/bill-clinton-job-creation_n_1861071.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009

Although I am a registered Libertarian, both major parties in politics lie. They lie a lot. But you cannot run from the facts that, proven through history, Democrats have been more successful than Republicans on the economy. Look at many countries in the EU (which typically run on Democrat fundamentals) - even while Greece is collapsing under extreme corruption - like Germany. They have an amazing universal healthcare and education system, and an unemployment currently at 5.5%. I studied abroad in Germany this summer and can say first hand on the quality of the country in every sense. The people were happy, the infrastructure was clean and modernized, and education and healthcare wasn't a luxury for the rich. They have a very strong middle class. Although this post is getting off track - the point is that Democratic policies work more effectively than Republican policies, supporting the economy and the middles class. 

Feel free to comment - I enjoy discussing religion and politics and I will respectfully respond when I get the time.

TL;DR: I am Libertarian voting for Obama in the fall because Democratic policies work more effectively compared to Republican policies.

**Matt**: Josh, How is 3 years of 8%+ unemployment and 16 trillion in debt(6 trillion in the last three years) sucessful? Clinton didn't have a good record on the economy until the conservative republicans balanced the budget. The repubs then started spending just like the dems have done and there was and still is no accountability in DC. What I have seen from the DNC is frankly rather embarrassing. How do you have a voice vote, not like the results, try it two more times and then over rule what clearly was not a majority. That fact was confirmed with a rather large round of booing after it was decided to put god back on the platform. Don't let Clinton's charisma and speaking ability pursuade you. He is a master at both. Look at the results. I don't know much about Germany's current state, but I know that until recently America was far better economically than anything the European models produced for most of my life. Where did the 18 million new applications for food stamps come from? Certainly not those that were already poor. Neither party has been successful because neither party practices conservative fiscal policy. Conservative Fiscal party is admittedly a hardermarketing sell in order to get yourself elected or retained as an incumbant, but it is the only way that we will be able to right the ship that has gone off track.

**Josh**: Matt, thank you for your response! I am very busy tonight preparing for an exam and quiz tomorrow, and won't be able to set a full reply until Saturday.

**Josh (again-I was too tempted)**: Short response: Two wars, a housing sector collapse, and tax cuts under the Bush presidency continued into Obama's presidency, which is responsible for a majority of the federal debt. I'm not one of those people that would blame a certain president for the economy's condition (after all, its not like one man-the president-controls the health of an economy), and I'm neither a person who blindly follows politics (economic and social issues) or political figures without research. All of this will be accurately and methodically detailed out on Saturday. 

Side note: The Democratic platform adding to the convention platform by mentioning of God and declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel is a whole other issue. As far as the adding God - it is ridiculous. A country founded on religious freedom and a secular government should mention no form a deity, ever. Declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel is another issue that I still need to do research on.

**Matt**: Josh, Have we had an attack on American soil since our government decided to be proactive in our defense rather than reactive? Protection will never be perfect, (Fort Hood) but we are much safer because of those wars. Tax cuts are never responsible for debt. Excessive spending is responsible for the debt. One can't go into debt if one doesn't spend more than one takes in. There are valid reasons to deficit spend for a short season, but long term deficit spending will lead to bankruptcy which is what is happening now. Cutting tax rates historically has increased actual spendable revenue (Research revenues before and after Reagan's tax cuts) because people behave more economically when they have a greater return on their investment or their time. The housing collapse was a result of the government, primarily led by dems, insisting banks loan money to people who can't afford it. I experienced that first hand in the 90's when I tried to refinance. It blew me away how much the bank was willing to lend me; Far above my ability to pay. They tweaked the value of the home so that they could get a higher amount approved. I agree its not a one man/woman show. When we vote we need to vote for a system of government not a personality. That is why politicians like Clinton and Obama are so good. They have an ability to get people past how they govern by marketing things like hungry children, sick elderly etc. I applaud you for your research, but statistics can be made to show pre-determined outcomes. Our country was founded on religious freedom because Christians came to America looking for freedom from persecution. Although our government is now secular, a generic reference to ""god"" when most people claim they believe in god is not in appropriate. Should we take in God we trust off of our money? If the dem party wants god taken off its platform it has a right to do so. The political theater that happened the other night was an obvious attempt to cover up that belief because they know it will impact the loyalty some people of faith have to their party. They need these votes to win and keep their power. Look throughout history. (Rome for example)You will find the death of powerful nations comes back to its rejection of Christian principles and the destruction of the family. Both of which are well underway in the US.

Thank you in advance for help, everyone!

EDIT: **TL;DR**: I'm arguing with a Christian Republican on Facebook. I'm busy and need help formulating facts and counter-arguments."

THE FACTS: Clinton, who famously finger-wagged a denial on national television about his sexual relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky and was subsequently impeached in the House on a perjury charge, has had his own uncomfortable moments over telling the truth. ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,"" Clinton told television viewers.

So I am 27 and I have been unemployed for over a year and it doesn't seem as if I am ever going to get  job with my education. I hold a BSc in Biological Sciences (ecology + management focused) and a double MSc in Environmental Science + Management. I had been trying to find work up until a few months ago where I also expanded my search into unpaid internships with no luck. I've applied for jobs that simply ask for a BA/BSc but never get passed the initial round. 

It is too late to apply for the upcoming semester so I will have another year to look for work with what I've got. However, I am considering going back to school for a business degree as there seem to be a lot more jobs in that field. My question now is: Would it be worth it going for a full 3 years BA or could I get away with a 1 or 2 year MA? Is it even worth going back to school at this point?

How bad does it look, given my age, that my CV has (cumulatively) two years worth of internships but no ""real"" job experience? Given that for the last year, the only thing on my CV has been my job at a hotel for the last six months. Pretty bad, right?

I have breaks throughout the day for eating and homework doing, but I don't have any breaks long enough to go back home to cook (my work &amp; university are both in downtown Chicago, and I live in Logan Square - about a 40 minute commute with traffic).

I've been finding myself eating out far too much, since pb&amp;js aren't the most filling sandwich of all time, and I can only eat it twice a day for so many days in a row before I snap and just go buy ""real"" food somewhere. Previous semesters I've lived off a lot of rice &amp; beans and pasta dishes, but since I'm hardly home these days, I'm not really sure how to pack cheap lunches that will last all day. I could get an insulated lunchbox, and I do have access to a microwave, but I figured I'd see if anyone had any other suggestions for fantastically filling cheap food that travels well.

I have an okay resume right now. I've worked on some interesting projects on my own. I have had two fun (and productive) internships.

But it's nothing compared to the resumes of those insanely brilliant people. 

So my question is - how do I go about building credibility on my resume? For me I see the following things with some potential:

- get 'awards'/credible courses (MVP, CCNA, etc)

- publish a paper (which is difficult since I'm out of uni now)

- build some apps that demonstrate my skills

What might be some other options?"
zhpko,2,2012-09-07,Need some advice about becoming a teacher.,GregariousGopher,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zhpko/need_some_advice_about_becoming_a_teacher/,"Sorry for the wall of text...Much appreciation for anyone that reads / comments!

I've recently graduated from college with a BA in Political Science and minor in Psychology. I went to college not really knowing what I wanted to do, and pretty much never found out. I started majoring in Psych and hated it. I did poorly and really disliked my college experience while majoring in it. I decided to pursue Political Science because, for some reason, I became very interested in politics. So I switched majors and loved it. I excelled, making the deans list two semesters in a row, but I never really knew what I would be able to do with my degree. So I had an internship with the city government where my college was located and really enjoyed the work. Unfortunately, city governments haven't finished laying people off so I have had zero luck finding employment (I interned, unpaid, for 6 months with this city). So now I find myself asking, what do I want to do?

In high school I had floated the idea of being a history teacher, but after 11th grade or so, that idea dropped off my radar. I'm not really sure why it did, but I hadn't really thought about the idea of teaching until I moved back home (my fiancee and I are currently living with my parents working part time jobs). 

Now the idea is back on my radar. I keep thinking about it, teaching high school level government. I am passionate about the subject matter and find it fascinating, but I have no real experience teaching. The most I've really done are presentations in college where me and a partner would have to basically teach for a day. We got 2 chapters in a book we were reading, and had to teach it to the class. I had a blast doing it (I did it solo, my partner was useless). I really enjoyed preparing my presentation, making it interactive for the class, making my powerpoint engaging exciting (as exciting as powerpoint can be). Heck, I even brought a giant bag of candy to boost student participation. Another, admittedly silly example, is from my world of warcraft career.

I used to be a guild leader of a successful 25-man raiding guild. One of my favorite parts was helping people become better at the game. I would essentially ""tutor"" them on their class. I would spend an hour or so talking with them via skype or vent, helping them to understand their class, their role in our group, and how to best do their job. I really enjoyed helping people.

So that's my condensed history. My question / predicament is this: I don't have any formal teaching experience, I don't really have any professional experience relating to teaching, so what do I do. How do I find out if teaching as a career is for me? How do I get experience without any experience? What tips / advice can /r/teachers impart unto me?

Thanks for any help you can provide

This will be my first formal/semi-formal shoe purchase of my adult life, and since money is pretty tight, I'd like to know if these are versatile enough to be worn in a professional business atmosphere (interview for an internship). I've read through the sidebar concerning footwear and job interviews, but I haven't been able to clearly determine whether or not these are ""formal"" enough for the professional atmosphere. I feel like I would be okay in them, but I really want to make a solid first impression and show that I can present myself in a professional manner. 

I'm a pretty fit guy and normally wear a size 11 in every pair of boots, sneakers and the like I've owned in the last few years. If these seem like a wise purchase, or if I could be steered in the direction of a more appropriate style of footwear, I would greatly appreciate any feedback, as this opportunity was kind of sprung upon me rather recently, and I am a tad nervous at the moment. I appreciate any and all comments in advance!

I am very competent, and I know I'm a good coder. I am about a year out of school already and have about a year of experience now. About 2 months ago, I was laid off due to company budget, and have been working on my own projects/ going over data structures/algorithms etc. During these 2 months on working on myself, I realized how much I miss school and really regret how I pissed away some really important classes. 

Mind you at this point I'm really on top of my theories/fundementals, but I know I could learn more and I want to work at a company like Microsoft/Google/Amazon. The problem is actually getting the interview. 

So lately, I started thinking about trying to go to grad school (and actually striving for a 4.0), and trying to get an internship at google/microsoft while there. However, I don't want to go to just any grad school, I want to go to a top one like -- carnegie mellon, or..UC berkeley. I have a year of experience already, and I know my stuff, and I know for a fact given the opportunity to go to a great school I would definitely obtain a good GPA, however, I feel like my 2.8 undergrad GPA is essentially going to screw me in the ass when applying. 

Do I have any shot at this? Is there any way to prove to the college recruiters/ or to whomever looks at the applications that I would do well there? 

Also, is it even worth going back to school? Perhaps I can just find a lower end job and just get paid, create projects and teach myself for a couple of years then try to apply to the big companies? Any tips would be awesome.

zho37,12,2012-09-07,"My rational physician mom is voting for Romney because she thinks the Repubs have the right idea about ""not giving more money to trash"". How the hell do you combat this worldview? Can it be argued with?",[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/zho37/my_rational_physician_mom_is_voting_for_romney/,"My mother does not look like your stereotypical Reddit-approved Republican voter. She is a minority who is well-educated, with a science background, staunchly atheist, and anti-patriotic. She is racist and classist, but I believe no more so than many Americans in the privacy of their own homes. 

The reason she votes for Romney is because she thinks it's fair for rich people to dodge taxes because ""I wouldn't want to give more money to the poor either"". She wants to get rid of Medicaid and welfare *completely* and thinks that the poor are all lazy drug addicts who refuse to work and cheat the system, thanks to her experience as a doctor in a low-income community. Essentially, her entire reason for voting Republican is to de-fund Medicaid, and everyone in her physicians' circles feels the same way.

I don't get it. The only reason she could go to medical school in the first place was thanks to a (communist) government funding her entire education. When she arrived in America she was poor in terms of money, but not in human capital because *she had a medical degree*. In fact, the only reason she got to come to America in the first place was due to a PUBLIC university with PUBLIC science funding paying for her salary. 

She has it in her head that the only reason she's reasonably well-off now was because she worked harder than other people, so she deserves lower taxes and shouldn't have to ""help"" lazy people. But the only reason she had these opportunities in the first place was *due to other people's taxes.* I'm proud of her for taking advantage of these opportunities, but she can't see that other people don't have the same opportunities, or that other people can work their ass off and never become upper-middle-class, or that quite frankly not everyone is born with the brain capacity to become engineers and computer scientists and *it's not just a matter of laziness*. 

I do think that sometimes culture is the problem, as much as systematic issues and the death of blue-collar and manufacturing jobs that has created a gap between ""unemployment"" and ""white collar jobs that require internships poor people can't afford"". I think that too often American parents do not push their kids to work hard in school and succeed in math and science and academics, and that is a problem as much as education funding and poor teaching methodology. But I also think that we are demanding that our poor be Supermen who can overcome the culture they grow up in - the drugs, the gangs, the lack of parental support, the need to work while others are developing their human capital through studying and internships - while being satisfied that people like Mitt Romney aren't *too* evil, even though they're spectacularly greedy because ""hey, I'd be greedy too if I were rich"". 

Most of all, I don't believe the answer is punishment. The reason I don't count on the existence of Supermen (if you starve them enough) is because I am a pragmatist, not an idealist. I don't know what the answer is, but I know it's not depriving someone of access to basic needs. I can understand many traditional fiscal Conservative desires like small government, but I just don't understand this urge to punish, or this notion that most of our taxes are going to welfare queens and Medicaid cheats. 

I see a lot of moderate people claiming that both parties have the same fundamental vision, but different ideas on how best to get there. From personal experience, I have to disagree - I think my mom and I fundamentally prioritize different principles, where she cares more about ""personal freedom"" and ""fair taxes"" while I care more about ""personal responsibility"", ""fair opportunities"", and equal access to this freedom. So my question is: with the kind of argument she and the Republicans make, is it a matter of personal ethics, or of being lied to about the real world? Can it be combated with logic, reasoning, and real numbers; or are we simply too different in values, such that we're not even working towards the same vision?

**tl;dr: I don't believe Republicans are crazy or evil, but I cannot accept this kind of moralism. How can we address it with reasoning, logic, and real-world data? Can someone help me construct an argument, or can this worldview not be reasoned with?**"

zhiks,3,2012-09-06,"Was I over-reacting to his drinking? F28, M34",igotapicklehey,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zhiks/was_i_overreacting_to_his_drinking_f28_m34/,"So I broke up with the guy I was dating for around 2.5 years. We have known eachother (not well, for 10+ years).  Around 1.5 years of the relationship was long distance.  He has had a drinking problem in the past, but claims to be over it.  He previously passed out drunk with a candle on (with the stove on to burn the wax better) and woke up to a house filled with smoke several years ago after his last relationship with another girl.  During this time he would wake up and drink first thing in the morning.  

Fast forward to our relationship, weekends mostly with him or me (mostly him) driving to see me 4 hours or so each way.  I was in an internship, could not really get any time off.  When we were together he would drink, consistently, every weekend.  I had commented on his drinking, basically told him that I thought he should cut back a bit.  I never expected him to stop drinking.  

So I come home, turns out he is drinking a minimum of 6 beers (Natural Ice no less) a night.  He needs it to sleep.  Ok, limit it to 3 I say in 6 months.  Does not happen.  All of our fights are over drinking.  Intermittently him crying...saying you are right, I need to limit it.  Ok....so he moves in.  I figure out that he is hiding his alcohol from me, around 7 or 8 a night.  I confront him, several times.  I come home one day from work, he is gone, all his stuff moved back into his house that he tried to burn down accidentally (which is in a crap neighborhood, house was broken into 3 times in 2 weeks several years ago). We were both unhappy, and no fight ever got resolved. 

His argument is that I was being unreasonable and controlling.  My side is he needs the alcohol to sleep, without it, he cannot sleep.  With it he still wakes up at 3am.  Takes him at least a week (which he has stopped drinking for a week twice in our relationship according to him) to 'get back to normal.'  Otherwise, he drinks EVERY DAY. He hides it from me and lies about it until I confront him with proof (I know major issue right here).  He says that the amount is normal, I just have not been around 'normal drinkers' before.  His justifications include that it is the amount per hour and that he is a normal sized man, so that amount of alcohol is 'normal.'  Also, people call me doctor at work, he never went to college, so anytime he gets offended it instantly becomes me looking down on him (which sometimes I suppose it was).  

So my question is this:  Was I unreasonable?  I know the lying about the alcohol thing is a major problem, but he claims he did it to avoid the fight.  "

zhi57,1,2012-09-06,Lost and confused. What should I (22F) do with 4 year bf(23M)? Long post.,theconstantjuggler,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zhi57/lost_and_confused_what_should_i_22f_do_with_4/,"My boyfriend and I are coming up to our 4 year anniversary. But I want to be single. He and I are best friends and the reason I'm hesitating is because 
1) I'm scared that I'll make a huge mistake and regret it forever. 
2) I don't want to hurt either of us. 
3) We've been talking about getting married and having babies for like 3 1/2 years. 
4) We're living with his dad at the moment so that I can save up and go on an international internship next year - logistical nightmare.
5) I love his mum and little sisters to death. 
6) He is the most important person in the world to me.

Earlier this year I cheated on him with a girl i had been pursuing (I'm bisexual). I felt absolutely awful for it and eventually he forgave me. I can't help still feeling like I want to be with other people. I dream about being with others every night and I don't even feel guilty about wanting to be with someone else (though I won't cheat again). It was at the beginning of the year that I told him I would want to take a break over summer (Sth hemisphere), where we would both be free to pursue other people and I would have a chance to get my independence back. He's been up and down ever since, sometimes being very understanding and other times being incredibly cold. He can be negative and pessimistic, anti-social and unrealistic. He is also incredibly un-ambitious. I try to be positive and am very ambitious. When we met he was at uni but the next year he just started working full time, everyday talking about how much he hated his job. 

For the first year of our relationship we were both just loved up, living together and smoking weed too much. I realised that that was not the way I wanted to live my life and toned it down. Last year it became harder for us to source but then ""legal cannabis"" came onto the market. We went from buying a pack every other week to him buying a pack every other day. This year he would smoke it before work and constantly in the evenings. I would have one cone and be done but he would just smoke sooo much. A few months ago I was looking for a packet I had bought the day before. He swore black and white that he had no idea where it was, i even found the empty pack in the bin and he denied everything. We went for a walk and he admitted his lie, saying that he has been smoking before work every day when I've accused him. --Basically I would accuse him of smoking it (i can smell it), he would deny it, I would put on the pressure and he would get very, very nasty calling me a control freak and a nazi. --The fact that he'd been lying the entire time really took its toll on me emotionally. he promised he would never lie again and then a week ago he lied to my face - again, then quickly told the truth.

One more thing that really hurt me was when I opened up about my depression, the catalyst being my estranged father's death 2 years ago. He said ""I don't think you're depressed, I think you want to be depressed"" Here I was, feeling suicidal, trying to open up to my soulmate and he was just shutting me down. I said it was the nastiest thing anyone has ever said to me.

But he also is so loving, caring, funny, sweet. We still laugh and cuddle and kiss and fuck but I feel like this isn't where I want to be anymore. 

I don't know if I should stay and fix this or leave it now.

If I wait until November when i go overseas, I'll want to do it before I leave so that I can just be single and enjoy myself over there. I'm only going for 2 months and I don't know how I'll feel at the end of it.

Long post I'm sorry, this is my first on Reddit.

couple months ago, I was looking for an internship and I found this one where I would be working for a big mining company. Which is 1000km away from home. 

I applied and got it. But then I took a closer look and the work I would have to do wasn't interesting, that would be a boring internship. I said might as well try it. 

Then 1 month before the start of the intership, I was begining to make these panic attacks more and more often, I was really scared of what it would be and how could I make it. 

I started two days ago and I just realized that I would not make it through the four months that I have to do here. So I took the decision to quit. Tomorow I'm flying back home and I have to call the company to tell them they are not going to see me again. 

Just wanted to share my story.

zhgz7,1,2012-09-06,"Why is the election so close? Because Republican talking points work! Don't complain about how ""racist"" or ""sexist"" they are! That wont change them! Confront them!",[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/zhgz7/why_is_the_election_so_close_because_republican/,"Good evening Reddit. I hope your day went well.

I was in Fairfield, TX recently which is a small town in east texas along I-45. Conservative, friendly (Im blonde though) and hot. I was in Fairfield for a week for work (oil business) so I had time to have a political conversation pop up here and there. One day during lunch I go cornered into giving my opinion about Mitt Romney. I had stayed silent the past 4 days, letting the locals have their say for fear of outing myself as a liberal and having every conversation be some kind of political battle. 

Once they got over my liberalism, I ended up having to spend the rest of every meal defending my opinions. But the experience did give me a great glimpse into WHY this election is *still so close*. This crowd was not very political. They weren't news junkies, they didnt browse reddit, they watch the local nightly news and maybe listen to Rush or Watch a little Fox when they feel like it. The fact of the matter is **conservtive talking points work**.

A majority of my conversations spent defending Obama was spent fighting a Fox's Obama. The major arguments brought out AGAINST Obama at my meals are as follows:

1. He is a muslim.

1. He put the economy into recession.

1. He hates the oil industry and wants to shut it down.

1. He put is in debt.

1. He was not vetted enough before he came into office, we know nothing about him.

1. He is a socialist. (which goes with government should run like a business)


(Now remember, these are just average folks. They are not plugged into reddit or 4chan or xbox. They are all older than 35)

That's a steep climb. The only woman in the bunch was the one who brought up Obama's ""muslim leanings."" When I told her ""He's not muslim... he says he's christian, heck he was attacked for his church having too black of an flavor."" ""He is a muslim. Barack HUSSEIN Obama. Sounds pretty muslim to me, "" she sneered. *facepalm*.

I attempted to rebut each one as politely as I could since I still had to work with these people. I did an okay job. Here were my defending remarks:

1. He's not a muslim. 

1. January 2009 US Economy lost 750,000 jobs. Last month it gained 85,000 jobs. (I was close for that month). He turned it around with the stimulus. (this required me to explain the diference between TARP and the stimulus and Quantitative Easing. No one at the table knew TARP was a Bush legacy.)

1. I didnt even know what to say to this. I pointed out that oil production was higher under Obama than under Bush, but they brought up the keystone pipeline and my explanations were not as easy to understand (plus I bet i did a shitty job) as ""he shut it down"".

1. I had to explain the difference between budget deficit and debt, once I got that across I failed to make them understand that policy;s enacted by one president carry over to the next and affect the new president's budget. I brought up cheney's famous ""deficits dont matter"".

1. I pointed out he wrote an autobiography and was put under constant scrutiny. We know nothing about him yet we know he some how harbour secret muslim socialist leanings?

1. I asked them what they thought a socialist was and the conversation went back to the muslim point.


**My point in writing all this is this: TALK. I might not have made anyone at that table get up and say ""Oh lordy Lord, my eyes are open, Imma vote for Barack HUSSEIN obama"", but I challenged their view and they challenged mine. Even if I didnt get them to convert to liberalism I gave them something to think about and ponder. Go out and talk to pople! Democrats wont win this election if we just assume everyone will go out and fact check or researchthings on thier own. TALK to people. Get the points we circlejerk about here on Reddit out into the real world.**

*As a sample of what ""the other side"" thinks here is a chain letter I got today in my inbox about Mitt Romeny:*

WHY MITT ROMNEY IS DISLIKED? 

A lot is being said in the liberal media about Mitt Romney not being ""likable"" or that he doesn't ""relate well"" to people. Frankly, we struggled to understand why. So after much research, we have come up with a Top Ten List to explain this ""unlikablility."" 

The Top Ten Reasons To Dislike Mitt Romney: 

1. Drop-dead, collar-ad handsome with gracious, statesmanlike aura. Looks like every central casting's #1 choice for Commander-in-Chief. 

2. Been married to one woman his entire life, and has been faithful to her, including through her bouts with breast cancer and multiple sclerosis. 

3. No scandals or skeletons in his closet. (How boring is that?) 

4. Can't speak in a fake, southern, ""black preacher voice"" when necessary. 

5. Highly intelligent. Graduated cum laude from both Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School ... and by the way, his academic records are NOT sealed. 

6. Doesn't smoke or drink alcohol, and has never done drugs, not even in the counter-culture age when he went to college. Too square for today's America? 

7. Represents an America of ""yesterday"", where people believed in God, went to Church, didn't screw around and worked hard to become successful! 

8. Has a family of five great sons ... and none of them have police records or are in drug rehab. But of course, they were raised by a stay-at-home mom, and that ""choice"" deserves America's scorn? 

9. Oh yes, he's a Mormon. We need to be very afraid of that very strange religion that teaches its members to be clean-living, patriotic, fiscally conservative, charitable, self-reliant, and honest. 

10. And finally ... pundits say because of his wealth, he can't relate to ordinary Americans. I guess that's because he made that money himself, as opposed to marrying it or inheriting it from Dad. 

Apparently, he didn't understand that actually working at a job and earning your own money made you unrelatable to Americans. 

My goodness, it's a strange world, isn't it?

He was President and CEO of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. 

In 2002, he was elected Governor of the State of Massachusetts where he eliminated a 1.5 billion deficit. 

Some Interesting Facts about Romney: 

Bain Capital, starting with one small office supply store in Massachusetts, turned it into Staples; now over 2,000 stores employing 90,000 people. 

Bain Capital also worked to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply and many others. 

He was an unpaid volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign 1 year. 

He was an unpaid intern in his dad's governor's office for eight years. 

He was an unpaid bishop and state president of his church for ten years. 

He was an unpaid President of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee for three years. 

He took no salary and was the unpaid Governor of Massachusetts for four years. 

He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity. 

Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest self-made men in our country but has given more back to its citizens in terms of money, service and time than most men. Since when it is a sin to be wealthy?
Don't we all strive to work, sacrifice, save and increase our wealth to have a golden nest egg? 

And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost 19% of his income... Just for comparison purposes, Obama gave 1% and Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%.


Mitt Romney is Trustworthy: 

He will show us his birth certificate 

He will show us his high school and college transcripts. 

He will show us his social security card. 

He will show us his law degree. 

He will show us his draft notice. 

He will show us his medical records. 

He will show us he has nothing to hide. 

Mitt Romney's background, experience and trustworthiness show him to be a great leader and an excellent citizen for President of the United States. 

You may think that Romney may not be the best representative the Republicans could have selected. At least I know what religion he is, and that he won't desecrate the flag, bow down to foreign powers, or practice fiscal irresponsibility. I know he has the ability to turn this financial debacle that the current regime has gotten us into. 

We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but someone with Romney's background can do it. 

But, on the minus side, he never was a ""Community Organizer"", never took drugs or smoked pot, never got drunk, did not associate with communists or terrorists, nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for God to damn the U S. 


TL;DR: Talk to people of different political view points in the real world face-to-face. There are a lot of lies out there that only come to light by talking about them.

zhcnq,3,2012-09-06,Recent graduate treading water. Coach?,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/zhcnq/recent_graduate_treading_water_coach/,"I graduated in May with a BA in Philosophy and Creative Writing. I did well in school, won a few writing competitions, ended up being commencement speaker, found a lot of validation, yada, yada, yada, great success woo.

I live in LA now. I don't love movies or television but I moved here because family member had serious connections in the entertainment industry.

It didn’t pan out. I was naive, assuming the barriers for entry would be lower for me. I don't like television or movies nearly enough to slog the shit that needs slogging, the shit covering the road to a television writing gig.

No thanks.

I've been writing, one freelance article for a small magazine in the Northwest, but mostly for myself - a few short stories that still need finishing, but… no one demanding them, I'm not finishing them! (fuck you, brain.)

I'm paralyzed by my anxiety. I'm anxious because nothing is going on and there's no structure to my days and I don't see an end for it either; I don't know what I could be be good at aside from writing. I'm not trained for anything else and it’s not like I’m a David Foster Wallace or a Cormac McCarthy exploding with a talent that the whole world notices.

I don't have a clear sense of where to put my focus, what I should be aiming for. I'm not even sure if I should be Los Angeles if I'm not trying to do Hollywood. If I could get a job writing for a magazine that would be great but be realistic - it’s not going to happen except for freelance.

That doesn’t work - freelance doesn’t structure your days and freelance needs constant self-starting motivation. On top of that, there’s no consistency. I need structure. I need something consistent.

I guess there’s options out there - well, sort of - not really without the qualifications but I don't know what kind of job I should even be trying to get, what kind of job that will lead me to something I won't hate (the only hobbies that survived more than a brief love affair: writing, reading, music, pot, and magic cards). More importantly, a job I can actually get with my experience, which is limited to having worked on a lit magazine, co-founded another on my own, and writing for a PR agency as an intern.

I'd really like some advice, Reddit.

I know that I'm not in any rush. I'm only 22 but I need to find something to base my days around, something to give me structure. Hey, maybe even something that will teach me a useful thing or two. I don't know what I'm interested in; I haven't tried enough stuff. But I’ll tell you: I’d really like to walk down a road and get to the end of it instead of just hopping off in the middle, embarrassing myself in front of expectations.

TL;DR - ADD combined, closer to inattention - plus anxiety. I don't know what to do because I'm anxious, under-qualified, and ignorant of my options."

We met at work in Chicago, and pretty soon, we were spending 24 hours a day together. We would awake in her place or mine, get ready for work, and take the bus to our job. Spent the evenings together, and repeat the next day. This went on for 2+ years.

We were independent too. She had her passions and friends, and I had mine. So we would also go our separate ways for entertainment. But since we spent so much time together, we REALLY got to know each other.

I proposed after 9 months, and we got married in May last year. Great marriage, great relationship. Simply put, we were each others favorite person. 

In May of this year, I got offered a job in Austin. It was as close to a dream job as I could get in my career. They were going to allow me to work long distance, but through the encouragement of my wife, I accepted the job, and we planned our move. 

I was nervous the entire time, and was saddened to leave our condo, friends, and in-laws. She comforted me, and motivated me to move as we were ""young and adventurous"". 

She was going to have to stay behind for a month to finish up the summer semester of college where she is studying Justice Studies. Her last semester just required her to finish an internship, which she got permission to finish in Austin. She was so close to being done. So I moved at the end of July, and she was supposed to join me 8/22.

She got here, and then everything changed.

She acted semi-normal, but I could tell she wasn't happy. Not as happy as I was to see her. I was pretty lonely here, as I don't have a way to get around really. (She kept the car in Chicago, and I bought a bike down here to get around in 100 degree weather). Distance made my heart grow fonder. It wasn't the same for her.

She opened up and told me that she was really sad, and didn't really know why. We sort of chalked it up to homesickness. But she went on about all the opportunities she is leaving behind in Chicago; the classmates that she'll miss, the professors that are championing her career. She started to show signs of depression, and it was obvious she didn't want to be in Austin. She was barely affectionate, and wasn't the same loving wife that I knew so well. She basically did not want to be here.

After a few talks, I suggested that she go back to Chicago to finish the semester. If it was the only way that she was going to shake the sadness, it was all I could do. She agreed, and suddenly everything seemed fine. Once she knew she could go back, she saw light at the end of the tunnel.

I started to question if something happened in that month apart. She denied it, and did a mediocre job of convincing me that she still cared deeply for me. But I did start to question if she still cared about me. I mean, how could she leave me here in Austin for months while she tries to shake the sadness?

She went back on Monday, and honestly, I'm 100% miserable. I feel abandoned. I don't know anyone here, and I only have a bike so going to bars means showing up drenched in sweat. We can't afford another car (that she took back to Chicago since she needs it a bit more than me), since we are a single income family as she finishes her degree. We talk, and all I can try to do is support her and hope that she shakes the depression and wants to come back.

Bottom line, it's not the loneliness. It's the feeling of abandonment.  

I'm cracking. (signed up for therapy and everything)

But what do I do, guys? How can I get through this? Was I right to try to help her figure it out?

tl;dr Wife was supposed to move with me to Austin. She came, got depressed, and went back ""temporarily"""

Since the beginning of the year, I've upped my law school grades, dropped 50 pounds, and gotten on top of my finances. All is going pretty well (and I am much better at dealing with any blips along the way, like a loan issue I'm having). I'm juggling everything just fine, feeling great in virtually every way.

The other day, I get a call from my mom (who I moved across the country from two years ago for school). She has cancer, aggressive invasive breast cancer. Diagnosed last week, I talked to her a couple days ago, and she's calling me tomorrow with test results.

I have no idea what sort of fuckitude I need to give about this. I moved to NJ a couple years ago for law school and will move back home next year (as has always been the plan). Since I moved, my parents split up, divorced, sold the house, put one of my dogs to sleep (he was sick, it's not a horrible offense or anything), and have moved on with new relationships. My entire family on my mom's side is dying (grandmother with congestive heart disease, two aunts with sudden terminal cancer diagnoses) and now my mom has cancer. I feel like half of me has disappeared (since once those family members are gone, nothing is left of that branch, unlike my dad's massive family). 

I'm upset, I can say that much. I'm scared for my mom. I'm scared about the genetic tests that she's calling with the results for tomorrow; her doctors are concerned that this is something that impacts me. I feel bad that I think about myself at all. I'm upset that I'm losing my whole mom's side of the family, especially since she and my dad split up (like why do they matter at all). I'm sad that I have no one to talk to about any of it (my dad and boyfriend, who I talk to about everything, hate her and I have no alternate social life). And I'm in my final year of law school and dealing with all the stress that goes along with that and feel completely shitty about *that* (what the hell are some classes or an unpaid internship when someone else is dealing with dying?). 

I guess I want some feedback before I hit a wall. I know how to be depressed and what it's like to want to kill myself; I've dealt with that more than I want to think about (2004-2012). I don't want that anymore, but it's easy to be a honey badger when everything is fine or when your worries are really meaningless. I feel okay now, but I can just see it coming, like the world's longest train wreck. After I get that call tomorrow, or after a week, or a month, or more bad news, I'm going to drop back into that self destructive shit again. And that scares the hell out of me.

Any advice would be very much appreciated.

**TL;DR: Honey-badgering my way through life, just found out my mom has cancer. Afraid all the shit I've been so successfully juggling will come crashing down.**"

Since it was an internship, can I just tell potential employer that my internship ended?

zkr0o,1,2012-09-08,Future applicant for a PhD in Clinical Psychology. How can I get excellent letters of recommendation?,[deleted],clinicalpsych,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalpsych/comments/zkr0o/future_applicant_for_a_phd_in_clinical_psychology/,"Hello, I would be appreciative of people's advice on what to do to form strong bonds with professors that will be necessary to get excellent letters of recommendation. Anything anyone has learned through the process of applying to a PhD program will be greatly appreciated too. I know I'm in a good track. Let me tell you what I'm doing in preparation for grad school. 

Also, I'm going to graduate with a B.S in Psychology on Fall 2013, so its not too late to make any changes or improve some things. 

So far, I've volunteered in 5 different labs. I've been in the first lab since last year, it's an I.O lab. The research has been a very slow process. I only interact with the graduate student. The PhD supervisor is usually so busy and supervises a few graduate students, it has been hard for me to create a close relationship with him. Also, my work in the lab has been very simple, and I do everything from home. 

Then, I've been working with a graduate student in the Psychology Clinic, who is supervised by an illustrious Clinical Psychologist. I've had the chance to interact with children, and watch therapy sessions. But I've only met the supervisor once, she is also a very busy person, she supervises other graduate students and is doing an extensive research of her own. I don't know how to get close to her either. 

The other lab is supervised by Psychologists in 3 different areas, one of them a Clinical Psychologist. The project is run by a graduate student in Human Factors, and other grad students in I.O Psychology. I was trained to conduct physiological measurements: EMG, PPG, ECG, EDA. We also use an Arrington  eye-tracker. I've introduced myself to the supervisor, and try to catch him on his free time and talk to him but his office time and my off time do not coincide. 

The other lab, where I just started this summer is a Cross-cultural lab. I'm just handing out surveys, for now. The project is awaiting approval from the IRB for the second part, where I will interact with some of the participants. The supervisor of this project is an amazing professor, I've taken classes with him and next week I plan to go to his office and introduce myself to him so he know who I am.

The other lab, where I started recently, is at the Counseling Center. I'm having fun there because I'm learning how to use SPSS, and I'm getting to know Psychologists and interns who work there. I will be there for a year, so this is the only place I'm certain I can get the most excellent letter of recommendation. 

The reason I'm involved in different labs is because I like to explore what is out there in the field of psychology. So far, all of this research experience has been fun and very enjoyable for me. I don't think working in different research labs will negatively affect my admittance into a program.

Besides my research experience, I'm trying to expose myself to different populations in the community. I volunteer in a hospice, and interact with residents. I'm an Ally at my school, we discuss issues of the LGBTQ community and ways we can provide support for them. Also, I'm a victim advocate through an organization at my school, next summer I plan to volunteer as a victim advocate in the State's Attorney's office.

This semester, I volunteered to teach the Junior Achievement Program to middle school kids, to get a sense on how it is to interact with teens. I also work teaching Spanish to elementary kids. I thought it was a good idea to get teaching experience since it's something I would like to do as well. 

For some time I thought that my main problem was going to get research experience, or get involve in extracurricular activities. But I think everything I'm doing will be good additions in my CV.

My main problem is talking to professors. I know some professors are delighted to talk to students about grad school, and give advice about any concerns but I just cannot come around to talk to the most busiest and brightest people I know. I guess, I become intimidated and think that I will take away their precious time.

I had an internship and a good GPA, but I didn't do much programming outside of class. I also never really mastered topics like algorithms and operating systems. I ended up taking a job that was billed as programming and system administration, which was also new to me. I went on autopilot for years and didn't really think about my career until the last few years, when I realized that my job has become less and less programming. My only programming now is modifying a few lines of code in an existing program, reading source code, or writing a one-off script to automate something. My typical day is modifying some software configuration, swapping hard drives, doing a backup, or trying to fix some Linux problem.

I'm now in a situation where I don't have much real programming experience, and I haven't really developed my sysadmin skills beyond what is necessary for the job, nor do I really like doing administration or working with hardware. My resume apparently still looks impressive because I get contacted by recruiters on LinkedIn for programming jobs, but I don't have the confidence to actually get through a technical interview. 

I'm trying to rectify the situation by working on a side project that has potential to be monetized and will let me learn new frameworks, and taking online courses like on Coursera and Udacity.

zkkea,36,2012-09-08,Tips for Seniors who want to avoid unemployment.,irndk10,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/zkkea/tips_for_seniors_who_want_to_avoid_unemployment/,"Just a little background, I graduated in May with a solid GPA (3.3), but 0 internships and very little CAE experience. This made it very difficult for me to even get an interview. After months of improvement, knowledge, and perseverance I finally landed a dream job with a great offer. Unemployment was a miserable and depressing experience, however, I learned a lot a long the way. I kept finding myself saying ""fuck, I wish I would;ve known to do that"". I'm sure you've heard a lot of these, but I think it's more helpful to hear from someone who recently wen through first hand.


* Hopefully I'm not too late for this one, if you have the choice, choose your senior design project wisely. If you have no internship experience, this will be your major talking point. Make sure it's a project that you are interested in. Do good work and maintain a professional but also personal relationship with your company contact. Many people get job offers through this. This is especially important if you have a less than desirable GPA. They won't care about your GPA if you demonstrated your can produce good work. Even if they can't offer something you have added someone to your network.


* This one is obvious, but go to any career fair your school offers, even if you want to work in another geographic location. It will give you valuable interview experience. Also research the companies beforehand, to give you a talking point. This will also allow you to speak about any other location you are interested in.


* Start skimming job postings now. This is extremely helpful. See what types of opportunities are out there. For example, if you are an ME, you can be in multiple types of design, aeronautics, HVAC, testing, manufacturing and the list goes on. Once you see exactly what's out there, research and decide types are best suited for you. Then, look at the common qualifications associated and use the remainder of your year building towards them. For example, if you want to be a manufacturing engineer, take a production engineering class your last semester and gain a working knowledge of any program commonly listed in job postings. This will go miles.


* Start seriously applying right before your final semester. Like anything, you will get better at job hunting/interviewing the longer you do it. If you start early it gives you more time to figure it all out. 


* I personally recommend using engineerjobs.com as my main job search tool. It compiles searches from multiple job hunting sites. Craigslist is my #2. Nobody thinks of getting an engineering job on craigslist, but they are certainly out there. You have a much higher chance of getting a response, because less people apply, and your resume goes straight to the correct person.


* Develop a somewhat personal relationship with a couple professors. You don't have to kiss ass or work as their research assistant, just be a good student and a alright guy in their eyes. This is easier senior year as classes are smaller and professors tend to respect you a little more. Companies often ask professors for recommendations. As long as you ask them, they may be able to recommend you.

* If you have any sort of connections, utilize them. You can get a lot in life by simply asking.

* Update/Improve your cover letter/resume every few weeks. Just like doing a tough problem, sometimes just walking away from and later returning can really help. I can't tell you how many times I revised my resume/cover letter and said to myself ""well that's as good as I can possibly do."" only to come back 2 weeks later and saying ""wow I can definitely improve this area."" Also try to make your cover letter semi custom. I had a template and just went off that for every posting. My cover letter was 85% the same every time, but it still had that personalized feel.

* One more thing. Go back and skim any labs or projects that you have done in your Jr and Sr year just to jog your memory on what you actually did. Every once in awhile an interviewer will ask you about your experience with something. A lot of times you can use your experience with a simple lab or project to talk about. They eat that shit up. It's what got me an on site interview with the job I recently got. 


Cold calling/emailing random companies didn't seem to help. In my experience 90% don't answer and the other 10% turned me down, so don't waste your time.


There are a few more that are slipping my mind, This was more geared towards someone who who doesn't have a great GPA, internship experience or connections. I know it's not great, but it's something.

zkkdv,2,2012-09-08,Tomorrow is Day 1 (hopefully). (Questions about cold turkey/cutting down),[deleted],stopsmoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/zkkdv/tomorrow_is_day_1_hopefully_questions_about_cold/,"Found this subreddit, read for a bit. Decided reading about smoking made me want to smoke and went and had one. Woops. 

I'm going to quit tonight/tomorrow. I have 2 cigarettes left right now. (Edit: They are now gone within a hour of my post. Damn.)
However, I'm wondering I should just wean myself off rather than cold turkey. 

I've had 3 rounds of smoking since I was 19. The first time I started I smoked only 5-7 cigarettes a day. I quit after 5 months when I started seeing a new girl. 

I picked it up again after I broke up with that girl. Then I smoked about 5-10 a day. I quit again for another girl after about 6 months of smoking. 

Currently, I have been smoking for about 6-8 months. (First two months, just at work, only on weekends). Then, my fiance went off to an internship. Combined with her being gone (she hates it) and grad school, I picked it up again full time and began smoking up to a pack a day at the worst, but usually about 15. 

My fiancee is returning from her most recent internship at the end of the month. I would like to have gotten over the irritability for the most part by then. 

However, I do not currently have the will I have had in the past to quit. I am quitting only because she hates it, and I want to have a long healthy life with her. I enjoy smoking though. 

I'm thinking it might be best for me to cut down over time rather than cold turkey. Previously I've always gone cold turkey but I've never smoked this much for so long. Seeing the different apps available for weaning off smoking is really intriguing. I've had remarkable success using apps to count and track my calories to keep my diet healthy and lose some weight. I'm pretty good at following the pattern and routine that the apps provide, and I don't deviate. 

Does any one have any suggestions or recommendations between cold turkey and using the apps to cut down over time? I know if I want to be over the irritability ASAP I need to cold turkey, but I'm not sure I have the will, especially working with other smokers. 

**Update edit**: It's now been just about 24 hours since my last smoke. I got through the day at work reasonably well I think. I started off the morning in a fog for sure. There were a couple times I found myself walking out of the office, reaching for where I typically keep my pack. But, luckily I put a bunch of gum there this morning! So I just relaxed outside, enjoyed my gum for a few minutes, and breathed some fresh air. 

Of course, I went through the whole damn pack of gum today, but it's better than smoking still. Headaches and irritability haven't set in yet. Now I have to leave work and go home and try to resist some more. I managed last night. I can do it again.

I had an internship over the summer at Jefferson Lab (an accelerator facility) but they're in the process of trying to decrease their staff so I don't think I'll have much luck there. 

So basically, I'm asking if you're employed, how did you get your job? Bonus points if you got it straight out of college. Maybe SLAC would be a good place to look into? Any input on it? Also, I hear Austrailia is a bit shorthanded, I've seen a lot on Reddit about them needing engineers and the biggest problem being cost of living there, but I'd still be interested and if you have any sites or whatever about jobs available there or how to get one, it'd be appreciated."

zkggg,0,2012-09-08,I need help reporting abusive behavior by an exec director...,Hana3487,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zkggg/i_need_help_reporting_abusive_behavior_by_an_exec/,"I was recently hired as an intern for a nonprofit. On my first day, the Executive Director, who was supposed to be training me, was extremely degrading and patronizing in his behavior. He scolded me for not doing my job, and often wouldn't even explain exactly what I had done wrong. When he told me that I had a bad attitude and that if I didn't watch out he'd hire someone else, he wouldn't give me any examples of what I had actually done wrong. After giving me a task, he would call me over to his desk every 20 to 30 minutes to remind me that work had to get done fast. 

During that same day, there was another woman (S) ""shadowing"" me. Rather than sitting down for an interview, my employer had asked this woman to donate a day of work so that he could observe her at work. He did the same thing with me. He was also very rude to this woman and almost had her in tears. 

At the end of the day, He refused to give me employment papers even though I had already worked a full day.

The next day, I sent my employer this email explaining how I felt about the situation:

I wanted to write you an email to say how very disappointed I am at how I was treated at work yesterday. Not only were you extremely rude to me, but you were unjustly rude to S. Even though you may think of her as a job applicant, she was also a volunteer, and deserves to be treated with the respect and dignity of a volunteer. In my view, even if you do not believe S's work was up to par as a paid intern, she should have at least been thanked for the work that she did do. I have worked with hundreds of volunteers while serving with AmeriCorps, and in that time I have learned that there is a huge range of natural ability and an even greater difference in learning styles. However, almost every single volunteer I have ever encountered--from eleven to eighty years of age--have, at the very least, been deserving of thanks and respect for trying their hardest,

I really do believe that ---- is doing some of the most important work of our time. The modern food industry is literally poisoning the population and we need to stop this trend. I would love to be part of an organization that is doing this great work, but I am not willing to sacrifice my self-respect in the process. I have come to this organization with years of work experience, an education, and superb writing skills that I am happy to utilize for very meager earnings. I love to work hard and I also love to be pushed to be better--but this push must come from a stance of positivity or else we will both be miserable people. I want a happy working environment for myself because I deserve it and because positivity will encourage me to thrive at whatever I attempt.

I understand that you are under a lot of pressure and the lack of sleep might be making you irritable. I am actually concerned that your lack of sleep might be affecting your judgement. You might not even be aware that your behavior is pushing people away and might be the cause of your inability to retain a reliable staff. If after a good night's sleep you believe that you can be polite and treat me with dignity, then I would be happy to return to work on tomorrow. But if you truly believe that you acted justly towards me yesterday, then I quite, because I will not stand for that sort of treatment. 

Sincerely,

H

Of course I never heard a word back.

I truly do believe this man is having some mental and emotional issues. He tended to blank out a lot without realizing it. At one point during the day, he asked me a question that involved multiplying 16 by 2. When I answered 32 he just stared at me with wide eyes until I spelled it out again. The man was actually wearing a shirt that said ""sleep is for the weak,"" and had made at least a few comments about living his work day and night. 


 I would like to contact the board of directors about this incident but I can't find a list anywhere. Can anybody help?"
zkfnc,39,2012-09-08,Still unemployed after over a year - should I just bite the bullet and teach English abroad?,redtrenchcoat,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zkfnc/still_unemployed_after_over_a_year_should_i_just/,"Last November, I was offered a position to go teach English in Japan. Long story short: I turned it down because I felt semi-confident about possibly getting job opportunities in the states. Obviously, that didn't pan out. 

Now I'm thinking that I should have just taken the job opportunity, since it doesn't look like it's going to get any better here. I may have the opportunity again come this November. Have any of you taught English abroad?

zkdyg,10,2012-09-08,The Curious Incident Of The Picture That Could Not Have Been - Part I,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zkdyg/the_curious_incident_of_the_picture_that_could/,"I've submitted my not so paranormal or supernatural stories to r/letsnotmeet, but not everything that happened to me is easily explainable. So I've decided to bless you guys with a small fragment of my life as well.

I have to say I have passion for the paranormal/ supernatural and science-fiction and the occult. Swamp creatures? Time travel? Aliens? Poltergeists? Monsters from the abyss? Demons? Count me in! I think this may possibly be the reason why X-Files, Twilight Zone and Fringe are some of my favorite TV shows. But I am not a believer, I just like to entertain these ideas for goosebumps, food for thought and thrills.

This story is my most dark episode- whether this was an interaction with a spirit, my own psyche or something else- that is for no one to know. PS: The last time I recounted this story to a friend on MSN his power went off, and something made a loud bang. Let's hope nothing sinister is going to happen this time!

Anyway as one single human being I have moved a lot. Overall, if I count all the different apartments/ houses and places I have lived in I come up with the number 22. This is about place number 19, which incidentally was also around the time I was about 19 years old. I was living with my mum in a small flat in Berlin Moabit. Birkenstrasse 13b through the back yard, in the side wing on the 3rd floor. Now living there was already marred by terrible neighbors: one drinking couple who liked to fight on Saturday nights until Sunday morning- first floor, front building. A hobby pornographer/ exhibitionist across the yard in no.13 and an ex - techno DJ who had once ""done the Loveparade"", with a steel door and sketchy friends, constantly re-living his glory days, adjacent to us.

Lets just say we were gunning to move out the moment we moved in.

The apartment itself had a really strange layout. When you first opened the door it would lead into a long narrow corridor which let to a door with a glass panel. This was effectively the real door to our apartment. When you opened that, you got to yet another small hallway. The apartment was tiny. It had a bathroom - no tub, just shower: a living room, quite spacious and light, and a small kitchen. We had arranged the furniture so that the room was separated into two rooms  by a wall of shelves. One side was my room, the other one my mums.

As if strange neighbors weren't enough, after a while the place just felt ""wrong"" to us. Now, I don't know if I can trust my intuition, or if I was at that point just going insane from sleep deprivation on account of my neighbors block rocking beats, but I would constantly have nightmares and wake at 2.30am with the strange feeling in my gut as if, as if ...someone else except me and my mum was there? The same feeling was troubling my mum, but I didn't know at first. We usually have a really strong connection and one night after both waking up at around 2.30h (AGAIN!) we had a brief chat about it.

Now we really didn't think much of it then. And after a while we dismissed it, both us if still waking up at 2.30h or some nights 2.35h, but never varying from that- silently acknowledging the others wakefulness. Lying there, listening intently to the house, the floors and the walls, way into the night as if they could give us any answers.

Now as with most things that are constant, we just ended up getting used to it. We were usually quite messy and chaotic, so when things went missing or were in a different place we attributed this to each other. So for a long while we didn't realize that neither of us was responsible. We were both busy working. I had several internships at the time, my mum was working on a degree in event management. Let's just say our heads had been elsewhere.

Then on around the 29th of November my mum and I got our first digital camera. (Yes we were late, but we got by just fine with analog ones until then!) We messed around with it a lot for the first couple of days. As you do, I guess. Taking pictures of everything- ourselves, each other, every part of our flat, every tree we encountered outside. We had a lot fun of doing that! Though I was shocked to see images of myself and felt digital cameras weren't very flattering to anyone.

At that point we had taken the long corridor and turned it into my study, so this is where my computer resided. My mum hates computers by the way, but more about that later. We were in the smaller corridor and my mum was taking pictures of me in the bathroom ( yes, the silly sausage! Oh look, it's Justus Jonas on the toilet. Oh look, here she is washing her hands!!) she was snapping away, casually reviewing the images, when suddenly the pictures of me started getting a really strange blue ""aura"" for lack of better words. She snapped three distinctive pictures of me with this blue 'thing/stuff' hovering over and behind me.

*Naturally we were bummed out! It was only December the 1st! And we had already broken the damn thing! *

Well, of course I was too curious as to what was appearing on the images! I immediately snatched the camera and hooked it up on my computer. After a few minutes mindlessly zapping through the images from the beginning (past 3 days) as suddenly the screen went 'black'. It was an image file, but it appeared completely black. I was like: ""Oh, how peculiar! Must have done that by accident. Wonder how that happens? Maybe it's a pocket shot, mmh lets play with the contrast.."" Only when I played with it, it didn't show the content of someones pocket or anything abstract. It was a weird and eerily angled picture of my desk. It had the keyboard, some of the mess on my desk and the clotheshorse that was situated next to in view, everything illuminated by a strange ray of light; it was just a streak, as if the front door had only been opened a bit. Everything else beyond the clotheshorse faced into darkness, with only a faint outline of the door leading to bathroom/ bedroom visible.

Now, here is where it gets strange: The date tags for the picture were all in order starting with the 29th of November, going to the 30th, then the 1st of December. The 'picture' was supposedly taken on the 30th of November, the pictures after it where from the 1st of December, soon followed by the pictures we took of me with the blue ""goo/ light/ aura"" in it. So the date was correctly set up- all the other pictures where in order, but on that 'picture' the clotheshorse is EMPTY. On the pictures from the 29th of November, it's full and as I was looking next to me, the same clothes where still hanging there.

The other pictures didn't yield much, it looked rather like a double exposed image, with the image of me over something shiny, blue- ethereal, but at the same time looking solid. For now I was back on to the ""black"" image. At first I didn't really register how very, very disturbing this was. It was only when I showed it to my mum and she went pale, it sunk in. I didn't take this picture, neither did my mum. This picture is OFF, so very, very OFF. When you looked at it, you could just feel a cold shiver running through you. It felt sad and angry in a way really oppressive, dark and menacing. There was no way we took it by accident, because there were no clothes on the clothes horse, which in the entire time we had this camera hadn't happened. There was always clothes on it. So how could it be empty? The light wasn't right either ( our light was directly above, sort of making a circular light mark), the scene was deeply disturbing...but most unsettling was the angle of the picture!!

We allowed ourselves 2 days of trying to recreate the angle, scenario, light, accidental exposure- when by the end of it exhausted and getting quite silly, I stepped on the desk chair and took a picture from that height. Upon checking we both started shaking, tears welled up in our eyes. The picture matched closer than any of our other attempts. However that picture was taken, whatever created the weird streak of light- we did not know, but we did know now, that it was taken from an approximate height of 2 meters.

Now, wild theories sprouted in our heads.. stalkers, ghosts, sleep walking? Has one of us lost it? Possession? Pranks? 

I posted about this picture on a German message board for the paranormal, but nothing useful came off it. I shared it with my friends, but they just didn't want to believe we didn't create it ourselves; didn't comprehend that we tried everything to replicate it. But in so many ways it kick started a reign of terror. Unfortunately, you will have to suspend your disbelief as the picture itself and the pictures of me have now been lost. I didn't think to create a back up and the computer it was on died a few years later.

I will tell you about everything that happened after we discovered that picture in the 2nd part. For now I am exhausted. Let me know if anything eerie happened whilst you were reading this though. ;)

Edit: After reading it aloud, I fixed some spelling/ grammar, didn't I ! ( let me know if there are any more mistakes. Eek!)

[What is your favorite joke to tell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654pd1?context=5)|I really love having Geoff say that he has his robot friends over for a party. And always having Robby the Robot not be invited because he's a dick. I laugh at strange things.
[What are the chances we'll ever see you as a ""real"" guest on the show?  I've always thought it would be interesting to see you guys interact without the robot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654i12?context=5)|Not likely on the show, but I am starting to tour with Craig on his stand-up gigs.

[As someone who often tries his hand at impressions, what is your process behind assuming the voice of a celebrity like Morgan Freeman? Take us behind the scenes, if you could. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654kz7?context=5)|Listening is the main key.

Will Geoff ever move his other arm? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654yb1?context=5)|Thank you! France was cool.

[What ever happened to the old skits that Craig used to do?

[Have you ever used the GP voice on accident while not performing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654od4?context=5)|No. I don't use his voice at all when I'm not doing the show.

(insert creepy Craig face here from the double entendre\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655kl3?context=5)|Not really. I think Ben Stiller, maybe. One of the things I do is called voice matching for movies. When an actor is not available, I record some of their dialogue.

[Does Geoff have something going on with the Reddit robot guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655g8j?context=5)|Probably. He's a sex robot.

[Some of the best stuff (if not the best stuff\) on the show is when you and Craig interact. Has there ever been any discussion of expanding your interactions? Or do you guys even talk about how the show will go?  I just want to see more of Craig and Geoff. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654yk2?context=5)|Thank you! No, we prefer not to plan ahead at all. The one time we did it ruined everything. 
[Why was the big cash prize reduced? Was SAG or Morgan Freeman's lawyers to blame?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655byx?context=5)|Not sure. I'm just the robot, man. ;)

So much happening, it's hard to get together all of the time. We're in a new studio that actually sounds a LOT better, but the mix on our first show back was a bit echo-y toward the end. Glad you're enjoying it. It's my fav thing to do!
[Can't wait! Got any plans to go back on the pretty good podcast? You have some great bits on their show too.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654ytq?context=5)|Sometime soon. I like to space out the appearances so it isn't overkill.

To interesting voices. People you know. Celebs. etc. REcord them somehow. Keep on file. And practice. But most of all: make sure this is REALLY something you love and absolutely want to do.
[Geoff is a blast! He really makes the show. Even my wife who has a limited sense of humor nearly falls off the couch when we watch the show. Any chance you'll take Geoff on the road for gigs with Craig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c6551a4?context=5)|Thanks!

Have some trouble finding a flat/WG. I'm already contacting people like crazy and I use the websites provided by the faq. Yet, I guess it won't hurt to ask if someone has something to offer here.

A few words about me: I'm German, male, turning 18 this month, finished my Abitur this summer and I'm starting an internship in October. I don't live in Berlin yet, the room/flat should hence be available a few days before the start of the internship. I'm quite tolerant and as long as I get my personal space, any roommate should be fine.

My budget is ~400€ max. for warmmiete and the place should at least have a small kitchen included. Work is in Mitte near Wedding and I'd like to live somewhere nearby (Prenzlauer Berg, Tiergarten, Pankow, Moabit, Friedrichshain etc. - you get the picture).

[Why does Windows still have many of the same problems that it had 15 years ago?  Bonus points if you don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.  Also, who's idea is it to, rather than fix existing problems, just pile more crap on top of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64x5jh?context=5)|You really have to understand how Microsoft works for me to answer this question.  Microsoft is not one Borg like company where somebody hands down orders from high above.  Nobody stands on a stage and says 'DON'T FIX PROBLEMS, PILE ON CRAP'.
 |There are people that create overall strategies and guiding principles, but after that it is up to every individual team to decide how to apply them.  And usually its not even a big team, it could just be a single PM, Dev, and Tester who owns a particular feature that will end up making the decision.
 |So you have thousands of these little feature teams that are trying to do the very best they can for the customer given limited time and limited budget (and unfortunately, sometimes limited experience).  Each one looks at their bug backlog, customer requests and feedback, and new features they want to implement.  Not everything fits in the schedule and so they need to decide what gets postponed.  Also keep in mind that new features sell products, just fixing bugs gets you dinged for not being innovative.
 |So for every problem you have in mind, just imagine it being owned by some PM .  He looks at the data and sees that only a couple of customers have complained about it and it has existed for 10 years.  He probably assigns it a P3 (the lowest priority) and moves on to the other 200 problems that he has to evaluate.  He then has to decide which issues are more important than new features which can help customers as well.  At the end of the day, the P3 is what will get cut so that more important work can get done.
 |Also, try to remember all of the problems that you don't have anymore. I love Windows 7, it is by far the best OS I've ever used.  There are hundreds of things that used be painful 15 years ago that I don't even have to think about anymore.  It's easy to notice all of the things that are still problems, but try to have some perspective as well.
 |Now there is one other type of problem that exists in release after release, and those are problems in which fixing it would break backwards compatibility in someway.  99% of the crazy hacks in Windows or weird functionality are done to protect backwards compatibility.  
[*Also keep in mind that new features sell products, just fixing bugs gets you dinged for not being innovative.*  This one line explains it.  Microsoft probably fires developers who make a quality product in order to keep the others 'innovative'.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c6595ar?context=5)|That's not true.  Releases that just have bug fixes are called service packs which Microsoft does all the time, customers expect new features when you release new major versions of a product.  That's all I meant.
[I agree that because of the variety of devices Windows needs to support, Microsoft has a much more complicated beast to tame, but disagree that people will simply jump ship in response to a large change.  Who would they jump ship to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c65k5f3?context=5)|Linux basically.  If corporations were tasked with rewriting everything, they might as well rewrite it on a free platform instead of Microsoft.  Lots of companies are already heading that way on their own, giving them a push by breaking backwards compatibility would be a horrible idea for Microsoft.
[Am I the only one who initially read that as, ""9 year old Microsoft veteran..."" ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64w75i?context=5)|:)  That would have made an even better story. Alas, I'm actually 12 ;)
[How much were you banking with Microsoft ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64w666?context=5)|My last year at Microsoft I made about $225k with bonuses and vesting stock.  The paycheck is definitely the hardest part about striking out on your own, but I don't regret it at all.
[How many hours do you work for the above salary ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64w666?context=5)|I gave everything I had when I worked at Microsoft, it's just how I do things.  A lot of the time that I was putting in 60 - 70 hours a week.  This was mostly because I wasn't interested in managing people so I was producing results that had to compare against people with teams or 10 or more people (Microsoft doesn't calibrate individual contributors differently than managers).
[Why quit before bidkat takes off ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64w666?context=5)|See above :)  I don't do anything halfway and wanted to be able to devote all of my time and energy.
[Were you ever a programmer ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64w666?context=5)|I have a BS and MS in Computer Engineering which involved learning how to program.  I was never a developer at Microsoft but I did create some tools for Program Managers to use and created prototypes for different things.
[Can you explain your patents, how to get software patents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64w666?context=5)|My patents are for obtuse uses for things involving virtual machines, role based security, and differential compression algorithms.  Not sure how many people would find that interesting, but they added to the Microsoft patent war chest.  At Microsoft, everybody is encouraged to apply for patents for novel ideas and they have a process that is streamlined to do so.  Anybody can file a patent though, just need to hire a lawyer which is incredibly expensive to make sure that your patent can be enforced.  I barely could understand my own patents after they went through the legal machinery.  
[What level were you when you started, and when you left?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64x0di?context=5)|Level 59 (Program Manager) when I started, Level 65 (Principle Program Manager) when I left.
[How much did the work load and pay increase through each of the levels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c659s04?context=5)|My work load increased pretty significantly with each level since I had to start competing against leads and later group program managers.  I always had an uncanny ability to take on more and still produce good results.
[Also, did you every think about becoming a lead?  I'm debating on how hard I want to work for a promotion vs. just chilling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c659s04?context=5)|I never wanted to become a lead because managing people isn't my strong suit.  I wanted to become the best PM that I could and I think it took most of those 9 years to achieve my goal.  If you are just thinking about chilling, please think about taking up a job somewhere else.  When you decide to chill, you are not just affecting your career, you inadvertently affect those around you negatively.
[ how the heck did you get promoted that many times in 9 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c659s04?context=5)|I got promoted that many times because I produced more results than anybody else and had an amazing manager that made sure I got rewarded for it.
[What kind of pay did you start at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64xun9?context=5)|$70k base salary.
[How many hit points did you have by the end of your time there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64zabe?context=5)|Around 6.5k, leveling at Microsoft is surprisingly similar to WoW.
[Not bad.jpg.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64xwj1?context=5)|I was very happy coming out of school.
[With some heavy armor and a few more years you could have tanked the Google!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c65369b?context=5)|I hear he's unkillable in this version.  Need to wait for the next patch.
[Did you have any other experience when you got hired? I am graduating in a year, I have made some of my own programs and have lots of programming experience, but have never technically gotten paid to do coding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c651j9s?context=5)|I had experience from paid internships, which probably helped.  These days technology companies are hiring a lot of people out of school and its fine if you don't have real job experience.  I interviewed plenty of people in your position, as long as you know your stuff that's all that matters.  The honest truth is that big companies know that college grads can code and do the work and they can hire you for a relatively small salary compared to people with job experience.  Plus, you haven't learned any 'bad' habits from other companies yet :)  The biggest problem you'll face is just getting your resume in front of the right people.  It's unfortunate but most jobs are filled because somebody knows somebody and can route their resume through the HR jungle.  Having a good LinkedIn network makes a huge difference - for anybody just starting out, connect to everybody you know on LinkedIn. You can never tell who might land in a position that can help you out someday.  LinkedIn is way more important than Facebook in the real world.
[Why is microsoft not allowing us to have a start menu in windows 8? they are actually putting measures in place to make sure we can't install 3rd party start buttons. Why? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64ydei?context=5)|From what I've read in various blogs, it was a design decision that a few people that are pretty high up felt very, very, very strongly about.  I miss it too.
[How much money did you save up for your start-up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64y90h?context=5)|You need to save up enough to support yourself for 3 years when you are doing a start-up.  This includes the money for equipment, hosting, SSL certs, lawyers, etc as well as food, rent/mortgage, and other living expenses.  So that's what I did.  Figure out your costs for a year, double it (you'll always miss expenses) then multiply by 3.  That will give you enough runway to build what you want and give it time to become successful.
[Did you get any investors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64y90h?context=5)|I actually started off my career in hardware - I did VHDL design for Motorola on some of their security processors.  If you love hardware, specialize as much as you can and become the best at it that you can.  At Motorola, I found that upward mobility was pretty limited because the people you are competing against have been doing hardware design since they were using paper and pencil.  It was going to take 8+ years to move up from a junior engineer looking at waveforms all day which is when I decided to move to software.
[Programming and Hardware go hand in hand don't you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64y90h?context=5)|The best thing I found about software is there are a million places to get paid to do it and if you don't like any of those places you can start your own company with a laptop and an Amazon account.  That's something you can never do working in the hardware industry (FPGA or VHDL).
[I'm finishing up my EE degree and currently working in the military RF field.  We have FPGA with clocks up to 2GHz, do you think it would be worth trying to understand both worlds and jumping into a little bit of VHDL or should I stay specialized in hardware?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64y90h?context=5)|Really it all depends on where your passion is though.  Do what you love.
[So basically, you need to make bank in order to do a start up or find investors. :-/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64z549?context=5)|Or drastically minimize your costs.  If you are young and are in college, or just coming out of college this is definitely pretty feasible (and the reason why most start-ups are run by people in their early twenties).  The younger you are, the more risk you can take as well since you generally have less responsibilities.  If you have 3 - 6 month runway, that can be enough it is just much riskier.  But if you fail, the consequences are also generally much smaller (you just need to find a job).
 |As you get older, you have more expenses and more responsibility which makes going down the start-up path a little riskier.  The way people in this situation manage the risk is by having a 3 year runway.
 |In the end, if you are passionate about it, I honestly believe that anybody can find a way.  
[Ever get hit by a flying chair at Microsoft?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64wqzx?context=5)|I almost got punched by a tester once, that was an interesting experience.  No flying chairs though.
[How do you feel about MS longterm especially given the controversy over win8's design? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64wqzx?context=5)|I think Microsoft has a lot of challenges right now to overcome as a company.  I don't think Win8's design is the biggest threat to their long term success. 
[I want to hear he details on you getting punched!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c6597rx?context=5)|It was the weirdest thing.  I was having a very heated discussion with a tester over something pretty minor.  Realizing it wasn't worth fighting for I finally told him, 'Okay, we'll do it your way' but he kept wanting to argue and so I was like 'Why are you still arguing, I agreed to do it the way you want.' then he almost punched me. Instead he punched the glass pane next to my office door and almost broke it.  I kinda wish he had, that was a tough working relationship.
[I'm using Vista on the ""office if @ home pc"" and fooled myself into thinking it's nearly as good as Windows 7 thanks to all the updates.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64xv83?context=5)|Windows 7 is substantially better than Windows Vista no matter how many updates you stick on it.  I would highly recommend an upgrade.
[Am I fooling myself ?  Also, what kind of car do you drive ? :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64xv83?context=5)|I drive a Honda Civic.  We all have different priorities :)
[We can agree that iOS is a child's toy though right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64x58f?context=5)|A very valuable, incredibly well designed, amazingly timely child's toy. Yes.
[Do you have any advice for someone who's joining MSFT fresh out of college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c651vjt?context=5)|Every group at Microsoft is different, try to find one that matches your interests and where you respect the leadership team and enjoy your co-workers.  Every manager is different, finding a good one that has your best interest in mind is a key to success.  While you will be in charge of your career, it is incredibly important to have a manager that will defend you when needed and find opportunities when they come up.  Always do more than your asked, it's expected even if it isn't mentioned.  Look for gaps to fill before anybody realizes that they are gaps.  I built a very successful career just doing that.
[Did you find your hardware experience came in handy while at MSFT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c651vjt?context=5)|I used 0% of what I learned about computer engineering at Microsoft. You will use all of the soft skills though: being able to ramp up quickly on new topics, understanding highly technical issues, solving hard problems, communicating with others, and writing skills.  Nobody will ask you to draw a transistor though ;)
[What are some of the big changes you have seen happen to the company throughout your 9 year duration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c651vjt?context=5)|Microsoft has changed tremendously in the last 10 years.  As the stock price has remained flat, people need to compete with each other to earn more money.  This internal competition isn't healthy and why it's so important to find a good team.  If you PM me the teams that you are looking at, I'd be happy to give you my thoughts.
[How do you feel about SaaS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64xwba?context=5)|SaaS is basically just another name for a web site.  Enterprises couldn't justify spending millions of dollars a year to use a web site, but call it SaaS and they throw money at it.   
[Why did you leave? Were you just unhappy at Microsoft or was it for the urge to start something yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64w59c?context=5)|A little bit of both.  I had been working with an amazing team of people for about 6 years which was a really fun time for me.  But after tackling the same type of challenges for so long, I wanted to try something new so I moved to a different team at Microsoft.  It was at that point that I realized what I was really looking for wasn't at Microsoft. It's been the best decision that I've ever made.
[Learning how to program...can you elaborate on that? Anything specific to learn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c6515di?context=5)|At the minimum, I would say you need to learn enough so that when you need to do accomplish something specific you can Google your way through it.  This means understanding the basics like if statements, for loops, variables, classes, and data structures like arrays, lists and maps.  With a good foundation, the language you end up using to writing your code doesn't really matter.
 |If you can automate Excel or Photoshop, you can save hundreds of hours and make yourself that much more efficient.  If you can make a website you can reach the world.  If you can make a web service or a flash game or an iPhone app you can make a living.  I literally can't think of a single occupation where it would not be a huge advantage to be able to automate tasks or distribute information or provide a service for others.
 |If I asked you to code up a version of the game Hang Man and you knew where to start and could get it working, then you are most of the way there.  Not everybody is going to code for a living and not everyone needs to be a superstar developer (I know I'm not!) but just a basic understanding will open up a lot of opportunities.
 |If you are just starting out [Link to www.khanacademy.org](http://www.khanacademy.org/c) is pretty cool.
[Other than this AMA what are your strategies on getting your product out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64wvn4?context=5)|Advertising on Reddit :)  We've also been reaching out to various blogs and buy-sell forums to get the word out.
 |Our biggest strategy though is somewhat counter intuitive.  We decided not to provide a way on our site to actually see what auctions exist.  This means that it is up to the sellers to post a link to their auctions on things like Twitter, Faceboook, forums, Craigslist, etc.  As sellers work to spread the word about their auction, they are doing an awesome job spreading the word about BidKat as well.
[Over the short run that sounds okay, however over the long run I feel like that could stump your growth.  Why not allow people to have the option of making their auction public/ private, allowing people to search for items.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64xd5p?context=5)|If you give people the option they will just click public and assume that you'll bring in sufficient traffic to sell their item.  We'll lose out on the secondary advertising, which will prevent us from having sufficient traffic to sell their item.  Microsoft and Ebay both tried to compete with Craigslist like this and both failed.  If it didn't work for a billion dollar company, I don't see how it could work for us. 
[Where is your company located?  Were you bootstrapping off your savings? How long until you expect your startup to profit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64wgkq?context=5)|We are located in the beautiful city of Seattle, WA.  Yes, we are bootstrapping this off of savings (taking money from investors too early can be pretty dangerous).  We're expecting it to take about 3 years to turn a profit - which I define as making up for my lost salary.  BidKat is just the first service and not one that we counting on making a lot of money.  It was just an itch that we personally wanted to scratch.
[Why the disconnect between the consistent failure of MSFT where it competes with Apple and Google and the willingness of those in the MSFT ecosystem to criticize top level management?  In other words, why does no one have the guts to say that Steve Balmer has to go? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64zzut?context=5)|Lot's of people say that, both internally and externally to Microsoft.  There are entire articles written up detailing the reasons why he needs to go.  There are a couple of problems though.  First, he still has the full support of Bill Gates.  Second, who would replace him?  Investors look around internally and don't see anybody they really want as CEO for various reasons.  Most also think hiring externally would be a disaster because of the realities of the Microsoft culture.  So say you have the power to kick him out tomorrow -  who do you put in their place and what strategy do they take?
 |Keep in mind that while Microsoft has had lots of failures in the consumer space (personally, I believe Bill Gates was ahead of the curve but the stars didn't align), they are incredibly dominant in the enterprise space and still bring in billions and billions of dollars a quarter.  While the fights with Google (which is personal for Steve) and Apple (which was personal with Jobs) are the most visible, Microsoft directly competes with over 50 different companies and is beating the vast majority of them.

Is he a viable alternative (if the new metro environment is successful\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c657o80?context=5)|Microsoft is a really big place and there are lots of different cultures across the different teams.  That's why when you work there it is really important for you to find a good fit.  Some teams are very developer centered like how they were in the late 90's, some teams are very PM driven and customer focused, and lots of teams are in between.
 |Personally, I think Sinofsky is really great a managing large projects and making sure they ship. I don't think he is a visionary leader and I don't think that he gets his employees to their highest possible potential.  Is he a viable alternative? No idea, time will tell I guess :)

It just works and works well with very little maintenance.  As for the Kernal itself, I've never done any hacking on the Kernal, but I appreciate everything that Linus has done :)
[At Microsoft you worked on Windows Server and on Azure. What led you to switch from those technologies that you were familiar with to the world of Linux. What dev stack are you using right now and how does it suit your business better than the alternatives that Microsoft has to offer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c655385?context=5)|Two reasons, cost and the open source community.  For BidKat, I used Ubuntu 12, nginx as the front end web server, node.js as the backend, with Redis.io for caching and mongoDB for my database.  Total cost of the stack is $0.
 |The open source community around node.js is pretty amazing which made development much easier.  Out of the 8k lines of code in BidKat, I only had to write about 3k of them.  Everything else was available in open source libraries that come with full test suites.  I took advantage of expressjs for serving the web site, connectors for Redis and mongoDB, mongoose for ORM, mustache for HTML templates, mocha for my test harness, and a bunch of other smaller libraries.
 |Developers that use Microsoft aren't as big into open source which means the community isn't as developed.  For my needs, Microsoft's stack would have simply cost me more and provided me less.  
[What cms did you use ? or was this all custom ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64wlhk?context=5)|BidKat is completely custom code, no CMS was harmed.

Microsoft has some of the smartest, most dedicated people that I've ever met.  They made going into work enjoyable even through the distractions of re-orgs, calibrations, and office politics.
[A PM who wrote code? I call shennigans.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c659rkm?context=5)|I know right?  I actually checked code into the production branch a few times to fix a couple of UI bugs.

I wish I could say it was all automated with unit tests, but that wouldn't be true.  We just use it a lot, log errors, and fix things as they come up.  Luckily we're not building things for the government or medical industries so the worse thing that happens is a user might see an error.

Basically we started with a bunch of wire frames and ideas of how we wanted it to work.  Once we had that done I built out the server component (the piece that actually saves the auctions, negotiates with buyers, and tracks offers). Once that was in good shape, I built out the actual web site page by page, slowly adding new functionality.

[How did you get the job at Microsoft and did you like working there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64zjv8?context=5)|That's an interesting story actually.  I was just finishing up my Master's thesis and had no real job prospects.  I turned down an offer from Motorola (wasn't interested in hardware design anymore) and was planning on starting my job search after my dissertation.  Out of the blue, I got a phone call from Microsoft asking if I would be interested in applying, even though I had never even sent in a resume or applied for a job.  A phone screening and interview later, I accepted a position.  I've never heard of anybody else getting hired like that, so I don't suggest it as a sound strategy :)
 |Like any big company, Microsoft has it's positives and negatives.  Overall, it was a really positive experience for me.  I learned a lot from a lot of really smart people and worked on some really interesting problems.  Regardless of what you might hear, there are definitely much, much worse places to work.
[I work in MS Licensing at a LAR, how did you feel about the nature of licensing server products such as Server/CALs? Do you feel that licensing and software development ever clash? Microsoft definitely has the most robust software licensing model out there, with numerous agreements, clauses and subclauses...sometimes it feels like licensing is only there to force revenue generation, would you agree?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64yong?context=5)|Licensing is definitely only there to force revenue generation :)  There were many times when I was on an engineering team that we were asked to cripple our products in weird ways to support some new licensing scheme (which they would then want to change 1 week before shipping). For my start-up, I use no Microsoft software at all because of all the crazy licensing.  I don't have the time, money, or knowledge to deal with that.
 |I think Microsoft will need to address this problem soon because they are quickly losing out on a whole new generation of software developers.  It will be a big problem is Microsoft loses their dominance in platforms. 
[For server side applications I think they are irrelevant, and it has been for awhile.  I get a headache of just thinking about their licensing options, that is no innovation.

This particular site requires lots of server side applications, quite a few of them are very innovative.  Server side applications are not just client side applications with licensing fees :)

I like the approach that they use where you actual play with the code and see the results.
 |People think lots of different things about Ballmer, I'm not sure myself if he's the best person to be heading Microsoft right now.  However, for people that have worked at Microsoft, the Vanity Fair article didn't ring very true.  They had a story they wanted to tell and they told it. 
[How difficult did economic regulation make starting your own business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64zpix?context=5)|I filled out an online form and sent the great state of Washington $150 and boom, we had a business.  Now hiring workers is a little trickier, but as a couple of co-founders starting an LLC we haven't had to tackle that problem yet.  So, as of right not, not difficult at all.
[Do you make enough money to pay at least the minimum wage in Washington or is that going to be a problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zikkv/iama_9_year_microsoft_veteran_that_left_last_year/c64zzmo?context=5)|We don't currently have any employees, just founders which aren't currently taking a salary (there is no requirement that founders make any money).  Luckily there was no expectation that we would be rolling in the dough 3 weeks after releasing our first service, so this isn't going to cause any problems.

If you interview for a developer role, then yes there will be programming and algorithms questions.  If you interview for a program manager role (works with dev and test to define requirements for products), there will be some high level programming (if the team is an engineering team) but it will be more focused on problem solving, your thought process, how you deal with ambiguity, and how you resolve conflict.

zjjod,9,2012-09-08,Questions about post-college job prospects as a CompSci major.,qaruxj,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/zjjod/questions_about_postcollege_job_prospects_as_a/,"**tl;dr:** Are the claims of a massive shortage of CompSci majors true, and if so are the available jobs going to be mostly good or mostly bad? Finally, will the salaries still be as good, or will they somehow decrease and become more comparable with other STEM degrees?

I've seen a few articles talking about how there's going to be some huge shortage of Computer Science majors in the US come 2016 (which is about the time I'll be graduating), which obviously seems like good news insofar as it means I should definitely have a job. However, I have a couple of questions about that.

First, as context, I'm taking on *a lot* of debt to go to college. My family is quite poor and so I'm basically taking the maximum amount of loans I can get, since my university doesn't like to give scholarships to freshmen. Later, I expect this to subside since I'll be getting a job, hopefully scholarships, and will also be required to do a couple of paid internships my senior year that will pay $40,000, which obviously should help me out quite a lot, but I'm nonetheless worried about the prospect of having tens of thousands in loans, much of them accumulating debt over the 4+ years (my department says that, due to their internships, the average graduation time is actually four years and a term, and since I'm not some kind of crazy amazing student, I expect that I will probably do at least that).

Right now, I'm really excited for CompSci, but I know that a lot of people do change their majors and end up pursuing something completely different from what they started out with. I really don't think I could bring myself to major in something like English or History, having seen what's happening to all these people who've graduated with way better and more specific degrees and still failed to find a job, but I want to know how accurate these shortage claims are. Employment opportunities are not my only concern, because I do want to major in something that interests me, but when I see these claims that other Engineering degrees aren't experiencing much of a shortage while Computer Science majors are looking at crazy opportunities in four years' time, it really makes me want to stick with CompSci at all costs, just so I know I can have a good job that pays decent money.

Getting to actual questions:

First, are these claims even true at face value? I've seen a number of articles claiming flat out that this is a myth and that demand for CompSci majors is being greatly overstated. Some of them seemed rather dubious to me, but I feel like that might just be me being biased after having heard about there being a shortage of millions of CompSci majors and demand so high that salaries will be ridiculously good compared to the national average, which obviously sounds really appealing and too good to be true, but also would be so beneficial to me in terms of job opportunities and salary that it's hard for me to really weigh it equally.

Related to that, are there any ""gotchas"" that could turn this from true to not true really quickly? I read one article saying the response to the shortage should be decreased immigration restrictions, but I don't know to what extent that would change things. Is there anything with a reasonable chance of happening (so not an asteroid strike or WWIII) that would drastically alter my job prospects that I should be aware of?

Second, what are these jobs actually going to be like? I'm really interested in software engineering/development and databases, but I'm kind of worried that most of these jobs will be glorified IT jobs or something that won't really be what I'm interested in. I'm assuming the huge glut of jobs would have enough diversity that it wouldn't be a problem, but if it's a million small business owners who want me to set up their network for them and build a custom Access database to track their orders in, I'm probably not going to be very happy.

Third, I know software engineer salaries are really good right now, but is this expected to stay the same? I assume the increased demand would mean higher salaries all around, but if it's the small businesses I mentioned or something like that, I could see them going down because they're mostly intended to replace whatever the owner or their kid threw together and not increased demand in the same way that every major company needing a lot more software developers would be. I guess this is a largely irrational concern, but the reason I bring it up is, if I would end up making a similar salary to any of the other jobs that might interest me, I would not be quite as attached to CompSci as I am now.

Thanks for any help with this."

I'm a 20F involved with a 26M; it's still pretty new, been together about a month.

Here is the context of this relationship: I interned at the company he works for (a very big company-- however, within a tight-knit industry) this summer. I'm no longer employed there, but hope to return; he works in an entirely different department than I did and holds a senior, but non-management position (emphatically: he was not my boss and wouldn't be if I returned). 

We struck up a relationship at the end of my internship and kept it quiet. My internship is now over, we continue to keep it quiet. 

I never flirted or entertained advances from anyone else at this company, and starting talking to him in a 'romantic' way only after getting to know him.

I really care about him, and the feelings are reciprocated. He's probably the best guy I've ever met, and I want to see where this goes. 

However, clouded as my judgment is -- is this a good idea, given the workplace connection we have, and particularly my position as a (now former) intern?

TL;DR: I got involved with a ""real employee"" who worked in a different department than mine while on an internship. Now that the internship's over, is it appropriate if I date him? I'm looking for outside input here. 

So, specific question: Is this relationship appropriate?"

Here's the backstory. First of all, I just got out of a 5 year relationship this past January. Haven't ever dated. I did an out of state internship this summer where all the students in the program lived in on-campus housing together. I became incredibly close with my group of friends in the program. I was really into one of the guys in my group of friends since I first met him. We have tons of things in common. During one of our first weekends over there, we went to a party. After a few drinks he tells me that my boyfriend is a lucky guy and I respond that I'm single. Pretty big hint, I'm motivated. Nothing afterword.

Halfway through the program, after a night out, I ""left"" some of my things at his apartment. We go back and it's just us. We play some soul calibur and then I get ready to go. I hug him and tell him I really like him, he says he likes me too. Nothing happens afterword beside friend stuff.

 2/3 the way through the program I decided to hell with it. Walking home from work together, before we part way, I grab his hand and tell him I want to be more than friends with him for the remainder of our program, he says yes. We end up having sex for the rest of the summer. I'd sleep over often and our last night he stayed up all night with me til my 6:00a flight talking about our childhoods.

So I was never sure how he felt about me. Because I initiated the relationship we had and he was never really vocal about his feelings, sometimes I felt like he just went along with me. 

**Would the typical guy sleep with an out-of-state friend in this situation to avoid saying no?**

I'll see him this winter, plus at other conferences, graduate school etc. I don't want to keep sleeping with him if he wasn't big on the idea in the first place. "

**Here's the deal**: (I'm trying to be extra thorough in case anyone has any legitimate advice) -- My partner/boyfriend and I are in our late 20s, and living together. He graduated law school in May of 2011, tried very hard (tons of interviews, taking lots of attorneys out to coffee, networking events, etc) for 8 months, to no avail. At his wit's end, he borrowed $8,000 from his mother to set up his own firm (tapping out all potential assistance from his parents). He set up the firm, got an office, and it was great, except for the whole finding clients part... he was doing low-income referrals... but even those are not plentiful enough to pay the bills... That endeavor is failing, and he'll probably be closing out the lease on his office soon and trying to get a regular old grocery store/bar job (though the market is terrible and even that could be a struggle for several months). His credit card has been maxed out for a long time. He has $200,000+ in student loan debt. 

I graduated law school in May of this year, with $60,000 in student loan debt, which I don't have to start paying back until November. My credit card (relatively low limit, cant get more due to shitty credit) is maxed out as well. I've been applying to 5+ jobs per day - all over the board- since June, when my last internship ended (takes a long time if I write thorough cover letters), and have been consistently rejected. Only 1 phone interview and 1 in-person interview so far. 

I have been babysitting/nannying occasionally at $12/hr - whenever I can find gigs - and it's proving to not be enough. We have $200/month in food stamps, and a full pantry. 

**Today**: We sucked up the courage to look at our checking account balances, knowing they're getting low. I have $53 dollars left. He has $310 dollars left. Our automatically billed ""bare bones"" expenses - electric, gas, insurance- total more than that easily. We've cancelled our netflix, gym memberships, and extra ""non-essentials"". 

OH GOD WHAT DO I DO NEXT. (*breathes into paper bag*)

1) Should I be open to applying for internship positions even though I won't be returning to school? If so, how do I show employers that I am open to both a full time OR an internship?

2) I am applying to every firm that hires actuaries in Missouri. Given my attached resume, what do you honestly think of my chances? I'd like to say that my communication/interviewing skills are pretty decent. 

3) What do you think of my resume? Critiques are welcome!

zmidy,2,2012-09-09,Can I get your opinion on a situation??,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zmidy/can_i_get_your_opinion_on_a_situation/,"**tl:dr** met a girl online almost a year ago and still haven't seen her, though I am absolutely head over heels crazy about her. Catch she is 4000 miles away.

**edit:** Knew I forgot to add something, I am a hundred percent sure she is not a guy, she is a girl.

**edit2:** I hope ye realize I have all of these doubts and fears too, hence I posted this. I think I'll email her a link and just see what happens.

**edit3:** So I emailed her about how much it scares me that all ye are saying is true, I included a link to this. Thank you all for your comments, I honestly don't know what is going to happen. I trust this girl, for feck sake I'm head over heals in love with her.

Ok so we met on omegle last November, I was up messing with people when I met her. I had one of the greatest talks of my life, I swear I fell in love that night (I actually still have the transcript). Well we exchanged emails and we started chatting, early on it was clear we had chemistry we click on almost everything likes and dislikes. Seriously I can't find a single fault with this girl. So after a month or so I ask if I have a chance with her, because if we had continued as we were I would have been heartbroken if I fell further for her and she didn't feel the same. Success she felt the same way. Okay, so far we have been talking through email for hours almost every day, we both like each other and we both know it and we still have not seen each other. More time passes I fall for her even more, we're talking a little less due to the work and time difference. 

So one thing ye need to know, I haven't pushed the pic issue at all, she doesn't have Facebook due to work and she never had use for Skype. Email is working fine so I'm not pushing it as I want her comfortable with sharing this. She also doesn't have the best laptop so it doesn't have a cam and she doesn't own one. 

We reach March and it's her birthday, so I give her a voucher for amazon to buy a webcam and some pirate stuff. Well amazon fuck up and freeze her account, it's now September and she is still waiting for her stuff. So circumstances are still screwing me over but I'm happy and I'm not going to push this. So we continue as is.

I think I should just make something clear at this point. I want to marry this girl, that's how crazy I am about her. And I don't give a rats ass what she looks like, fat, ugly or drop dead gorgeous I want this girl forever. 

Back to the story, Summer is approaching and she gets an internship program which will really advance her career. Downside she will be in dorms and moving around the country for 3 months. So the Summer sucks, but I persevere. We get to email a bit but not a lot and I miss her like you wouldn't believe.
Well she has been back home for about 2 weeks, due to moving and work we have both being incredibly busy with barely anytime to email each other.

So we had discussed me visiting over Halloween, and before ye say anything I won't be going without seeing her first.
The point is I will have to book stuff soon, she has said she will get me a pic once she has the time. I guess I'm just loosing it and need to vent and want some different perspectives on the whole situation.  I'm in Love with this girl and I haven't seen her face, and it's just starting to get to me a little. 

So I'ld love to hear what ye all think, feel free to ask about anything."
zmewu,4,2012-09-09,The reasons why I'm depressed.,smibly,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/zmewu/the_reasons_why_im_depressed/,"For some people their depression is only an emotional state and when they're not depressed things start to go great.  It's not the case for me.  Even the rare moments when I am feeling good and confident reality quickly knocks me back down.

First of all I'm stupid in the real world and fail at everything I do.  I can repeat tutorials in things and do basic academic exercises but anything that requires cleverness or creativity on my part is always beyond my reach.  I always get it bad or do it wrong.  That is why I fail at everything I do.  In terms of results I'm pretty much no better than a drone or a mindless machine.  I even fail at the mindless, mechanically repeated tasks when under pressure.  Doing things in the real world means doing them under pressure and in unpredictable situations.

I also don't have any friends or social life and never have since I was a little kid, I was always the worst loser in school, even among the loser crowds.  Eventually I didn't even get bullied anymore because I wasn't good enough as a target.  People don't like or respect me.  I also never got invited to anything, even by people who I thought were friends when I was really just someone who tagged along and they didn't really notice.

I also don't get any girls and have never had a girlfriend at age 24.  Women show no interest or attraction to me.  If I couldn't get a girlfriend in college then there really is no hope for me, it doesn't get any easier than in college.  It's like their instincts automatically say no to me and yes to other guys.

When I talk to people I'm never respected.  Assholes ignore me, put me down or just push me out of any interaction.  Nice people talk to me like I'm a little boy.  It's like I radiate weakness no matter what I do.  Projecting my voice and fixing my posture has no effect.  When I do speak what I say has no effect, even when my position hasn't been established at the bottom yet.

My face and body play a role in all of this too.  I'm short, weak, lacking in masculine physical features, have weak facial features and a little boy's face, a bit ugly, and now balding.  These things that I lack all very important to getting people to think well of you, get girls, and for success at work.

Right now I'm also unemployed and shamefully enough living in my parents' house after graduating from college with an engineering degree after repeating a ridiculous number of classes.  No one wants to hire me for anything, I never even got an internship in school and can't even get a job stocking grocery shelves and can't pay my student debt.  I had a really hard time getting any job before the recession hit but now it's just out of my reach.  Even if I did get one I would probably continue to be the guy at the bottom of the pecking order who gets bullied and picked on, never mind promotions.

There's more but I can't keep it all in my head at once."
zmcqc,2,2012-09-09,I am going out my mind over the possibility of getting a B in a one credit class in my freshman year. I know it's silly but I can't stop panicking.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/zmcqc/i_am_going_out_my_mind_over_the_possibility_of/,"So, there was this assignment on blackboard that I had really wanted to turn in at least a week early but I couldn't find the time. I was only able to do it two days before the actual class. I thought the assignment was due before the class but it turns out that he expects assignments to be turned in three days before a class and he had put this on an announcement on blackboard that I skimmed over. So, this assignment is late and will receive a zero.

This means the highest grade I can get is a B. I am freaking out. I had plan to try to get all A's in my two years in community college so it would be extremely easy for me to transfer. I know that the difference between 3.9 and 4.0 is negligible especially if I get involved in EC's, get a job and/or internships, get research experience and all that but I was so set on trying to be perfect. Plus, I'm kind of embarrassed since it was a required ""college readiness"" class and it should have been an easy A. I lost track of it due to studying for Calculus and Biology that I let it slip by.

I know I'm being ridiculous but I was so focused on being perfect and I'm so bent out of shape on having that taken away my first semester. I am considering dropping the class and taking it again but I don't think I have the money to pay for it again..."

What were your most favorite and least favorite jobs?",Journeyman42,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zm9q5/reddit_what_is_your_job_history_what_were_your/,"I started a new job a couple weeks ago, and it made me realize how many jobs I've had.  I'm a 26 year old guy.

February 2001-August 2004: high school part-time job as a bus boy at a restaurant.  It wasn't too bad, but my boss left halfway through and her replacement didn't like me and stuck me on coffee detail, which I didn't mind because customers suck.  Left because I was starting college.

October 2004-May 2006:  part-time job at college campus food court.  Included work at Burger King, a taco place, and a panini place.  Left because serving food to high/hungover college students sucks.

Summers of 2005-2010: full-time seasonal cleaning assistant during the summer at first an elementary school for the first four years, then at a high school for the last year.  It wasn't too bad of a job, I didn't have to deal with customers and I could wear headphones while I cleaned.  Also the other janitors were laid back dudes who took hour breaks while only clocking out for a half hour.  Yeah, our tax dollars at work lol.  It wasn't bad money either.  Elementary and high school kids are equally messy, but the high school kids are definitely far more malicious about it.  I saw some little bastards throw their soda bottle at the feet of one of the other janitors and demanded that he throw it away.

September 2006-December 2006: part-time job as a cleaning person at a hotel.  Don't ask why I got it.  I sucked pretty hard at it as they needed the rooms perfectly cleaned in too little time, which I couldn't manage.  Left because job sucked and I sucked at it, and I found a better job.

February 2007-December 2008: part-time geology lab tutor at the university I went to.  I found out that geology minors can also be lab tutors, and they had need for one, so I did that until I graduated.  It was pretty good other than the students bitching about why they needed to take earth science classes (the school has a pretty big business and nursing colleges).  After I graduated, the economy had pretty much bottomed out and I didn't find work (aside from that seasonal cleaning assistant job I mentioned earlier) until fall 2009, when I was living with my parents and spending too much time on the internet.

September 2009-May 2010: Substitute teacher at the middle and high school level.  Found out that the only requirements you need to become a substitute teacher in my state are any 4-year degree and a clean criminal record, and I had both.  High school kids suck.

December 2010-January 2011: I wasn't getting asked enough to substitute teach so I took a job at a restaurant as a waiter.  The restaurant had just opened and the guy that owned it, who owned a bar previously, picked a really shitty manager to run it.  It was supposed to be a part-time job but increasingly worked more hours because other servers would call in ""sick"" or just not fucking show up.  Kitchen was too small to keep up with orders when the restaurant was food so I got a lot of complaints from people bitching about their food taking too long.  Eventually fired on a day I literally wasn't supposed to be there (I was covering for someone who asked to take the day off and I accepted) because of some customer's bullshit claim.  This was the shift after a particularly brutal steak night and, after I clocked out, the owner bought me a beer at the bar to thank me for working so hard.  Customers still suck.  One of two jobs that I would say were my least favorite.

It was during my time at the restaurant that I realized I should probably go back to school, because my 4 year degree wasn't helping with shit.  I eventually picked a 2 year degree in a biotechnology lab technician program at a tech school in the nearest big city from home.  After I got fired, I realized that I could apply to substitute in multiple school districts, and eventually was working at least two days a week (it paid about 100 dollars a day, depending on what the district paid).

September 2010-December 2011: Tutor at tech school.  I was randomly walking down the hallway near the library when I saw an ad for gen ed tutors.  I was virtually hired on the spot due to my geo lab tutoring.  I tutored mainly for chemistry, biology, and earth science because all the other tutors specialized in either math or English, though I did have to help with English and math sometimes.  Was a pretty sweet gig at first, I tutored at night and the last hour of the day was pretty much dead, so I could do my own homework or dick around on the computers, waiting for people to show up.  However, the next two semesters I switched to tutoring mornings and it was busier.  Left because there's only so many times you have to explain what a meter is or what chemical bonds are before you snap.

May 2011-May 2012: part-time research assistant to a PhD student internship at UW-Madison.  My first lab tech job.  I got it by asking one of my profs at the tech school (who did research at UW) if she knew of any open positions, and they created one for me.  PhD student researches iron-reducing bacteria that live in anaerobic conditions in sediment or rock.  I had to perform a lot of chemical assays, chromatography, and some molecular biology to sequence ID the bacteria in the samples.  Easily my most favorite job yet.  I had to leave after I graduated because it was a student-only position.

January 2012-May 2012: part-time lab tech internship at a bioenergy company.  Though it was more chemcial-oriented than biotech-oriented, it was a good time.  Would be instrumental later.

May 2012-July 2012: full-time (finally!) ""lab tech"" position at a huge contract research biotech/chemistry company.  Got the job through a recruiter who upsold the fuck out of it by saying I could transfer to a new department pretty much any time I wanted to.  The company was starting a new contract project that included refabbing existing build space and would last for six-ish months.  However, when I started working, I realized my error.  The specific department was sample prep for food chemistry, which involved putting cereal and other food into blenders and then dumping liquid nitrogen on them to send to the actual chemists.  I also did sample pitching, which was going through all the boxes of archived samples and then pitching (ie, throwing away) the expired samples.  I had to work near the trash compactor, which, due to the 100+ degree weather we had this summer, stunk the entire area to high hell.  I was let go because they overestimated the amount of people they needed for the project and apparently the other person was more of the drone-type they were looking for.  I was miserable there and was actually happy to be fired.

The job hunt after I was fired, however, wasn't too bad.  Like I said, I got a job a couple weeks ago at a startup that researches battery electrolytes, and it pays much better than the food chemistry place did.  And no garbage smell.  I'm also taking a night class this next year in Stem Cell Technologies, so hopefully that pans out after I get my certificate and I can finally get a stable full-time job."
zm9cg,1,2012-09-09,"I [23M] am 'stuck' in a relationship with SO [22F]. Utterly confusing and stressful situation, help me.",IAMATrappedThrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zm9cg/i_23m_am_stuck_in_a_relationship_with_so_22f/,"Okay, I have been in a relationship with a girl for almost 2 years now and we have been living together for about a year and a half. 

The beginning of our relationship was amazing, with some rocky parts (but what relationship doesn't have these?). However, since she first moved in with me she had conflict with my best-friend/roommate and my other roommate and essentially seperated me from them and a few other of my friends who she has had arguments or fights with. She is loving and cares about me for the most part but she can easily turn into a monster, especially after drinking. 

I work full-time at a hospital after having graduated last year, while she is a senior in college, works part time, and does an internship so she has little in the ways of income which results in me buying literally every meal/drink for her for the most part; she also pays about a 1/3rd of what I pay for rent (we currently share a 2BR apartment with another couple). 

For about a year my friends have said this or that about how I deserve better than her and how she's an awful person... during this time I have had to walk a very thin line to please both parties and try to compromise things between them.

Sex has literally dwindled to nothing as since the beginning of our relationship she has always had pain during intercourse and it almost turns me off that she gets basically no satisfaction (just the opposite) out of it. This isn't a huge problem, but it's obviously an issue of frustration.

There are many times I tell myself that I continue the relationship strictly because I am too lonely and would rather suffer these problems with her rather than suffer alone... I hate an empty bed.

Now this is where things get a little more complicated, an extremely attractive girl [20F] came into my hospital the other day... While she waited around we exchanged glances across the room the entire time... I left without saying a word to her, but I don't know what it was... but I went home and went on craigslist and made a missed connection regarding her. Now I honestly didn't expect anything to come of it but lo and behold, the next day I look at my emails and she replied, saying ""I hope I had caught your glance!"" I was floored to say the least.

Now this is where my stress starts... she asked for my number and we have been texting back and forth... hasn't asked me if I'm in a relationship and wants to get together for coffee or a meal and now I feel uneasy and almost ashamed that I am either A) emotionally cheating on my girlfriend, or B) leading this other girl on. 

The situation wouldn't be so hard for me if I didn't just get around to moving into a new apartment with my girlfriend the beginning of this month. She is not on the lease, but I don't think I can afford the extra $300 with her not there, nor do I think I would have the heart to tell my girlfriend to find a place on her own with absolutely no money or other options as far as her continuing her education/internship/job out here. I truly feel stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no idea what to do, I haven't told anyone else and it's literally eating me up.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I am desperate for help.

**TL;DR: I am stuck/living with my girlfriend and have been approached and been talking to another girl**"

",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/zm0px/here_goes_nothing_sorry_this_is_long_its_years_of/,"I feel pathetic posting this on a public forum.  I guess I'm just looking for someone who would have some kind of reason or even can relate to what I've been going through almost my entire life.

I can remember my first thought of suicide at the age of 6.  I wanted to run out into the middle of the street and hoped to get hit by a passing car.  I remember where I was standing in front of my house, looking around to see if anyone saw me, and, then, I started running towards the street; but, I stopped.  My thoughts were, ""What if I don't succeed?  Then I'm going to get the worst beating of my life and still have to suffer through all of this."" 

It's almost 20 years later, and that has been my biggest fear ever since.  I do not want to get others involved, and I do not want to fail.  

At the age of 13, I started cutting myself, and I have been struggling with this off and on throughout the years.  I kept it a really hidden secret for two years until I confided in a close friend about my cutting and about a beating I had received from my father.  That friend then called the cops, and they came over to my house.  I told them that my father didn't beat me because I didn't want to see him go to jail; they took pictures of my scars from cutting and threatened to take me away if I did it again.  After the cops left, I kept getting yelled at for being a stupid, ignorant bitch for getting my father in trouble like that and for doing those things to my body.  I can understand this view of things.  I really can, but the cutting, for me, is almost like an addiction.  It has been my only friend during my depression and sadness.  The release is almost euphoric.  And, just the thought of how wonderful harming myself feels, gets me excited for the release that I could feel from the pain of suicide.

I have been planning my suicide for a very long time now.  I've had the gun to my head; I've had the rope around my neck.  I just haven't gone through with it because attempting suicide is like a gamble.  I do not want someone that I love to have to clean up a mess.  I do not want to have to see my mutilated corpse.  I don't want them to be the first to find me.  I wish there was just a place that could assure me that I will die and that the people that I love will not be able to view any part of it.  

I'm very confident in my choice to commit suicide.  I know that I will do it one day.  I just need to find the perfect way to do it.  

Lately, I have been thinking more heavily about it.  The only times that I don't think about suicide is when I feel like I have purpose in life and when someone is relying on me.  How pathetic, huh?  I see no point in having a life that imposes such burdens and frustration on others.  

I'm a complete failure.  I had my first professional internship in the engineering field before I even graduated high school.  I was accepted to some of the most prestigious colleges in the states.  I had a wonderful plan to marry my now ex-fiance (of 5.5 years) and have a family with him.  But, now, I was denied the ability to go to these colleges because my parents did not want me so far away.  And, even after going to a local college, I couldn't finish school due to finances.  That wonderful ex cheated on me with 5 girls in the time we were together and stole my virginity.  I can't even walk into my church for help in fear of getting excommunicated because I had sex with my ex.  My life is a complete waste now.  And, I would really like to be able to find a way to end it as soon as I can. 

Has anyone else felt this way for so long?  Do you know why?  Did you ever get over it?  How?

I work on multiple different products. Basically, every new product our company comes out with, I am responsible for a feature or two. The majority of my work though, is maintaining, updating, + testing our internal tools for software development ( we have our own language, own server architecture, and our own IDE.

Other than that, I would say about 40-50% of my remaining time I spend programming internal data reports ( work a little bit with R and integrate it into our own language) and also programming electronic forms.
So far, I've been at this company for about a year, but I definitely think that I can stay for the long haul if I'd like to.

As I'm taking more Comp Sci classes, I'm noticing some people are completing multiple short internships with big(ger) name companies (bigger than the company I work for). So, this is my question:

**To Potential Employers, would multiple internships(say, 4-6 months each) at mid to large size companies look more attractive than one job (focused on programming in JavasScript, Python, and some c#) that I stayed at for 5 years?**

Some people are advising me that It may look better for me to have 5 years experience on my resume than 2 or 3 five month internships. The only reason I've been questioning.that is because the company is not, you know, a huge company (it's not considered the number one tech place to work in my area or anything)


One of my other concerns, regarding internships, was the work they do. Most of my friends complain about how the work they do at their internships is quite **menial and boring**...(Sort of makes sense, too. Interns at my current company get all the busy/boring work as well).
Looking at it from the HR perspective, would my title be more respected than the title of intern?

Currently, my title is Junior Programmer and I feel that HR departments will consider that a notch or two higher than the title of intern...One of the HR guys I've talked to advised me to stay at my current job(especially since I think I have good chances of being promoted in in the next 4 years while I'm in college) because it would make my salary for my next job a bit higher than it would be for the average student who completed a few interns. Not that I necessarily agree with all this HR crap, but the more I think about it and the more people I meet, this seems to be increasingly true.


**TLDR: What looks more attractive on a resume: multiple short internships or one position held for 5 years?**

Note: I'm also fairly positive that I have room to grow(position-wise) at my current company."

zlf6g,0,2012-09-09,Half-Asian 25m having difficulties getting over father issues.  Biological father appeared back in my life after 2 decades and wants me to help him.,asterysk,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/zlf6g/halfasian_25m_having_difficulties_getting_over/,"Hi /relationships, wondering if you might have some advice for me.  My father left me when I was very young and I'm still having trouble getting over his absence.  Also it's complicated by the fact that he is from a foreign country, which has caused... racial identity issues for me as well.

Background, I'll try to condense this as much as possible:

- American mother (white) travelled overseas to work as an English teacher in...lets say, China.  (Close enough.)

- Met my soon-to-be father (Asian) who was relatively well off at the time.  Had a 3yo daughter from a previous marriage, son of an affluent, well-respected doctor in his town.  

- Decided they wanted to get married, moved back to US, mom's family **freaked**.  Maternal grandmother and aunt on my mother's side gradually turned mother against him, started trying to indoctrinate and kidnap my older half-sister.  Temporarily cut off contact between father and my older sis esp as he was working long hours trying to make a paycheck...difficult for a foreigner with no degree.

- During this time I was born.

- 2 weeks later situation was so bad, dad decided to ""cut his losses"" and take his older daughter back to China.

**TL;DR - Mom brought home a ""foreigner"", her family freaked out, dad left 2 weeks after I was born.**

**Childhood:**

- Mother remarried when I was three, mother and stepfather had a daughter when I was six.  Growing up, my sister and I fought a lot, I wasn't too close to my stepfather, but these have both improved over time.  I'm on good terms with mom, stepfather, and younger sister today.  (The four of us are essentially ""the family"".  I call my stepfather ""dad"" nowadays.)

- Predominantly white (&gt;90%) public school in a socially conservative small town in the deep south was difficult for me.  I was strong academically but had difficulty making friends from middle school onwards.  I always felt ""different"" and that I didn't belong because I was Asian (compared to everyone else I might as well have been 100% Asian, they couldn't tell any difference).  Was not as well off as everyone else.  Wealth equated to social status in the town I grew up in.  I used my mom's last name but even that was weird.  European name, but not common.  I was teased a lot for being: 1. Asian. 2. Poor.  3. Weird last name. 4. Nerdy, overly concerned about studies.  One the one hand, everyone identified me as **the Asian kid**, yet on the other hand I didn't know much beyond just a little bit from what my mother had told me about China, what I read in news/books, a few words.

- Mom and stepfather divorced when I started high school.  Turned out to be not as traumatizing, both my younger sis and I have gotten over it decently.

- I basically hated living in Small Town, had only a few friends (but I still keep up with them loosely today).  I doubled down on my studies knowing I was at least intelligent and could go to college and GTFO of Small Town.  

- Looking back at high school it's actually painfully obvious to me now that I had several good opportunities to have a relationship with girls in school.  I guess I always second-guessed myself thinking that I was too poor (and didn't want them to know) and that no one would be legitimately interested in me because I was this nerdy Asian kid.  I felt also that I didn't really know how to talk to them and reciprocate as it was something a ""dad"" was supposed to teach, and my stepfather and I weren't too close growing up.  I was too nervous to ever make a move and ask them out, even though it's obvious now they *were* interested.

- Mom and sis moved to a different state when I was a senior in high school.  Stayed with my stepdad to finish HS, he was cool.  Family pressured me to go to school in the new state, and I wanted to get as far away as possible so I went ahead.  

**TL;DR - I was a nerdy half-Asian kid growing up, no connection to Asian side of family.  Difficulty with social interactions in general.  No biological dad to talk to which bothered me frequently to the point of crying.**

**College:**

- I basically took a ton of courses and double-engineering-majored which basically killed social life beyond classmates I did projects with.  During college (and even today, still) I had difficulty with social interactions in general.  I didn't really know what I wanted to do (doctor, optometrist, work in private industry, grad school?) so I basically hunkered down hoping that something good would come.  I was also concerned about not getting a job out of college in this economy, so I tried my best in school.  (Have a good job now, at least.)

- Sometimes I would still wake up in the middle of the night freaking out about not knowing my biological father.  Spoke with several counselors in college trying to get over issues with father's absence but nothing really helped.  Still had difficulties with friendships and relationships.

- 3rd year of college, Christmas break, this girl Facebook PM's me out of the blue claiming to be the daughter of my father's best friend (lets call him Bob).  **Verified legit.**  Turns out in the last 21 years my biological father has amounted to basically nothing.  His father kept bugging him to find me, he ignored.  Tried to forget about his first son completely with a third marriage.  3rd wife conned the entire family out of nearly all of their savings.  Works as a cab driver now, and wastes whatever he does manage to save gambling in commodities markets (like stocks, basically).  I worked at an internship the following summer so *I* could pay for a plane ticket to see him the *next* Christmas break.  

- I've seen my dad twice now in China, and once when he visited for my college graduation in the US.  Roughly a total of a 3-4 month period.  He says he's proud of me, but it seems superficial.  He and Bob want me to put my financial ass on the line and sponsor him to obtain a work visa so he can work all the way across the country, in CA (I'm in northern US).  My dad has basically spent the last 2+ decades turing to waste what was once a pretty damn good living situation.  He's irresponsible, is a stimpleton that I really can't relate to, has poor manners, **essentially abandoned me**, and now wants me to lift him out of his shitty situation that he is 100% responsible for.  

**TL;DR I busted my ass from before I walked into grade school until I stepped out of college with a diploma so that I would have a better life than I grew up with.  BioDad basically erased me from his memory, turned his life into a shit hole, appears out of thin air, and now wants a successful son he's suddenly discovered to put his ass on the line for him**

**So, questions:**

1.  What can I do to get my self past having ""father"" issues, and this feeling that I don't belong... that I'm a foreigner in my own country?  I've tried just ignoring it when growing up, but it seems to come back repeatedly, contaminating my confidence in work, social interactions, relationships, and sense of self-worth.  Should I just try to man up, ignore that this ever happened, and get over it? (Hasn't worked for the last 2 decades.)  Or, is there something else I can do?
2.  Should I try extending a hand this stranger, or tell him to F-off and solve his own problems that he brought upon himself?

Thanks you guys!  End of rant.  I won't likely get around to checking back on this post until Sunday evening after work."

We only dated for about 8 months, however in short he began feeling some mixture of tired/trapped (not exactly what he said, but basically) in our relationship because it was the longest he's ever been in one. He said he wanted to take a break in order to figure out what he's feeling. 

Prior to the decision to take a break he stopped touching me (hand holding, hugging me, kissing me goodnight, etc). At first I figured he was just stressed out from being an intern, however then he started hanging out with a girl whom, before he began dating me, had a small crush on and with whom he had gone on a semi-date. (Note: at the beginning of the relationship I was unaware that he had gone on a ""semi-date"" with her. He told me it was not a date. I found this, and the fact that he still has some feelings for her, out when we decided to have a break). 

When I started feeling paranoid about the girl, whom he has previously excommunicated because he had feelings for her but was dating me, and him hanging out, he became defensive and told me I had trust issues. When we decided to take a break, I told him he could see other women, except for the one girl, during this time and think about our relationship. He told me he still wanted to hang around me, but that if I find any men attractive I should feel free to do the same. 

One of my friends (male) told me that when a male wants to take a break he either does not have the balls to break up with a girl outright or wants to break up with the girl but is afraid he won't find another girl. Before we dated, my ex-boyfriend was my best friend. He still says he loves me ""so much"", however he's just ""fucked up in the head"". Having heard this advice, I called him and asked if he really did just want to break up but didn't want to hurt me. He replied that he couldn't see us not being together. 

After taking a couple days on my own, I went over and hung out with our mutual group of friends and him. It eventually boiled down to just me and him hanging out. During this time he made a comment about ""If we start dating again..."". Furthermore, while I was hanging out with him it felt fine and natural, but once I left I began dwelling on the fact that he said ""if"". Many of my friends think that he's a bad guy for doing this to me, however he's probably one of the nicest guys I know. I guess what I want to know from you, Reddit, is am I being stupid for trying to be friends with him in hopes that 1 month from now we'll be back together? Or advice in general about my situation.

**tl;dr** My ex-boyfriend and I are on a break. He wants to be friends still and wants to re-evaluate in 1 month. Am I stupid for doing this?"

zl8y3,0,2012-09-09,Why do internship programs require you to be currently enrolled as a student? I just graduated. How the hell am I supposed to get experience now?,FoxhoundInc,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zl8y3/why_do_internship_programs_require_you_to_be/,"After many, many weeks of job and internship searching (you know the spiel: entry-level jobs, despite being, well, entry-level, require 2-3 years of relevant experience, and one obtains such experience through unpaid work as an intern) I've come to realize that organizations and agencies everywhere have the ""must be currently enrolled as an undergraduate or Master's student"" as a requirement.

So...why is this? I just graduated a couple months ago, and apparently that accomplishment that I should be so very proud of has made me ineligible for the exclusive and valuable practical experience needed to land a job in my dream career field.

Not to sound bitter, but, well, I am bitter. I want to work for federal law enforcement, and while there are a multitude of agencies to pick from, and most of them offer their own rendition of the ""career pathway""/""student internship""-type experience, which I would LOVE to be a part of, I am ineligible. Well, how am I supposed to get my foot in the door now? I've been hounding usajobs.gov for months now and I really don't think these agencies offer entry-level jobs. Internships are probably the gateway to being offered full-time positions. But by graduating I feel like I just shot myself in the foot because I closed off so many opportunities.

I suppose I could always start work towards a Master's program, but it seems a bit silly to put thousands more toward another degree while I am still dealing with the crippling amount of debt I'm shouldering at the moment, all for the chance of an unpaid internship.

Can anyone shed some light on this? Thanks in advance. And thanks for letting me vent a little."

Well I don't want to bother people to much but am just getting this off of my chest and looking for some kind of shared connection since I will never talk to people I know about this.

I over think things a lot and have just ended my longest relationship to date (2 years)

I know it is not long at all but I seem to be really bad at keeping girls around. I will give a quick background on everything and what situation I am in now.

I am a 23yo male and only started having relationships since I was 18.

 I had slept with a girl right after grad(first time and while I was a bit large). It went bad since I had no idea what to do and it just turned into a one night stand essentially. Three months later her friend told me she was pregnant and I began freaking out. This led on for another few months before I found out it was a joke (ha...ha...ha.......) So this made me take a step back from women for a while and focus on myself and losing weight. I lost a lot of weight quickly and gained a lot of self confidence that I lacked before. About 6 months later I met an older girl (22) then me (18) and she pursued me. I had no idea what was going on really and just ran with it. It was nice and a learned a lot about sex but nothing really matured me emotionally regarding relationships.

During this time I had met a girl at my summer job and couldn't believe how much I liked her. I ended it with the 22yo girl I was seeing for a few months and told her that I liked this other girl. I really pursued this girl from work who was 2 years younger then me and still in highschool (going Gr12) I felt something intense for her and never wanted anything so badly. I scared her off in the beggining and after 5 months of back and forth I finally asked her out and she said yes.

This was the most emotionally intense relationship I have ever had. Looking back I don't think it was real, and more of a build up of wanting her so bad and finally getting her after so much work and obsession. She was the first girl I ""loved""(Not sure anymore) and it only lasted 4 months. These were not great months and I was always getting hurt and struggling to keep her. She ended up breaking it off before grad due to many reasons, but the main one being her growing feelings for her friend. She ended it and ended up with this other guy who she is still with (but not happy)

This destroyed me. I did some really bad things for a few weeks. Contemplated suicide, listened to sad music all the time, cried a LOT, played it out in my head, harassed friends by asking about it all the time and complaining about it, etc. I started my summer job up again with her there again which made us argue a lot when working together, and make me even worse seeing her all the time.

Only a few weeks into the summer job I met a gorgeous and very happy girl who worked on contract at the facility. Being lonely and sad, I went for a rebound. I was in no emotional state to get connected again, so it just turned into sex and hanging out all the time. By the end of the summer I grew feelings for her, but she was moving across the country for school. I never told her I really liked her and even felt love developing.

I was lonely again once this new girl left for school and tried to stay in contact but it didn't seem she was very interested in me as anything more then we were.

I cycled through a few more girls over the next year and just never grew attached. I kept distance from them and made sure not to get attached. looking back I can see I sabotaged many of the relationships once I felt them getting attached.

Now when I turned 21 I was back at the same summer job but as a supervisor. I met another girl and kept my distance due to me being her boss. At the end of the summer we dated and it was going well. In the beginning I knew I was just dating her cause I knew she was interested and I just went with it. Once again I distanced and ended it once I saw her get attached. We were apart for around a month then I became lonely and got back together with her.

I only had my memory of my short intense relationship being what ""love"" is for me. So I didn't say it for a long time. I said it too soon and because the relationship was going down hill. The relationship got better but there were always bumps. Now we dated for just over two years and it just recently ended. I ended up running the summer job as the head boss for the last two years and it put a huge stress on the relationship during the months I was her boss. 

The relationship has gotten to the point where we were always fighting and just generally unhappy with each other. I began thinking of other women and wishing that she could just be like them. Things began getting awkward for me around her. For someone I loved I had no idea how to behave around her and began to doubt all my actions and interactions I had with her. She just ended the relationship and I felt nothing for the first 3-4 days. I was more happy it was over, because I can relax and not have to feel so stressed.

Now I am feeling really down and thinking about how great she was. I have matured a lot since I was 18 and realize that even though I miss her now, we won't work together. It is sad because I just can't see it working and I know I can't be what she needs, and she will be happier with someone else.

Right now I am feeling less need for the recent relationship to be back, and I am finding myself going over old footage and pictures of the happy gorgeous girl I met after my first bad break.

She is amazing and I never got a chance to tell her I liked her so much. But once again I don't know if it would work even if she lived here (she is living across the country doing an internship after her grad from university)

I really just want to have someone where it will work, and who I can trust without destroying the relationship before it even starts. I seem to have a lot of trust issues. I over think almost all of my interactions with people and have a hard time being real with someone, in fear of the outcome of what I share, and having them think differently towards me. I have a hard time dealing with rejection and even an acquaintance relationship is worth holding then letting someone I know my feelings and being rejected.

I just don't know what to do right now. I am going to focus on hobbies and getting back into shape now that I am single but as far as getting back out there I don't know if I can for a while.

If you read the entire thing, then sorry it was so long haha. I just wanted to share where I am. I am not looking for answers and suggestions but do appreciate them and want to read others input. I wish I had someone I could be honest with like this but I just feel I am a burden to them and no one wants to deal with it more then one day.

TL;DR
Just dated when I was 18. Lost virginity to a one night stand. She faked pregnancy, so I avoided girls for a bit. Dated an older woman and learned lots of sex but not emotional. met a girl at work who I was very attracted to. pursued her and ending up dating for 4 months really intensely. she fucked me up after the break. Almost right after the break met a gorgeous girl who I started to grow feelings for at the end of the summer. She moved for school. I cycled through a bunch of women over the next year. Met my last girlfriend and dated for two years. Didnt work and know it wont work between us. Have second thoughts on never telling the gorgeous girl how I felt and find myself caring more about that relationship now. Dont know what to do, or feel. I am really bad at relationships.

Thanks for reading, will come back for replies. Feel free to ask questions as well.

If you have experience regarding this, I'd really appreciate some advice/insight!",FoxhoundInc,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/zl639/hi_reddit_i_want_to_be_a_federal_agent_but_i_dont/,"I've been job-searching for the past couple months and it's been really draining and demoralizing. I hit dead ends everywhere.

I am a first-generation college student. My parents never put much value on academia and I am the only one of my siblings to have made it to college. I was born and raised in a high-crime neighborhood. Ultimately I want to go into law enforcement.

I surpassed my own expectations by making it into an arguably prestigious university. Being poor, I relied heavily on government loans for tuition, and a part-time job to pay the rent. After four years of struggling to skimp on food and clothing, putting as many hours as I was allowed into into my part-job to afford living expenses, while still trying to maintain my grades I finally graduated with two Bachelor's in Political Science and Sociology.

Now I am looking around for job opportunities in investigations or criminal justice on a federal level and there doesn't seem to be anything. It's my career goal to become an agent with a federal division; FBI, DEA, NSA, NCIS, and the like. Nearly all postings seem to require 2-5 years prior experience in investigations. So I search for investigations jobs on sites like simplyhired and indeed and monster, but other than shady private investigation companies and specialized local positions (e.g., public investigator for communicable diseases) there doesn't seem to be many means to gain practical experience.

I would love to do an unpaid internship with any of the aforementioned federal agencies, but for some reason, they all require you to be presently a student. I find this puzzling. When I was a student, there was no way I had time to put in X unpaid hours a week as well as work to pay bills and get decent grades. Furthermore, I took the bus everywhere, and any government agency is going to be located in the city where vehicular transportation is necessary to access. There is no way I could have thought about affording a car as a student. Now that I finally have graduated, and the time to intern, they don't want me, because I am not a student. How am I supposed to get the experience then?

Right now I'm crashing with a friend and trying to find a job that's tangentially relevant to my intended career, so I can pay back my loans and put down money for a car, while also finding unpaid volunteer opportunities to get practical experience and get my foot in the door. But the outlook is getting more and more bleak every time I fire up the laptop to search.

The last thing I want to do is go back home and move back in with my parents. Our relationship was strained to begin with, and where I come from, there is the kind of ""higher education is elitist"" attitude. I left with ambitions and high hopes, and I will end up coming back with no job, no upward mobility, but lots of student debt. There will be definitely an air of ""I-told-you-so"" shoved in my face.

Redditors, if any of you have any insight into this industry, please shed some light. I just don't understand how I can get the required experience to qualify. There are no entry-level jobs. I can't even apply for an internship because I am no longer a student. It just doesn't make sense to me. Thank you in advance."

As a civil engineering student from UoT, I realized had no almost job experience let alone one relevant to my degree. So to my luck I got an offer before my senior year. Problem is, it's for a small civil firm in the middle of nowhere in Saskatchewan with low pay and mostly office work.


Because of the necessity to actually have something on my resume before graduating, I immediately accepted the offer. The people at the office are great people, but I'm becoming extremely depressed. I had to break up with my boyfriend as he was going back to school and I was moving a province away (we both can't do long distance). Not only that but he's planning to move to the States for grad so I wouldn't even see him for another couple of years.


I'm so used to sleeping with him beside me that now I sleep on one side and can never sleep well anymore. I keep waking up, expecting him to be beside me but, no, just me by myself. I really miss him but when we saw each other for the last time (he had to go home for a month and that was when we semi-officially ended it), we were like strangers and he was acting so distant that I ended up trying to block him out of my life/avoid him completely (even though we had mutual friends and get-togethers before I left) as I was always on the verge of crying whenever I saw him acting like we never had anything.


I'm away from all my friends who are graduating this year and I'm in the middle of nowhere (there isn't even an ATM without 40 minutes of walking). I can't talk to any of my friends because they're all partying it up right now before classes start and then they'll be shut-ins working on final year projects. If I do manage to survive the year, I'm going to go back to my uni with no friends there, hardly any money to show for it and an enormous sense of loneliness.


This emptiness I'm feeling is starting to kill me inside I've only been working for 2 weeks but I'm terrified it's going to start making me a horrible employee, which would entirely defeat the purpose.


I feel so pathetic and sad."

I did an internship in the city last summer and want to move back in a few years and would love for her to enjoy the city as much as I do. Help me sell her on the city, AskNYC.

We're both working entry-level jobs but we'll be splitting the cost of the vacation. We're talking about doing a long weekend away (we live in Ohio) some time this fall, but I'm finding airfare and hotels to be fairly (and expectedly) expensive. 

Any hotel recommendations? I've looked into Sohotel, the Gershwin Hotel and quite a few others that I've stayed in before. I considered a hostel, but the idea of a romantic weekend with 5 other people in our room isn't attractive. 
Romantic, good, inexpensive things to do?

I have a few ideas, ranging from the High Line to going up into the ESB, depending on how cold it is by the time we go. I've never taken a girl out in NYC though so I don't know the good romantic spots, but I do know the city well enough to get around.

I'm trying to do this for around $600/person including airfare, hotel, food and entertainment. Hard to do, I know, but I'm pretty good at being frugal.

I figure (per person):
$150 airfare
$200 for hotel room
$40 for trains/taxis
$100 for food
$110 for entertainment/sight-seeing

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"

As I'm taking more Comp Sci classes, I'm noticing some people are completing multiple short internships with big(ger) name companies (bigger than the company I work for). So, this is my question:

To Potential Employers, would multiple internships(say, 4-6 months each) at mid to large size companies look more attractive than one job (focused on programming in JavasScript, Python, and some c#) that I stayed at for 5 years?

**TLDR: What looks more attractive on a resume: multiple short internships or one position held for 5 years?**

zohrm,8,2012-09-10,"21[M] went on two great dates with 21[F], then a series of increasingly shitty ones. ",throwaway215T,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zohrm/21m_went_on_two_great_dates_with_21f_then_a/,"Hey r/relationships, I know you give good advice and I could use some myself. I was dating a girl for a couple months, and it just fell apart. I need some help looking for answers.

I'm a 21 year old man in college, and I have no experience with women. This past spring, I met a girl in one of my classes and hit it off immediately with her. After a couple months, I asked her to hang out and smoke with me(I'm a big pot smoker) and she said sure. I texted her asking to smoke for several weekends in a row, and each time she would say she was busy, but she'd always make a rain date and she would act genuinely disappointed. 

Then one weekend, before we got a chance to smoke together, she asked me to be her date to her formal(she's in a sorority) which was a week before the semester ended. I went and we had a good time. I got pretty shitfaced(which I didn't intend to) but it wasn't like she was babysitting me or anything. We kept touching and flirting all night, and went to an afterparty together. We went back to her place, but she was falling asleep on the couch and I was hammered, so I decided to not push my luck and left for the night, especially since she kept telling me all night she wasn't a 'typical sorority slut'. I only got a hug on the way out. 

We went out once more before classes ended for the summer, the smoking date I asked her on a month ago, which went well. She completely did herself up for the date too, she had her hair done and everything. I tried apologizing for getting too drunk at her formal, but she wouldn't hear of it, so I know that wasn't the problem. She ended up inviting herself back to my place to meet my roommates, but had other plans later that night and left after like an hour(She told me that she had those plans when I picked her up earlier that night). The entire time she was at my place, I was sitting on my bed but she sat right down at my desk and didn't move. 

Then classes ended and she went home for two months. I kept up with her through texts and everything. When she got back she was starting an internship, taking online classes and going to the beach every weekend, so she was super busy. I only went out with her every couple weeks throughout the summer though. Something changed from the time classes got out to the summer starting. First, she bailed on the first date I asked her on when she got back(but I think it was cuz I picked a shitty movie). All our dates felt like first dates though, it never really went anywhere. We went out about 5 or 6 more times. I even told her that I really liked her, but couldn't tell if she was trying to nicely tell me she wasn't interested or if she was legitimately busy. Not that I thought she was lying about being busy, I wanted to make sure I wasn't bothering a girl who wasn't into me. She didn't directly tell me she liked me, but said she actually was always busy, and had never had so much to do in her life. Also, I should mention that I borrowed a textbook from her over the summer.

I always wanted to ask her back to my place after one of our dates, but she'd always throw up a roadblock at the last minute, like how she had some massive form to fill out for her boss that night, or that she had more homework or something. She'd also always find a way to avoid me walking her to her door, so I never got a chance to try and kiss her at the end of a date. Once, I took her out for dinner and then drove back to her place. She had my door open when my car was still moving and practically jumped out of my car. I figured Fuck it, she doesn't want to be with me, and I stopped talking to her.

She kept texting me and stuff though. One night she texts me asking if I wanted to hang out, and telling me she wanted to smoke too(I don't think she had in months b/c of work). When I got there, she told me that her roommates weren't there, so I had a good idea of what was going down. The entire time though, I sat in the middle of her couch, and she sat sideways on one side, resting her back on the armrest and facing me, but she kept her legs between us the entire time. I even got up to get water just so I could sit back down with my arm out to put it around her, and she sat as far away from my arm as she possibly could. We made small talk for like an hour after that, then I left.

After that, I'd texted her to hang out once or twice, and she wouldn't text me back, or text me a one word response. I think once I asked to hang out, and she didn't text me back, so I texted her again saying 'I guess not hahaha'. Pretty sure that was a mistake. A couple days later, I asked her if something was wrong and she said that we needed to talk, I was being crazy and creeping her out, and that it was hard to like me. I offered to meet up with her at a neutral, public place and she declined. She said she didn't have time for a relationship, and needed space. This was at the end of the summer, and at the time I was angry because I felt like she led me on all summer and dumped me right at the end. I assumed she was really busy and stressed out all summer, and didn't want to start a relationship at that time, but I had it in the back of my head that classes would start again in the fall and she'd have time for me. 

Last week, she asked me for that textbook back, which was strange because it was a useless textbook for a class she already passed and didn't need. I thought she would have let the book go to avoid seeing me again. I tried not to make conversation when I dropped the book off, trying to give her the space she said she wanted, and left without saying much past 'thanks for letting me use the book'. I realized though that I wasn't over her and still wanted to be with her. 
I texted her today, first asking if it was alright for me to ask her something and then I asked if she really thought I was a creep and what did I do wrong. She told me she didn't want to have that conversation. 

I really don't know what to make of this whole thing. I'm pretty sure she was in to me at some point at least, but beyond that I'm pretty much lost. I think one of a couple things happened: either it was slowly going bad the whole time but she was into me and let it slide until it was just too many little things going wrong, or I was an idiot and should have been more sexually aggressive and eventually she gave up, or it was going fine and I did something seriously wrong. Or maybe it wasn't my fault at all, but I doubt it. I could tell that the last few dates weren't going well, but I didn't know what to do to fix it because I didn't know what was going wrong. Where did I go wrong with this? I'd like to avoid making the same mistakes I did with this girl.

tl;dr I dated a girl for a couple months, she broke it off without much warning or indication. What did I do?"

Advice?,DUNGAROO,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zogw6/liberal_arts_grad_wanting_to_pursue_a_career_in/,"A little background: I'm 23 and graduated last year from a highly regarded state school with a BA in liberal arts and a 3.2 GPA. No internships, and never took a single business class during my undergrad. I've been consistently employed since I was 16 and currently work a full time job in facilities administration. I realize my job would be coveted by many (public sector, starting salary of $44k with annual $2,000 pay bumps, great benefits, pension, 35 hour work week) but it's simply not right for me. The work I do is not intellectually challenging enough and presents very little opportunity for upward mobility or lateral transfer later on. Generally when I leave to go home at the end of my work day at 4:30 when I'm supposed to everyone else in the office is already gone. I could work my ass off (and usually do) and never see a promotion or any form or recognition (bonuses do not exist in the public sector). On that same note I could show up to work 5 days a week do absolutely nothing and not be fired (performance expectations are relatively low, very little supervision, and a union to back me up should anyone ever question my work ethic). It sounds great but makes for a very frustrating environment to work in as the people who you depend on to support your own work could care less about the needs of the institution or efficiency.

So I've concluded that once I have a year of ""full time working experience"" under my belt I will leave. My next move will be in the direction of the business field, specifically finance. I would like to one day earn an MBA and am certain I could be accepted to the MBA program of the same school I completed my undergrad from. Why you ask? Because it's what interests me the most. I follow the business section closely and am always reading up trying to learn more about the world of finance and securities.

I acknowledge I'm already behind the curve ball. (It seems everyone going for ""entry-level"" positions in the business field have business majors and multiple internships under their belts). I've accepted that my next couple moves will likely involve pay cuts, long hours (I already work ~60 hrs a week with my second job in addition and the extra hours I elect to put in at my F/T), student loans, and additional schooling (I actually enjoy going to school). 

What should my next move be reddit? What positions should I be aiming for? Is there anything I can be doing now aside from studying on my own to put me in a better spot to land such a position when I start applying 6 months from now?"

I get in at 4:30 AM and see 2 patients.  I'm allowed to pick them at random, it doesn't really matter as they don't care about my note and during rounds I rarely even present these patients.  

Anyway, during rounds our job as the students is to grab the patient's charts and flip them to the physician order sheets so the interns can write down orders as we round.  During all this running around grabbing charts we are not able to listen to the conversation about each patient, and they don't want us to enter the rooms because it slows us down in getting the charts for them.  If we try to ask questions they brush us off.  Sometimes they just say it's a stupid question and walk away.  Today they said my patient had a hernia that I didn't notice, I asked if they could point it out to me and show me what it felt like, as I've never felt a hernia before.  They said ""we don't have the time to slow down and teach you guys these things.""

After that the first case in the OR shows up and one of us (there are 4 of us total) scrubs into it.  The rest of us have tried to then do attending rounds but the residents seem very against us going with them.  They just send us up to the OR, even though we can't scrub into any of the cases up there.

It's been a week and I've learned nothing at all and I have no idea who to complain to.  I feel like complaining to the residents will only make things worse, and complaining to the attendings (including the program coordinator) won't change anything about the residents, and once word trickles down to them they will just make it worse anyway.

I can't imagine I'm the first to have a horrible situation like this so what have others done before to fix it?"

Once I start school again, I'll be investing in many more canvases, get to painting, and get better pictures of the finished product in hopes of selling them, but I'm wondering if I'll even have success at that.

I have just finished my second year studying Comptuer Science, and I applied for an internship as a software tester in Leeds last week. From my CV, I managed to nab an interview for this Wednesday. I was given an assignment with a few questions to bring to the interview (already completed), and also told that I will have a programming test which will take no longer than 90 minutes. It will be in C# and in winforms.

Now, I've been preparing by reading though old notes, and Head First C# to help refresh my memory which goes into a surprising amount of detail in terms of forms. It's also help reinforce my knowledge with objects etc.

I was just wondering, does anyone what can I expect from the test? Or what I should brush up on most? Would be greatly appreciated.

edit: can also post the job spec and assignment questions if that would help anyone!

Thanks!"

**Post ID:** znx9m

**League:** Advanced


**Goal:** Fat loss

I'm aiming for a 20kg (45pounds) loss during the 12 weeks. We'll see how close to that goal i get to. I hope i don't lose too much muscle while doing this challenge, trying to eat enough protein.
I moved to another country about a month a go to do my internship.
Just to observe my health i had some blood taken from me and analysed, what it told me was that my blood sugar levels are through the roof and that usually means there is danger of diabetes. 

Well during the first month i really didn't do anything, but didn't eat much as well. Still i lost about 11kg. Then i saw the BTFC round 4 post on fitocracy's facebook feed and decided: 
""That is what i'll aim for, that contest is a perfect motivation and a fun way to lose all that extra weight i have carried my whole life. I do realize that it will take longer time to get that thick, solid and tight look, but i'm okay with that.. Everything takes time. I never really cared that much about my diet, love to lift heavy weights, been doing it for two years now.

My lifting motto:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWUcHKAj_tc

(Sorry for the grammar mistakes and bad inglish, not from an English speaking country)

Plan:
Diet about 1600-1800 kcal per day (mostly protein, med fat and low carbs)

Lifting 3x times a week, interval training 2-3x a week + walking

Weightlifting routine:

Mo: upper body push 'n pull

We: Shoulders 'n arms

Fri: Legs 'n chest

I guess you are wondering why so much upper body work. During these first two years i never really cared that much about the bench press, so my bench press is way inferior compared to my squat and deadlift. Hence a lot of arm and chest work.

Tu: Interval + walking

We: Interval + walking (intervals during morning)

Thu:Interval + walking

I'll probably add the measurements tomorrow since i don't have a tape measure yet

Oh yeah first post in here :))"

I can be pretty quiet until I get to know people and I've been working on that lately, this being just another step in that process. Other things you'll learn as you get to know me:

 -Love music, almost always have something playing. I lean more toward the metally/punkish/hardcore stuff, but there is also the part of me that listens to acoustic, rock, and even a bit of pop. I really need a concert buddy too. I also began trying to learn guitar this summer. 

-I do enjoy the occasional night out on the town with friends and would like to increase the frequency of that. 

-I play my share of games, and the other things that could be considered 'nerdy'.

But that's assuming I'm accepted, and if I end up going elsewhere I don't want to be stuck with a lease in Atlanta. 

It's awkward because the timespan (less than a year) is too long to just not do anything, but not long enough to justify applying for regular full-time positions.

I wouldn't call it awesome, because she's pretty moody and very very immature.

She has this very strange habit of getting really close to guys. Even when she's dating people. She did it with her previous ex as well. No, she doesn't make out/get physical with them, but she gets EXTREMELY emotionally attached. It gets to the point where most of her conversations revolve around The Guy, and they're constantly texting. Her life starts to revolve around that person, and she starts ignoring her boyfriend.

This happened three times with her ex before me (in a span of 2 years) and then it happened thrice with me (in 7 months). Every single time, after being told what she's doing, she has broken down severely, regretted about it and been confused about WHY she can never understand when she crosses lines. Her ex was VERY cooperative in trying to make her understand, and I was even more understanding... but she's understood NOTHING. Absolutely nothing. Her behavior is EXACTLY the same, still.

She was in a different city for an internship for 2 months. In those 2 months, she got really close to a guy [24m], made out with him once, and then completely dropped him. She told me about it and I guess it happened because she craved something physical, and then she dropped him because of the intense guilt. This is the only time she got physical with someone not her boyfriend. I'm sure of that.

A few weeks later, she got really close to another guy [27m] at her workplace. Here's the serious bit -- this guy is married (been married for a year only). He has a very troubled marriage, his wife seems to not give any shits about him, apparently doesn't come home a lot of nights etc. Again, my gf got REALLY close to him. It doesn't take much to guess that the troubled married guy got an outlet for everything. They text all day, video chat on Skype countless number of times. I happened to read an email she sent to him, and it made it very clear that they were having an affair.

More than being shattered, I was and am shit scared out of my wits. OK, she cheated on me twice. OK, we're done. But I know her inside out. She's a kid. She's immature, she's under-confident, she's very very unsure of what she's doing, and has no idea where her life is going. I can decide to forget her, which will take very little effort, but I can't bring myself to do it. Anything could happen with the married guy. If word gets out, if Guy goes for divorce, the affair could spill out and it would destroy her. She comes from a normal family and it would end up destroying her family as well. Already, people around her suspect something strange is going on. And considering how ""soft"" her personality is, I wouldn't count out self-physical-harm either. She has no ""best friends"" that she can take advice/help from. Really, she's broken in every manner possible.

Note: I am the only one who knows the full story. No other friend or family member does. I haven't shared this with anyone either.

Reddit, I don't know what to do. I really don't. If there's anything that will make her understand or realise what she's doing, I'd be willing to try it. I don't care if she hates me for her entire life, but I'll be happier with her hating me and having an OKAY life, than having NO life at all.

**tl;dr: Ex-girlfriend has crazy habit of getting emotionally attached to random guys, is now having an secret affair with a guy who is in a troubled marriage. She's an ex, but I want to, if possible, drill sense in her head and not see her destroy her and her family's life.**"

so here's a deal , i graduated from UoA a few months ago, degree in CompSci.

Been applying for jobs ever since. Got 1-2 interviews,  ..one being recently , still waiting for news , but it's been a week so i'm guessing that's off the table.  (they had me sit a test, 3 questions on web services and array/loops ..i got 2/3 correct)


I'm interested in web dev /programming ( C# , .NET , JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, HTML/CSS , ASP.NET , Web Services).
Right now i'm also doing some self learning, but it's hard to find good material with clear precise instructions online on stuff like ASP.NET...and MVC.

Books in library are even more outdated.

So 2012 for me will most likely be a bust year, but there's still 3 months left of it ....and i don't wanna waste it too much .

I've been discussing with my parents and they suggested getting a certification.

But i've looked around geekzone, and people are saying getting certs like MCTS  or MCICTP  etc etc doesn't help if you're just getting ""your foot in the door"" and that it's more suitable for people who's already working in IT and their employers want them to get a certificate.

Can you guys experienced (and seasoned dare i say) IT people give me advice ?

As far as NCEA LV3 (graduated high school)  and a Bachelor of CompSci from UoA.....i have Zero work experience ...i never had a part time job in high school or uni (subway etc etc) ........and i don't even have a referee. I feel like hs dip and Bach degree is nothing without those exp.

Should i get a random ""flippin burgers"" PT jobs to help my CV ?   i doubt it tho ...i dunno, confused right now.

Last night i went to the AMES IT website , and looked at their certs,
The only one i'm kinda interested in is  "" MCTS - ASP.NET &amp; Web application  (microsoft certified tech specialist)   ...it's 12 weeks , ends in december-ish , cost  ...$5300 ..( Ughhh)    , teaches asp.net, javascript ...and gets you the certification test.

what i wanna ask is , is it useful ? is ames any good or as **** as people "" say""  ? .....   Microsoft's USA site says "" MCTS has ended development, but those with the certificates are still recognized ""  ......i don't wanna be getting a cerfiticate from a program that has been discontinued ....why are ames stil offering it ?
The test itself is like a written-exam right ?  i did that alot in UNI,  very little practical stuff .....employers prefer practical exp vs written knowledge right.

I don't even know how to get a java certification in NZ ...who offers it.

I know some people just learn on their own from various sources and just book a test at that ""pro.somethingsomething"" test center in Auckland .... $100 or something as opposed to 5K .......but i can't find a thorough step by step tutorial on ASP.NET , MVC, javascript online that's decently good.
And no way of knowing what's in the test..........


I""m more than willing to work for free for 2 weeks or as part of an internship on any company in Auck if need be.  at this point, the experience is more important than $$ ....i'm not focused on that at all right now.

so,  ...help a brother out ?"

So 2012 for me will most likely be a bust year, but there's still 3 months left of it ....and i don't wanna waste it too much .

I've been discussing with my parents and they suggested getting a certification.

But i've looked around geekzone, and people are saying getting certs like MCTS  or MCICTP  etc etc doesn't help if you're just getting ""your foot in the door"" and that it's more suitable for people who's already working in IT and their employers want them to get a certificate.

Can you guys experienced (and seasoned dare i say) IT people give me advice ?

As far as NCEA LV3 (graduated high school)  and a Bachelor of CompSci from UoA.....i have Zero work experience ...i never had a part time job in high school or uni (subway etc etc) ........and i don't even have a referee. I feel like hs dip and Bach degree is nothing without those exp.

Should i get a random ""flippin burgers"" PT jobs to help my CV ?   i doubt it tho ...i dunno, confused right now.

Last night i went to the AMES IT website , and looked at their certs,
The only one i'm kinda interested in is  "" MCTS - ASP.NET &amp; Web application  (microsoft certified tech specialist)   ...it's 12 weeks , ends in december-ish , cost  ...$5300 ..( Ughhh)    , teaches asp.net, javascript ...and gets you the certification test.

what i wanna ask is , is it useful ? is ames any good or as **** as people "" say""  ? .....   Microsoft's USA site says "" MCTS has ended development, but those with the certificates are still recognized ""  ......i don't wanna be getting a cerfiticate from a program that has been discontinued ....why are ames stil offering it ?
The test itself is like a written-exam right ?  i did that alot in UNI,  very little practical stuff .....employers prefer practical exp vs written knowledge right.

I don't even know how to get a java certification in NZ ...who offers it.

I know some people just learn on their own from various sources and just book a test at that ""pro.somethingsomething"" test center in Auckland .... $100 or something as opposed to 5K .......but i can't find a thorough step by step tutorial on ASP.NET , MVC, javascript online that's decently good.
And no way of knowing what's in the test..........


I""m more than willing to work for free for 2 weeks or as part of an internship on any company in Auck if need be.  at this point, the experience is more important than $$ ....i'm not focused on that at all right now.

so,  ...help a brother out ?"
zn5cb,3,2012-09-10,Has anything like this happened anywhere else?,xistag,Staples,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staples/comments/zn5cb/has_anything_like_this_happened_anywhere_else/,"Well, I've been snooping around this subreddit quite a bit tonight but I figured I might as well add this to the stack.

I am a CP Associate that started at my store in May of this year. I told them up front that I have an internship I would be leaving for five weeks after my hire date but that once I was back I would plan on being there for a while. (the internship was 8 weeks). Even with this, they hired me on and put me in front of a computer for training the next week.But once the computer training was over, I pretty much got slaped behind the counter and told good luck.
I was so confused. The computer modules only cover so much of the job. As far as customer service, I am used to it. I've worked in customer service related positions for about 5 years now, not to mention Disney for nine of those. Naturally I had questions most of the day, but any time I had a question I was ridiculed for how I dealt with the customer or how unprofessional I was. I didn't know how to take this because it's not like I don't know how to be professional. I am simply not trained as much as I would like to be. So I started asking co-workers instead of managers. That only made matters worse. It turns out the way they have been doing things is /also/ the wrong way to do it, only leading to more riddicule and when I tried to say that it was how someone else was doing it, they did not believe me. So all in all I felt stuck.

About a week before I left for my internship, I had a day this is difficult to shake from memory. The events leading up to this are hazy, but I was completing an order of 50 full sheet letter size laminations when my manager came up and said they wanted to have a discussion with me. At this point I knew they were going to tell me yet again how I've done something wrong, but it was different. They were now telling me that they don't think I am a very good fit for Staples and that I should consider whether or not I want to continue working here. I couldn't believe what I was hearing and it grit a deep hole inside of me that day. 
A bit of background info would be that my major is related to what is done inside the department. I took the job (and the pay cut hopping over to this job) in order to better myself and gain experience with the terminology involved. The equipment and the functions involved are second nature to me, but I feel that my manager has become the source of a lot of judgementalism and any time they are around me now I tense up and get nervous, because it is in that moment that everything I am doing is wrong. Sometimes as far as undoing anything I had learned in college relating to print.

Well regardless of that day, I worked there a couple more days and then went to my internship. I came back to find my nametag had been taken off of my apron. I inquired about it and the managers there had no clue about it but gave me what seemed like a ready made nametag, but this was different. This one no longer said ""Copy Print Associate"" it now read ""Sales Associate"". To make a long story short, since that time (about a month now), i have been doing small jobs around the store, not even allowed to go anywhere near copy and print. Anytime I try to help minimize a line or even print a job I am told to go back to what I was doing. I feel like I'm being corralled like a retard and this has made my job that much more of a hell for me. I can't tell you guys how much I feel out of my element now. 

So I must ask, if there are any tips you guys might have for my situation or anything. I've been asking my GM for an explanation but all he is telling me are unspecific remarks about ""cross-training"". But they sound more like dodgey answers than anything real. I've gone as far as asking if I will be back in copy and print anytime soon. I have yet to get a yes or a no. :/"

So I will be graduating with a bachelors from a top 20 program in EE.  I have a 3.2 GPA (+/- .05) and will be finishing an internship this week that has lasted 10 months.

The internship was with a medium sized government contractor and was your typical 9-5 office job.  I enjoyed the work I did but I found most of the days I spent were doing scrub programming work and it got monotonous fast.

I plan on specializing in controls and robotics and was looking at shift jobs in the oil and gas industry as a possible fit.  I think it would be a great experiences to get a contract overseas on an offshore rig and work x weeks on and y weeks off.

So, anyone here with professional experience in engineering work a job that is not the typical 9-5 and is ""entry level"" for a future fresh grad like myself.  If so, please share your experiences and tell me how you got it.  Bonus points if it involves a lot of travelling"

Those experiences have lead me to a few consulting jobson top of this. The money I make through all of this isn't enough to live off and the hours are now minimal so I am still looking for a full-time marketing job (or at the very least part-time). 

I have two questions: I revamped the whole marketing of my family business every which way including a marketing plan and the whole nine yards along with a portfolio of tangible accomplishments to show. How do I approach the question if they ask for a reference from this family business? I have a ton of references from several previous internships and the like that I'd prefer to give.

And what of my consulting job that is part-time? Will that be a deterrent for an employer if I mention that I do freelance consulting and am still part-time employed by both this and the family business? I have them both listed as currently working at on my resume.

Just looking for anyone's two cents. Thank you!"

I'm a recent college grad who's been searching for about 8 months for an EL actuarial position...without much luck at all. I've been able to attract enough interest for many companies to call me for phone interviews, but I've only had 2 on-site interviews within my 8 month search. I feel like my confidence is getting slowly eroded away to the point where I even started looking at getting a masters in actuarial science. Unfortunately, going back to school would double my student loan amount, which is a financial burden that I'm unwilling to subject myself to at this point.

I feel like my only remaining options are to start cold-calling/cold-emailing actuaries from the SOA directory...or just keep plugging along and hope I find something.

Is anyone else having difficulty finding an actuarial position? EL or otherwise?

Edit: Just for background purposes, I'm a math major, 2 exams passed, and my work experience consists of an actuarial internship and several years worth of working at an insurance agency."

Now the problem is that this girl happens to live about 400 miles away form me and she is probably going away maybe even further for an internship for the next 6 months...

When she got back to school after we had our dates and such we continued to chat and it was all happy and dandy untill she started school again and we started talking a little bit less everyday and she got more and more work on her shoulders although we still chat almost everyday.

but the last weeks has been hell for me emotionally because i may have fallen completley in love with this girl and i think she knows and she has been a little off and i really wanted to know how she felt about me since i felt so stupid writing to her all the time with me being the one to always write her and not vice-versa made me feel desperate and unsecure... So anyway we have a good friend in common and i asked him to talk with her to kinda get a grip of how she felt about me ( i didnt ask myself because i did not want to put any emotional pressure on her, since she is already fed up with the workload and is stressed out) he then told me she had said ""i really like him but maybe not in the same way right now ( basically he is awesome and i like him but for now i just want to be friends with him"") and that made me really sad and confused... ""right now""? what does that mean? i understand the circumstances for a possible relationship is horrible but if the feelings are there form both parties its still possible..

So what i got out from that was that she likes me and there may be potential between us but under these circumstances with the long distance and her internship and workload she dosnt really have time for a relationship!?

My questions are: Should i just chat with her and ""stay friends"" or should i just give it up and try to forget about her for the moment being?

If i stay friends with her i fear that she would just start seeing me as a friend and the romance we had would never come to be again (friend-zoned?) or if i stop talking to her and try to be more passive maybe to the spring when she gets back home ( where i live ) i could ask her out again? (and start ""fresh"")?

What would you do reddit? How would you handle this situation? What is the best way i can handle this to still be able to have a chance of her being something more than a friend? Or is it all hopeles


Tl;dr Met a girl she moves away she likes me but right now she just wants to stay ""friends"" because of work/no-time/far away/...

should i keep up our relationship as a friend or should i be passive and ignore it until the next time when she will be coming back home? What are the pros/cons on how to relate to this so i still have a chance of being with her as more than a friend in the future

Edit: I think there is a really good chance this could lead into something under the right circumstances but i have to be really careful of how i should handle the situation soo i dont ruin my chances"

I was a semester away from graduating with a BFA in fine art (painting) when I learned about an amazing and incredibly underfunded/appreciated facility on my campus.  It is a zoological collection of 25k specimens, some dating back to the 1850s (about 10 years before the start of the American Civil War if that helps you put it into perspective).  All of the specimens are crammed into a room the size of a small classroom and is curated by one part-time staff member.  Zoological collections are incredibly important, not only to the campus and community it services but to the world as a whole as we deal with current ecological problems on our rapidly changing planet.  

I was an intern for a semester and went on to continue volunteering after graduating as much as possible (about 30hrs/week) along with working 35hrs/week at a paying gig.  Due to some personal issues I quit my wage job and began volunteering fulltime, 40+ hours a week, and also began authoring a blog about the collections.  [My blog](http://umzoology.tumblr.com) has reached some amount of Internet fandom (6,500+ followers and counting), but I still feel as though I'm not doing enough.  I have made this museum my life, and I feel responsible for its fate, mostly because I have the impression that no one of any solid authority is taking responsibility for its future.  

In the last year we have had many setbacks and run into a slew of problems.  Our ichthyology collection consists of 3,500 specimens in alcohol which are stored in cardboard boxes in an unventilated electrical room, despite all building, health, and safety codes.  Last May a boiler sprang a leak and many of the boxes became wet and collapsed.  We had to call in the fire and police departments to help cleanup, and despite that short episode of excitement, nothing has been done to move the fish from their current location.  You can see that event [here.](http://umzoology.tumblr.com/post/23549550409/savethefishii)

I am at a loss of what to do next.  I enrolled in the Johns Hopkins MA in Museum Studies program which allows me to get a graduate degree while staying in my current collection, I have contacted the Administration of UM to raise awareness, but still we get very few donations and very little changes.  Don't you agree this is a facility worth investing in and maintaining?  Am I totally jaded in thinking that this is important, and deserves time, attention, and care?  I spend most of the day by myself trying to maintain the current requirements of day-to-day tasks along with salvaging specimens that predate this *century*, deinfesting endangered species, trying to raise awareness.  Sometimes I just wish I had a little help form my friends. 

TL;DR: work for an underfunded/underappreciated museum and I'm afraid it's going by the wayside and there's nothing I can do to help despite everything I've done.  "

Ever since I was a little tyke, my mom would read to me every single day. I remember being two or three years old and reading the book along with my mom in my mind. When I got to first grade, I never struggled with reading. It was just like reading the Cat in the Hat or Green Eggs and Ham with mom, except with different wording. In first grade, I was placed in the back of the room because the other students would get discouraged whenever I raised my hand, because I was right almost every time. 

Being the youngest child, I suffered from the traditional ""look at me"" syndrome. As a result, I really liked being the smartest kid in class. It brought me attention that was looked fondly upon in society, and it brought me a sense of superiority over other students, even if I only ever recognized that concept in my mind while playing with my friends during recess or interacting in class.

As we progressed in elementary school, I remember one day where I realized that being able to read better than everyone else was a skill I no longer had, as everyone was essentially on the same page (ha, pun). I then proceeded through middle school without ever getting any grade lower then a B, because that was my only way to maintain my edge that I had cherished so much as a 1st grader. 

High school progressed, and I basically ran the table. Valedictorian, Homecoming King, Class President, full academic scholarship to college, and above average in the sports I played in. 

The driving force behind so much of that was still maintaining that edge. I made the connection between money and power. In 1st grade, reading Harry Potter may have put me ahead of everyone else, but as adults, having a six or seven figure salary was the trick. 

If you look at the definition of psychopath, it includes having shallow emotions, superficial charm, impulsiveness, and a need for stimulation. I certainly feel for others I'd like to think, but I would be flat-out lying if I solely judge myself when talking to others to see if I can am dominant or not. 

I workout several days a week, and although I am not physically imposing (5' 9''), I still have a very muscular build and am in very good shape, as it is important to me that people can see me and respect me at first glance for being ripped or in great shape. 

In college, I currently have an internship at a large firm and am majoring in Accounting and Management. I chose these majors because although science may provide a steady stream of high-paying jobs, the opportunity in the financial world to get mega-rich was very alluring to me. 

I sometimes wonder if too much of my life has been centered around wealth and power (wealth in itself is a symbol of power). Has this internal motivation of mine provided me with great amounts of opportunity and success? I'd think yes. But at what cost? I know that I am hopelessly screwed if I fail, because I will have failed at basically everything I have ever worked for in my life. 

And for what it's worth, movies like Ocean's 11, Dark Knight, and Dark Knight Rises intrigue me to no end because the villains or freakin' Danny Ocean have such thorough plans executed that put the balls of their opponent right in the clenched fist. And I wonder to myself if I could ever pull off such a feat? So many criminals in today's world are seemingly foolish. I am curious to know if I could ever break the system and get away with it, like a Ponzi Scheme that never gets ousted. 

Am I alone? Have any of you corrupted your thoughts or motivations like I do? So many of my friends don't have that natural killer instinct that I do when it comes to striving for success. I know I can't be the only one. 



tl;dr Everything in my life has been driven by power and money, and Bane and the Joker are my idols. "

I'm a 23 y.o. male born and raised here in Minnesota. I just started my last semester studying Information Technology. I'm also finishing up an internship over the next few weeks. I'm ready to be done with school and move on with the next part of my life. I can be pretty quiet until I get to know people and I've been working on that lately, this being just another step in that process. 

Other things you'll learn as you get to know me:

-Love music, almost always have something playing. I lean more toward the metally/punkish/hardcore stuff, but there is also the part of me that listens to acoustic, rock, and even a bit of pop. I really need a concert buddy too. I also began trying to learn guitar this summer. 

-I do enjoy the occasional night out on the town with friends and would like to increase the frequency of that.

-I play my share of games, and the other things that could be considered 'nerdy'. 

If you're still reading this, thanks. And if you want to know anymore I'd love to hear from you.

I majored in Econ and Political Science and graduated Cum Laude with a 3.5 GPA. I've taken some challenging econ courses (econometrics, forecasting) but I feel like a BA hasn't gotten me anywhere. I come from a low to middle class background. When I first started college, my first two years consisted of going to the gym and going to parties. I never got involved in any clubs, volunteering, or internships. 

The summer after my sophomore year, I did a study abroad in Africa studying history. The summer after my junior year, I volunteered tutoring poor, uneducated people who were trying to get their GED and as a counselor for urban youth in the inner city. During my last year, I was a development intern at a non profit for two days a week for an entire year. Although I met some cool people, I feel like I didn't really do much with this stuff and didn't learn any important skills. 

Now I'm stuck at home with my parents and I can't find a full-time salaried job. 
I want to work in Research/Public Policy but I can't get any of those kinds of jobs. After months of searching, mostly on idealist, I landed two research related internships in Washington D.C. They were both really awesome, but were unpaid and I couldn't afford to spend anymore money. 

I hate when people ask me what I'm doing all the time, especially my extended family. I feel like I've fucked up because most of my friends and cousins are already making bank. I don't want to work in corporate because its not me and I don't have the experience. I also can't afford to go back to school. I didn't go to an ivy league school and my resume is not that exciting. People have told me to join the peace corps or the marines but I want to stay and help my parents with the mortgage and car loans.

Can I find a job with the skills I have? What can I do? Will I ever get an actual salary doing something I really enjoy? I've tried networking, finding unpaid stuff near me, and learning more skills online, but it all seems pointless. I can't focus, i'm not motivated, and I wish I was in grade school again. I'm frustrated and sometimes depressed. Is there any hope? HELP!

English is my native tongue.
I am fluent in Mandarin Chinese. 
I spent the past 13 months in Beijing. During this time I worked as a BD and marketing specialist for a software start-up and also did a short internship at a prominent social networking firm. I left the marketing job b/c I had to return home to finish my degree and research project.

I am considering moving back to Beijing after I graduate. On the other hand, I am also considering moving to Australia b/c one of my long term goals in life is to move to a country aside from the US that better fits the lifestyle I want. I visited Australia once as a child. I have a cousin who lived in Sydney for 11 years when his company posted him there.

We share a genetic condition so we see each other every two years at the national convention for this specific condition. This year I find out that she thinks I am very cute and I start to look at her less as a friend I see every once in a while at these things, and instead as a possible fuck buddy. We bang at the con and it was a fantastic time, and then spend the next month trading texts and phone calls. At the time I knew it was infatuation, and I was also just getting out of a relationship so I was really just looking for someone to have fun with not a serious relationship. A few weeks after the convention I spend the weekend at her place and after starting to actually get to know her I realize that this girl is a great fit for what I am looking for in a relationship, and start developing feelings for her. We continue to talk and text and it seems that she is developing similar feelings for me. Fast forward a bit and she is starting grad school, we both knew that realistically because of the distance between us and the amount of time she was going to need to spend focused on school a relationship wouldn't be a good idea because one of us would start to feel neglected or feel like they were neglecting the other person and it would go down hill and as we both want a relationship between us to actually work long term we weren't willing to try distance and fail. So we continue being FWB and things are good right? 

Well the last visit was a strange one. The last couple times I have been to visit her, we are very couple-y and almost acting as if we are dating, yet this time she would swing from acting like that to 5 minutes later being very firm about the fact that she can't date me right now, and that she isn't perfect for me, and I should go out and try to date other people to make sure that I find exactly what I want, and not just her because this is easy and fun. Every time I reassured her that I understand the boundaries and expectations of the relationship, and that yes I would love to eventually get together with her because even though she isn't perfect (but honestly who is) she is a much better match than any other girl I have been with, and with us both having the same genetic condition we both completely understand a big part of eachother's life that no one on the ""outside"" will ever be able to fully understand. It just feels like when I am not there it is easy to put me and her feeling for me aside, but then the moment I show up it all comes rushing back and she is almost trying to talk herself out of liking me because she doesn't want to get hurt / hurt me. And to complicate things even more, I have managed to fall completely head over heels in love with this girl (though I haven't told her that much yet). 

It is just hard because I am trying to be easy and put no pressure on her, yet at the same time maintain some presence (for instance every morning when I wake up I text her good morning beautiful because I know that if I can make her smile first thing in the morning the stress of the day will be just bit less) but trying to be careful because I don't want to smother her and then get pushed away completely. In the long run I can deal with her not loving me back, I can deal with us giving a relationship a shot and it not working out, but I just don't want to lose her in my life. In one month I managed to get into 2 serious accidents (neither were my fault, but that is another story), and breakup with someone I had been dating for 4 years, not to mention a few other personal issues and she was there through all of it being the one thing I could completely count on. Seeing texts from her or hearing her ringtone could instantly pull me out of the worst mood and put me into an amazing one. I guess I am just worried that if I continue to be easy and put no pressure on this that there is the possibility that a classmate or fellow intern could swoop in and steal this girl from me, but if I put pressure on it to do distance (even though I would spend basically every weekend at her place because it is a 45 minute plane ride and financially I can afford that) until my lease is up and I can move closer to her I am scared that I could loose her that way too. 

**TL:DR** 
Became FWB with girl I have known for a long time. Between distance and school she doesn't want a relationship but even though she has feeling for me. I fell head over heels in love with her, and am now worried that if I continue to be laid back that I will lose her to someone else, but if I put pressure on it I will lose her because she will push me away completely.

I want a real job, one that lasts 12 months instead of 9, with a regular schedule. Right now I work 60-70 hours a week for less than poverty level wages. However, I clearly lack the imagination to figure out what kinds of jobs I can even do with my LA degree. I'm just looking for a run of the mill office job, I will move anywhere and have no unrealistic salary aspirations except earning at least a living wage. 

Teaching is a dead end. High school wants a degree in education, community college and 4-years want a Ph.D WITH teaching experience (becoming harder and harder to get because of massive education budget cuts at my school). 
Public history positions (museum, archives etc.) are also looking for more experience than I have (I have two summers of internships, and an MA in public history). Most positions I have seen are looking for 3-5 years of experience even for entry-level. 


Are there any websites out there where I can plug in my experience, and education and see a list of potential job-types (not necessarily actual positions, just potential jobs) because those related to my field are non-starters (and my struggles in my Ph.D program have destroyed my love of the subject and desire to continue anyway). 


Does anybody else have similar experiences in this matter? Any other liberal arts majors who can chime in?

Some Halo PC modding. Mods ranged from simple projectile replacement (ex: make a sniper rifle fire rockets) and eventually some which reworked the combat system (made it melee only or removed shields entirely) and toying with how vehicles worked.

Attempted mapping in Jedi Knight 3. I eventually *did* come close to completion of a small map with functioning lighting and spawns, but no AI routing.

While it's not technically modding, I avidly used the Forge map editing tool for Halo 3/Reach. I have 10+ fully-functioning maps and many more which are unfinished.

I developed a few Flash games last year as part of a larger technology class, focusing mainly on web design. Most of this class was HTML and the like, but Flash was covered. I also learned C++ and Java in unrelated classes earlier in my school career.

I've been cut off from tools for a while now though, as the only computer in the house is my dad's laptop from 2008. I already have a student license for 3DS Max, but nowhere to install it. I plan on making a few trial items for Team Fortress 2, I believe my experience in mapping from JK3 may aid me in familiarizing myself with Max.

Now then, on to the questions. Since I am now a senior in high school, I need to start planning for college. I have heard from a professor at a local university that a Computer Science degree will get me farther than degrees such as game design or game programming. Is this true? Any courses I should strongly consider?

My dream studio job is as an environmental artist (mapping and architecture) at either Valve Software or Bungie (big surprise, given the 3 listed Halo titles). They ask for professional experience in the industry, what's a good way to *start* and get some professional experience?

My school has a game design club. But like most amateurs, probably +80% is composed of idealists who think they're making a AAA-level game as their first project. I've stopped attending because of this mindset, as I believe they're getting almost nowhere with this sort of goal. Should I attend and do what I can? Or should I find something more productive in my free time?

**TL;DR:** Is computer science a strong degree for college if I want to be in the gaming industry? If not, what would you suggest? What colleges offer the best courses in that degree? Where do I begin to get the often-requested ""professional experience""? Is it a good or bad idea to attend my school's game design club, no matter how unrealistic their ideas are? Also unlisted, is an internship at any local studios a good way to get some first-level experience?"

While watching TV the other day I saw an ad for Rob Sobhani, an independent running for senate. I didn't really care much for the senate race, Cardin and Bongino are both run of the mill democrats and republicans, and Cardin is favored to win by a long shot. Cardin has voted with his party around 97% of the time, been in politics for 40 years, and Bongino who's funding is dwarfed by Cardin's was recently endorsed by Sarah Palin. So I started looking into Sobhani and have been pleasantly surprised that he seems to be a really serious candidate with resources and decently thought out plans. I'm disappointed too that there is little coverage of his candidacy from the local mainstream media, though you'd think they would find it would add a bit of excitement to the race. So I did a bit of research myself to get people a bit more excited for their senate race

- He's an academic, taught at Georgetown, writes lots of op eds, is a Middle East expert, and owns a company specialized in infrastructure, green energy, and consulting.
- His 5 point plan is to marry Maryland to the international market by seeking private funds in the billions for roads and bridges, reconstruction of homes in Baltimore, cancer/alzheimer research, exports, and internships for low-income students. 
- He's big on promises: won't seek more than 2 terms and promises to not run for a 2nd term if he doesn't keep his promises.

His plans raise a lot of questions so I hope that they will release more information soon and that other media will pick up so we can learn more. 

Looking at the pitiful state of Congress, we need to support independent candidates even in states like Maryland. He looks to be moderate, a lot less focused on social issues and much more on economic/business ones. If somehow he can bring in all that money from private funds rather than increasing further our debt, why not ?

Thoughts ? I've included a blog right under which provides a pleasant read.

Update: The speech went great!  I ran out of time (I thought they said 30 mins originally but I was told 20 when I arrived and I got cut off by the class bell), but I had a lot of students come up afterwards with questions related to your suggestions of starting a home lab, various appropriate college degrees, where to find internships and side jobs, and whether or not they would be well suited to IT.  The organizers asked if they could send some students over to sit in on some of our staff inservices (we have weekly staff inservices on Fridays), and if they could send some to do job shadowing.  I had a lot of great questions from the kids and you guys gave a lot of great insight that I think helped them to better understand what a career in IT would be like.  Thanks r/sysadmin!"

My girlfriend is currently doing an internship at a ""Sea Life"" aquarium. The thing is, the internship is part of her undergrad , so she needs a research topic.

She has access to 3 years worth of data if she needs it (I'm not sure what's in it besides water quality related information and food). Her idea was to do some number crunching with these, but one of her teachers didn't liked the idea that much and gave her the idea of weighting the fish to try to relate water quality &lt;-&gt; appetite.

The thing is, she can't really weight the fish, so someone from the aquarium sugested that she tried to relate water quality &lt;-&gt; fish mortality. Still, she might not have sufficient data for that and that might still not be approved by her teacher.

So, do you guys have any idea what she could try to do (or how she can easily measure a fish's appetite)?

**TL;DR** My gf is doing an internship at sealife and need a research topic, any ideas?"

zpv5s,11,2012-09-11,To those applying for the College Program in Spring: Some tips and advice for the phone interview.,puapsyche,wdwcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wdwcp/comments/zpv5s/to_those_applying_for_the_college_program_in/,"Put together from stuff DIS people and I wrote on college program. I did my CP Spring Advantage 2011 and applied, interviewed for, and am now on a Professional Internship.

**HOW TO MAKE A LIST OF THINGS TO SAY IN THE INTERVIEW**
1. Think of the roles you want to apply for. Doesn't matter what it is, just think of the roles.

2. Identify what makes someone THE BEST at that role. Not just good, the best. What does the picture perfect cast member look like? If you want to be a Fairy Godmother in training, what in your mind is a perfect FGiT?

3. Think of that list of traits and qualities, and then think of how many of those you exemplify or that experience has given you. For example, if you're applying for Concierge and you know Concierge folk have to be friendly and welcoming, and you've gotten lots of experience and were told you were definitely friendly and welcoming, that's a good thing. Write it down.

4. Now you have a list of things YOU'RE good at that match what the PICTURE PERFECT CAST MEMBER is good at. It may not match completely, but that's OK. You now want to remember stories of your experiences- what was one EXCEPTIONAL time that you displayed the traits you know you're good at? If you're having trouble, try thinking back to times you had to deal with difficult Guests/customers, and situations like those where you handled it well. Remember several of these stories, and write them down. The more the better.

5. Practice recalling these stories out loud until they are natural. 

6. You're all set. Now all you have to do is, whenever they ask a question of you, see if you can answer the question by steering the conversation in the direction of your experiences. 

**QUESTIONS SOMEONE WAS ASKED DURING THEIR INTERVIEW**

1. We talked about my past work experience and she asked which job that I’ve had has been my favorite. 

2. The ever important why you want to work for Disney and if I’d ever consider working full time with Disney. This is definitely something you’re going to want to have an answer prepared for as it is always asked. I was also asked if I had a favorite park or attraction. 

3. Would you rather work in groups or independently? 

4. How would you describe your work pace?

5. She of course asked what my top 3 roles were and asked if I would be interested in adding custodial or housekeeping. She made a comment about how I had a good long list of roles at the beginning of the interview. This really made me nervous even though she said there was no right or wrong answer and after I said no, she just said ok and we moved on. It’s quite common for interviewers to ask if you’re willing to add roles such as QSFB or housekeeping to your checklist as these are roles that require a lot of people but not many people want. If you really don’t want to do them, don’t be afraid to say no. I said my top 3 were Attractions, Merchandise, and Character Attendant. 

6. Why do you want to be a character attendant?

7. What have you done in your past jobs where you’ve made a guest feel special?

8. How would I instill Disney magic from beginning to end at the entrances? Or something like that. This was a question directed towards Main Entrance Operations.

9. Do you have any cash handling experience? I mentioned working at a fast food restaurant at the beginning and after asking this she was like, “Oh at Culvers’, right?” 

10. She asked about my experience speaking in front of groups and how it makes me feel. I mentioned most of my experience was from presentations in class so she asked what the longest speech I’ve had to memorize was. 

11. She also asked how I’d feel about doing a job that was repetitive. Then she asked what I’d do if I was interrupted while giving a speech or something."

zpuco,3,2012-09-11,"Jay-Z is Right to Critize Occupy Wall Street’s Lack of Direction, (but they are not completely to blame).",TomCollins7,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/zpuco/jayz_is_right_to_critize_occupy_wall_streets_lack/,"Recently, highly-acclaimed rapper/businessman/ex-drug dealer has criticized OWS for its lack of stated goals, and its accompanying lack of success in doing anything other than camping out in the middle of a municipal park and providing a real life open forum for the airing of grievances and the exchange of ideas. http://www.metro.us/newyork/Local/article/1151608--jay-z-criticizes-occupy-wall-street.  Indeed, during the first two weeks of the protest, the traders and bankers were the first to voice Jay’s criticisms, stating that in order to negotiate or gain something, you must first list your demands. In some regards, Jay-Z and the traders are absolutely right to label OWS as a directionless, naïve, and pretentious failure. I hope our brave teachers in Chicago fare much better and write in solidarity with them (as pathetic as that sounds). 


I want to say a few things to anyone bored enough to read this as to what OWS should be blamed for and what they should not be blamed for in terms of their protest’s utter failure to do anything but sully a public park and subject us all to bad music. I’m going to do this by comparing these protests with the student protests/strike that I witnessed first-hand in Paris in the summer of 2006. There are several assumptions that I need to highlight here before we can continue. 


There can be some debate as to whether it is fair to compare OWS failures to the successes of the student strike against the CPE. Indeed, there is some debate as to whether or not it is fair to label the student successes a success. A little background: the CPE was a jobs reform plan that was intended to make it easier for business owners to hire students. Before it was proposed, once you hired a student to intern at your business, it was practically impossible to fire them. The CPE proposed to introduce a 6-month “trial period” wherein the means of production who employed students could fire them with largely no risk to their profit margin. These are great ideas, I believe, for France, but it quickly went horribly wrong. 


First of all, the prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, attempted to pass the CPE under aberrational political procedure—“under the radar”—if you will. It did not help that he had presidential asperations as well, since the French Election cycle was gearing up the timing of the legislation looked awful. To make a long story short, when students got wind of this plan, they viewed it as exploitative, as taking something that they were entitled to away, and contrary to their self-interests. And so they hit the streets in awesome effect. Eventually the spineless Jacques Chiraque had to go on national television, where he uttered the curiously contradictory phrase, “I’m going to promogulate this law, but I’m asking the assembly to ignore it.”—What? Needless to say, Villepin’s political aspirations went down in flames along with his CPE.



Now then, is it fair to compare the failures of OWS with the successes of the student-led strike? 

1. One argument that I hear is that striking isn’t geographically as feasible in the U.S. as it is in France. For one, France’s economic and political center are the same-Paris. I don’t think this holds much weight as NYC is supremely concentrated.


2.  The French are much more tolerant of protestors than the U.S. At the end of my piece I will explain why I believe this is because the French are much more class-conscious than the Americans. As such, the consequences of being arrested for obstruction of justice during a strike or protest in France are much less dire to someone aspiring to find a decent job than catching a charge is for a student in America—which in some cases can be economic suicide especially if you are a minority or are non-privileged. In France you can make the argument that a charge such as this is culturally-engrained as a badge of honor or a rite of passage for students. 


3. Unions are much stronger in France and the students were directly supported by two large labor unions and a transportation union if my memory is correct. So much so that these unions were prepared to strike in solidarity with the students. If I remember correctly the metros were shut down for a couple of days and one does not shut down metros without the help of the transportation union. 


4. While French students occupied major streets, and subway stations, they also refused to go to schools and discouraged foreign students and the disinclined to enter the schools. This is a completely alien concept to Americans-myself included, but I’m going to argue that it serves a demonstrable purpose.


5. They were striking in response to a particular legislative action, the CPE. The fact that Villepin thought he could pass the law under the radar helped bolster public opinion in favor of the students. So the strike had a focused demand—the rejection of the CPE and for Villepin’s head.


6. The French students were highly organized. I argue that this is because it was a student-led protest/strike, and so the giant schools of Paris served to organize the protestors into specific units-which clearly helped them effectively shut down different parts of public transportation in Paris at the same time. They were also highly savvy protestors—keen to help riot police apprehend protestors who wanted to break things or to use the protests as an excuse to incite violence. 


7. In OWS, I am unaware of any large-scale school-oriented organization of protests. I am also unsure it is even fair to classify OWS as a student protest, as pictures of Zucotti Park occupiers indicate a more diverse social strata. 


8. I am unaware of any labor unions that were in communication with OWS—definitely none were prepared to strike in solidarity with OWS. I am not sure that public transportation employees are unionized in NYC. 


9. OWS was not a response to a specific piece of legislation that was passed using spurious procedure. The argument can be made that it was a reaction to the Dodd-Frank act and its failure to effectively reform the financial system and punish bankers, but this wasn’t explicit as it was with the French. 


10. Because OWS was not student-oriented per se, the protesters themselves were not “giving up” anything but their time—which exposes them to a lot of criticism—rightfully so. In Paris, the students were refusing to go to school and be educated—they were acting directly contrary to their own self-interests in the hope that they could achieve/preserve long-term goals. The fact that they were willing to “give something up” demonstrated that they were taking this seriously. 


11. In France, the locus of the strike was also different. Most of the financial institutions in Paris are located around La Defense, not in Paris proper. The strike was aimed at clogging the giant boulevards and shutting down high-traffic metro stations. This affected normal French who didn’t necessarily have a vested interest in the CPE—this got in everyone’s faces—not just the villains of the strike, Villepin’s supporters. 


12. Whereas in OWS the protest left transportation in NYC largely undisturbed save for a few nights, and thus out of sight and out of mind of the majority of everyday New Yorkers who don’t pass by Zuccotti Park on their way to work.  Here is where I give Jay and the bankers the most credit for their criticisms. Why would anyone pay attention to your grievances and agenda when you are unable to sustain pain in order to inflict pain on others? OWS members are heretofore not willing to endure any of the painful realities of protest/strike, and so Jay is right to criticize the whole ordeal as nothing more than fanciful behavior with no backbone. 


While I criticize OWS for lack of a specific target, for the wrong locus of protest, and for the lack of student oriented, school-specific organization, I believe OWS’s failures to date are more about a lack of class consciousness than anything else. And unfortunately class-consciousness isn’t something we can attain by simply “teaching class-consciousness to the masses”—rightly lambasted as generally spineless guitar circles and kumbaya love fests. No, class-consciousness is something that must be achieved through a reactionary crisis.


Indeed, as ludicrous as this sounds, Parisians first learned these lessons during the French Revolution, which moreso than ours, was about class rather than dominance by a country far removed. The French learned the lessons of class exploitation during the Revolution, and I argue that strikes and protests are much more culturally engrained and therefor successful because of this. 


So I say let’s wait and see. Maybe we’re learning things from OWS, but I’m not holding my breath. As bad as things are for your average American worker or student, it seems they are not bad enough for said NYC student to absorb a misdemeanor charge for clogging avenues or stopping metro trains. Obviously I’m giving the NYPD the benefit of a doubt as to their civility and judicial restraint here. Let’s see what happens when the price of bread starts to rise.

*is comfortable dealing with clients
*is up for an adventure.  

Compensation is round-trip air transportation to Vilnius from New York, room (shared apartment with other interns), board, and a local-level salary for your stay.

Loads of bars/restaurants and things to do nearby. Management of the team in Lithuania is American, and the working language is English. Our work culture is incredibly informal. We do not require set work hours, a dress code, etc.  

Start date is flexible, and we need you to commit for three months. If you want to stay until Christmas, that would be great. Every member intern we've ever had has accepted full-time positions with us to work in our offices across Europe.

The burgular also took my laptop (also quite sensitive documents), my iphone, and all of the money in our wallets combined (about $115). Both of our bank accounts are totally empty right now.  She is absolutely devasted and is even toying with the idea break up, but nothing decided yet.  I'm soooo worried :(

Here's my story, about a year ago I did an Internship in the United States. I worked for the Dutch goverment as a researcher/coffee boy. Since it was for goverment related they issued me an A-2 Visa (Visas for Diplomats and Foreign Government Officials) which allowed me to travel to the States for 6 months. Now I am done with my studies and before I set up my own business I really would like to visit the States again for another 6 months. I have about 30k on my savings account and have a couple friends who offered me a place to sleep.

So I have some extra money, I have if needed additional places where I can spend the night and I have no intentions of kidnapping Obama or any kind of terrorist activity.

That aside, We talk about marriage and we are both 100% committed (not as ready as counseled couples, but we are not at that step yet.) The only catch is that we're both in college.

Just as I do for my clients, I strongly recommend all with diet questions or big goals to work with a dietitian to achieve weight loss/muscle gain goals. Not only are they concerned with looks, they also want to make sure your body and its organs perform their best. They think long term as well as short term in relation to your goals and their results. Within the United States, these men and women receive training and schooling for a minimum of four years as well as go through an on-the-job internship and need certain certifications to deserve the title of registered dietitian. And just like a certified personal trainer and other occupations, they must take continuing education courses to maintain their registration.

All of us out here on the internet can give advice based on what we see typed out, but an in-person session with a dietitian allows that person to identify your needs, goals, and where you are right now on that journey to better health and keep you on track with weekly sessions just as a personal trainer does with your workout routines by watching your strengths and weaknesses. They will help expand your ideas of what is healthy for your body and tailor their regimens to what you want out of your intake."

I'm in Computer Science and I'm looking from some life advice from you guys, I strongly need it.

Currently, I have a CEGEP DEC in Management Information Systems (Mostly about building IT systems, Done 2 internships as well). As a result of that, Concordia credited me 4 classes, which are: Object Oriented Programming I and II, System Hardware, and Statistics Math. I'm stuck in a situation where I have to take a bunch of generic I don't really want because I need at least 4 classes to get my loans/grants. I'm sort of getting bored over this, because I'm not going to have anything programming/production related for a whole year because I need to do Math for Computer Science and the ENCS writing class before doing anything.

I'm pondering what I should do about this. I've been thinking of looking into foreign study programs because I'd like to go study in the United States at some point, and maybe move to the American east coast eventually. Now, that's the other problem, I'm currently in the Computer Games option, and looking at the state of the games industry right now sort of scares me, and I'd like to immigrate to the US after a bachelor or a masters, I'm thinking of changing options, but I don't know what to pick or who to ask advice from on the matter.

I do have my own projects, and I'm currently okay with my finances, but I'd like to get involved somewhere where I can further my skills or put my skills to use, I've done the conception of a few IT systems while in cegep, the cegep also hired me for a contract after I finished in June to build an online system for a department in the cegep. I'm wondering if the university itself offers any possibility for students to help with research in the faculty of computer science, or if there's a possibility for me getting a part-time job somewhere, pocket money wouldn't hurt.

Another thing I'm pondering about is what I'm supposed to do to study, I'm not sure how to take notes during a lecture, and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to study. I usually go over the material covered in class, do exercises if applicable, and try to understand the material.

Anyone can help me with these issues?"

I'm 25 and I've been to 15 countries. I spent the most time in Africa (4-5 years ago). However, I did not work there, nor was I volunteering, nor was I on a mission trip. I was simply there to explore a beautiful part of the world I'd never seen- alone. I often stayed with locals that I'd met at the market that day, for instance. That's how I wanted it.  (not safe as a 20yr old blonde white girl)

Anyway, how do I make any of this help me out on paper?"

How long is too long for a paid internship?,BradburyMan,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zor5c/my_wifes_going_on_a_three_year_internship_now_how/,"My wife has been interning in the planning department of our local city hall for almost three years, and she's starting to become leery of being taken advantage of. She's also starting to wonder if interning for this long of a period will back fire on her; this might result in potential employers asking her why she wasn't hired on after years of working with the same team.


Can any interns give their accounts as to how their long internship affected their job prospects?


Can any employers give their input as to how they would react to such a long internship on an applicant's resume? Do you really consider the quality of work from an intern to be on par with their respective job duties for that amount of time?"

My current boyfriend is everything I've ever wanted in a guy and more and a senior in engineering at the same school. The very moment I met him (online) we clicked and are both democrats and atheists. We have late night talks on quantum physics and he has helped me kill a lot of the demons of my past. He treats me really well and gave me flowers and running supplies for my birthday (I'm an avid runner). Never forces me into anything, waited a good two months just to have sex. He supports me in everything and over the summer I supported him a lot through his summer internship. We've been ""involved"" for six months, seriously dating for four. 
My dreams used to be pretty much solely getting a job at Google and/or a beach house but now those are mixed with marrying him/getting pregnant.. which freaks me out to no end. I'm not ready for these urges :( Especially since he already has a career and I'm just starting out.

I'm applying for my school's investment club, but since internship recruitment is ramping up starting next week, I would like to be ready knowing what I should be targeting. There's lots of investment banks, consulting firms coming, as well as several companies offering marketing jobs, a few private equity, but no hedge funds.

zojpx,2,2012-09-10,[Critique] Do I have any plot development skill?,MPC45000,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/zojpx/critique_do_i_have_any_plot_development_skill/,"I submitted some stuff yesterday and the 5 people who responded all seemed to agree I was terrible at writing. My real question is what about plot development? Ignore writing, ignore fact checking (So apparently Minnesota doesn't have any mountains, my fucking bad.) I want to know if I have plot development. I want to more or less write a TV show, a collaborative project, and I want to be able to develop plots, not so much have words being read. So here's the first bit I wrote yesterday plus an ending. There is no middle, but I'll add important details about the middle at the end.



DAY 1

The morning air had certain crispness to it. Crispness only the wilderness of Minnesota
could provide. I remember that much. The rest of the day’s events were not so clear, but I have a
general idea of what I had done. Some recent studies have shown that a good way for patients
with head trauma to recall recent events is to attempt to journal it. I didn’t buy it, but I had no
better options. When I first was diagnosed, with amnesia, I could barely remember my name.
Someone would say “How are you feeling Kyle?” and my response would be “Who the fuck is
Kyle?” It was rough, and I had to find out what had happened to me.
What was worse, it wasn't amnesia, but I could barely remember what happened to me Monday through Friday.



 It was mid-October, the
time of the year camping isn’t something you see everyone doing for weekend fun. But I had no
qualms about camping in the cold by myself. I had been camping plenty of times before, and had absolutely no worries about this time.
I don't know why I’m journaling as if I’m talking to somebody but it seems to let me let my thoughts flow a
little better than if I was writing any other way. Regardless, Saturday morning I left heading
north, away from my apartment in Fargo towards the Canadian border. I didn’t know where I
was going but I knew I had to go a long way. I had just gone through some life changing events.
I needed a weekend to myself. I packed only the necessities, a tent, a couple gallons of water, 2
pounds of beef jerky, and some soup I could throw in a pot of water over a fire. I also brought my camera, a Nikon D4 SLR. I
spent six thousand dollars on a camera for a job I spent a week in before the photography
company, Wildlife Minnesota, went bankrupt and had to fire everyone. I was out a lot of money.
8 months later, and I still can’t find a job. 



After 8 or so hours of driving, I decided to pull onto a
trail off the road and head until I found another road or a clearing to set up camp. About a half
mile down the path, a found a clearing about 20 feet on each side, and I decided to set up, seeing
it was getting dark. Now that I think about it, it seemed unusually dark for 4 in the afternoon,
even for October. I got out of my beat up old car, which smelled of piss and a lemon air
freshener, into the much better smelling environment of the wilderness. The fresh air was a relief and the recognizable smell of pine trees comforted me. There was no place as serene as a secluded forest which was the only place that had this kind
of atmosphere, and I loved every second of it. Growing up in St. Paul and then living in Fargo
was tough for me, seeing as I always loved the outdoors. I know it was dangerous to set up camp
in an unsanctioned area not knowing the nearest town. I doubted I could have reached the
Canadian border, but I couldn’t be sure if I had or not. I came out here for two reasons: One was
to spend some time alone to think about life, the other was to maybe get a picture good enough
to sell so I could maybe have a comfortable life as opposed to struggling more than I would enjoy.  Maybe, just maybe, some big magazine would buy my picture and
jumpstart my career as a photojournalist. 



I set up camp pretty quickly and set up a fire with some
firewood I brought. I knew how to create a fire like a true mountain man, but I decided to use
some fire starter liquid I bought for this exact occasion. I threw a match into the log formation, and I had a fire going. I didn’t want to attract any bears or other dangerous creatures, so I cooked
some soup in about 30 minutes and put out the fire, effectively wasting a gallon of water
between the soup water and making sure I didn't set the forest ablaze. I went inside
my tent and ate my soup with the light of only a small lantern about the size of my palm. The
soup, as expected, tasted like sewer water mixed with freshly picked garden rocks, but that was
part of the camping experience. The little light and bad food immersed me in the experience. I
went to sleep with the feeling tomorrow was going to be a very good day. I couldn't have been more wrong.

Day 8

Today is my second day in the hospital, and I’m writing this on the day it is
happening, as opposed to the recounts I did yesterday. I remember my name now. I think.
I didn’t recollect the full story. Also, I know you’re reading this Dr. MacEachern. That’s what
psychiatrists do, make sure their patients are mentally unstable. That’s okay, but I feel like I have
to tell you the rest of the story. The reason I went camping, I went camping… I went camping because of a life changing event Friday, the day before I left. So there was this
girl, Caroline. 

This girl's name was Caroline April Grace, and we had been dating for almost 8 years, since my sophomore year of high school. Friday, she came to my apartment to see me one last time before she left for
Boston for 6 months for an internship at a major magazine there. She was a journalist, and we made
the perfect team. I took pictures and she wrote about them. 



It was 6 o’clock and she wanted to go to her parents’ house for an hour
before she went home to sleep before her 4 am flight. Why she wanted to fly out at 4 was a
mystery to me, and maybe if it was a later flight, things would have been different. As she was
about to leave, I grabbed her arm. I had spent the last 10 hours working on what to say. I looked
her straight in the eyes and said to her, “Caroline, in the grand scheme of things, we're not here
for long. Not by a longshot. And what little time we do have will have its ups and downs, it's
highs and lows, great wins and heartbreaking losses, but through it all, the only thing I could ask
for is to spend that time with someone who will be there through it all, someone who I truly don't
deserve, someone who redefines the word breathtaking. You.” She looked back at me,
dumbfounded. I pulled out a ring, got down on one knee, and
said, “Caroline, will you marry me?” Her response stayed with me for a long time. I don’t
know. I have to go. I’ll call you when I land in Boston tomorrow.” That was when she left for
the last time. I would never see her again. 


I got a call from her parents 3 hours later. She had
been in a car accident they said, an eighteen wheeler had run a red light, and speared her car. She
was in critical condition in the hospital. I hung up before that conversation finished. I ran to my
car in my underwear, sweating like never before, and drove as fast as I could to the hospital.
When I got there, I ran through the emergency room waiting room causing a string of gasps,
people in disbelief I was half naked in a hospital. I ran up the stars to the third floor. Room 327. I
ran into the room as the nurse pulled the sheets over her limp body. I heard the attending as he
said “Time of death, 9:43.” That was the last thing I heard before I collapsed to the floor in
disbelief, and sank into a euphoria in which my vision became a blur and all I heard was a sort of
white noise. I didn’t move for almost an hour. Finally, at around 11 o'clock, I was able to get up. I
ran home. I had my friend David pick up my car and bring it to me. I immediately packed up for
my camping trip. I headed out at 8 in the morning, with maybe an hour of sleep in that time. The
spot I went to, it wasn’t random. Caroline said she found a pond with a waterfall pouring down
into a cave. She said she drank the water, and it was amazing. Said it gave her a great rush that she couldn't describe, sans the fact she had never felt so alive. I don’t know what caused me to
go there to try to forget about her, at least for a bit, but I did go there. I didn’t forget about her. I
choose the wrong way to deal with my problems. Hold up. I might lose my train of thought
before I get back, I have a visitor and I have to put down the pen for a second. Who would want

to visit me at 11:45 at night? Better yet, why would they allow someone to visit at 11:45. The
nurse looks worried.

Day 9

Hello Kyle. I came back for you. I decided I needed someone to spend eternity with, and
I found the perfect person. You.

-

Caroline

&gt; The journal of Kyle Even was found in Room 327 in the county hospital of Fargo, Minnesota,
after the police were called by a concerned staff member. Upon arrival, the police found the
walls of the hospital smeared with blood. No one was present at the scene. There were no survivors found.


Plot points: Day 2: Wakes up to find supplies missing. Car stolen. Goes searching for car/water.
 Finds car in late afternoon near pond in last part. Drinks water. Feels euphoria rush, sky turns deep purple at 3 in the afternoon. Drive down road towards home. Car breaks down, walks about half mile to outskirts of town. Freemont, population 327. Goes looking for help at gas station. No one there. Knocks on door of person next to gas station, no answer. Diner has light on. Go in. No one there. Go into diner kitchen. See no one. Hear sound. Turn around. BAM! Intense pain, blackout. Absolutely no recollection of days 3-6, wakes up Day 7 in hospital in Fargo. Commence next part of what I wrote.


Yes, the pond was the ""Devil's pond"" or some sort of demon thing. 

Sorry if the filler notes are a little sporadic and badly written, I just kind of filled in what I wrote in my plot outline notes.

Again, this is more about plot development, less about writing skill/style.

Also, where did I write about mountains? Someone yelled at me last time about there being no mountains in Minnesota, but I don't know where I mentioned them."

I'm currently studying Germanics and Management Information Systems (Wirtschaftsinformatik) at a decent public university in the United States.  I am a German/American dual citizen and have lived in Germany roughly two years of my life - including three months in Munich at the Goethe Institut there, where I learned at the C1/C2 language levels.

My goal with all of this is to move to Germany when I'm done with college.  I've always liked being there more than the United States, and it's somehow always felt like home to me, and more like ""my"" culture.

How difficult would it be for me to find an internship there next summer, between my Junior and Senior years?  My school is on the west coast and doesn't have many people doing dual degrees like me with the intent to move overseas, so it's hard to tell what's available or where to even look.  I have relatives who live in Bavaria (Erlangen and Ingolstadt), so I'm somewhat biased to the south - but if I could get an internship anywhere I'd love it. Does anyone have pointers on how to begin that process?

Also, how difficult will it be for me to eventually move there?  Obviously with my citizenship that's no problem; my hope is that Information Systems is something useful there and that I can find work (in any of the DACH-Länder, really). And it seems like me doing an internship there this summer would also be instrumental in being able to find work the year after, when I'm finishing my bachelor work.

So, any suggestions? Anyone do what I'm trying to do, or have any suggestions? I just came across this subreddit recently and haven't yet seen any similar stories."

I had a surgery consultation for the cyst, the doctor said I'd go home the same day and it'd only take a week to heal. 
I figured I'd rather miss one week of school and just make up my work rather than wait until October when I graduate and miss out financially working full time, and also it was just very painful and embarrassing living day-to-day with it. So I said yes, let's do surgery. I had that performed 8 days ago and since then there has been 0 progress to my recovery. I still cannot sit for more than a minute, I can't drive, and it kills me to lay down / get up. Did some searching online and I found out its not uncommon for this procedure to take up to a month or longer to heal. I absolutely CANNOT afford to miss any more class time else I will fail, but I physically cannot get there nor do my work. CompSci student so everything is on a desktop PC, I don't own a laptop and am posting this from my phone. My school professors / dept. chair hasn't been very helpful.

* Normally, with my formatting, it's under a page

* Ignore the black border on the Table. I use it to format the resume, but I normally make it invisible, so it doesn't appear on the actual resume. If you want to see what it looks like without it, just change the Table Properties so that the border is white. 

* One of the jobs on there is from high school. I have had a job in between that one and the marketing internship, but it was delivering pizza at Domino's, so I left it out. I should probably take out the high school one, but there were parts of it that I thought were useful (in particular because one of the companies I'm applying to works with kids). 

Now, I sort of like the format I have, but on the other hand I'm thinking it may be a bit too plain and boring. Do you guys have some good ideas for different ways I can format it? 

Also, since I'm in Marketing, I feel like I could be more creative with it (color/format stuff). Problem is, I have a hard time figuring out the line between being creative and being unprofessional. \

Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks!"

My strength has increased steadily, but unfortunately for me all the fat went to my belly and boobs. Which is causing some troubles. I really want to get it all away before I start playing soccer again (which is in three weeks).

The last week I'm steady at 80kg, eating something along the lines of this everyday:
10 slices of bread w/ meat between
2 proteinshakes, 1 w/ water and 1 w/ milk
Dinner (mostly pasta or potatoes, or bread)
Some fruit

I'm also busy with my intern ship where I sit behind the computer all day, so not much exercise there. I'm more than willing to go running for three days a week, will this help?

Also, perhaps a stupid question, but when you want to cut fat, I assume that the hunger feeling is included there? Today I ate just two slices of bread, dinner and some fruit and I felt like shit. Is this the way to go to cut off fat? And can I get the 5kg off in 3 weeks?"

I graduate in May with my B.B.A in Computer Information Systems. More technical than MIS, but not near as technical CS. 

I have enjoyed programming in my classes and would like to continue to program as my career. I fear I do not have the experience that most graduates will have and that will cause problems with my career outlook. 

Languages:

* VB.NET - Proficient (Used for Desktop/Web/Mobile development in class)
* HTML/CSS - Well
* PHP - Some
* SQL - Well
* BASH - Some

I would like to get into mobile/backend web programming (at least I think I do). What am I missing from what language types I've learned?

I've been ""learning"" Python, but it seems nothing more than the syntax.
_____________________________________________________________________
Resume overview:

Pursuing BBA – Computer Information Systems, May 2013 - 3.2 GPA


VB.Net Programming | WP 7 Programming | SQL Database 

* Summer internship - Fortune 10 company - Worked on scripting project
* ~2yrs of phone technical support
* President of CIS Student Organization, was VP who handled website 
* MTA in Database Design 

Our organization is part of a national organization that puts on regional and national conference. These include contests. I took home 1st in the Application Development and 3rd in Database Design. 

_____________________________________________________________________

Next Question

I have a full time offer from the internship with a great starting salary/benefits. It wouldn't be guaranteed programming, but I could choose to have a technical career there. I'm looking at other opportunities in different cities within my state, so how should I, if possible, use my current offer to my advantage?

How is my resume looking as far as a candidate for software development?


Thanks!

I am interested in web development with Python and Django.

I have good reason to believe that I have the potential to become an excellent developer, but I have little means to prove it at present. I imagine that in an ideal world I would have a GitHub full of completed personal projects to show off, but having Asperger's syndrome makes it hard for me to motivate myself to invent and complete a project in an unstructured environment. The same traits that hinder me when trying to code in my spare time will prove desirable to an employer, such as my desire to work under pressure.

What I would love would be for a London employer to ""adopt"" me by giving me a reasonably structured project to complete for them for free in order to demonstrate my potential, with a look to subsequently being offered an internship (though if that weren't possible I'd still be happy for the boost that the project would provide to my CV).

If any representative of a London employer is reading this (I figure you must be pretty open-minded anyway if you're browsing this part of Reddit), then please consider sending me a PM to talk about this. I am eager to realise my potential with you."

I thought I did everything right. I graduated high school, went to college, graduated my undergrad with a 3.8. Went to grad school, got a 4.0. During that time, I had 7 internships. I networked, I attended professional events, I stayed in touch with contacts. I worked at McDonalds during all of it, for almost 10 years to pay my bills (from age 14-24).

After I graduated this past may I have worked every single lead, contact that I can think of. I've asked friend's moms, old bosses, old co workers, random people in the grocery line, friends of friends and it just seems so dismal.

I feel like I worked so long, worked so many unpaid internships, went into $110,000 of debt, for it to pay off eventually-- and it's not paying off. I can't pay for even a pack of gum. I already have to default on my first student loan (it was parent plus loan, so since my parents are employed I was no longer permitted to defer it in July and had to default, impacting my dad's credit). My own loans come in November.

I just feel like such a waste of a person. Everyone I know personally has an apartment and a job, and an income. I can't even find work part time. I live at home and my parents have to pay my car insurance, my gas, everything (which I eventually have to pay back, but I digress). I feel like I'm 10 years old, and I'm treated like it. Friends foolishly envy me, complimenting that my parents pay my bills and that I get to sit home all day and do nothing. They have no idea how it feels to get rejection letter after rejection letter, go to job fairs and be 45th in a line of people trying to hand a resume off and pray someone reads it.

I tailor every resume, spend 1-2 hours crafting 'the perfect cover letter.' Interviewee's have complimented my cover letter. I have had two interviews since May, both of which declined me citing that I was overqualified. 

I understand others have been unemployed for longer and 4 months seems like nothing, but I'm really down tonight. I just don't know how many applications more I can send, how many more networking events I can attend, how much more I can take. I would gladly move ANYWHERE in the US for a job and I obviously, and perhaps rightfully so haven't been contacted by anyone outside of my local area. 

I just feel like a lame loser, 25 years old, living with mommy and daddy paying my bills. Friends with associates degrees found jobs within a week of graduating and I can't find ANYTHING to save my life. Since May I've applied for 234 jobs, all with custom cover letters and resumes. I have been CONSUMED since April, applying to at least 3 jobs a day and NEVER, EVER have I used the same cover letter for ANY OF THEM. I'm trying so hard and I feel like a giant piece of shit.

Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get it out there.

A woman boarded the bus and sat in a seat close to where I was standing. She looked around her 40's-50's and I noticed she was giving me some frequent glances and stares, but I didn't take much account into it. It was not until she was about to switch seats when she walks by me and shoves two one-dollar bills in hand.

I froze and made a confused face as the woman sat back down, indifferent to the event that had just transpired.

I cautiously and nervously approach her saying things like, ""uh, excuse me?"" ""Miss?""

No response.

I tried speaking spanish to her, as she looked indigenous, ""Perdoname?""

She turned around, glanced at the money, and started rejecting what ever I was going to say or propose to her, without allowing me to begin.

But she then says, broken and muffled, ""Shoo tal. Mi shun.""

I was still curious and tried to speak as clear and slow as possible, my spanish not being as fluent as I had hoped. ""I-don't-want-to take-your money...""

She kept repeating what she said before with her previous gestures, but being more coherent with her words as she spoke.

""Ju tall. My jun. No englis pleas...""

As I was about to plead some more, nearly grasping a faint idea of what she was insinuating, somebody sitting behind me interjects,

""I think she is talking about her son. You look tall like him and you remind her of him. He probably died or is somewhere else and she wants to thank you for reminding her of him, by giving you her money.""

Ow. My heart sank, taking with it my eye-lids and mouth as a result. She sighed, made eye contact, and spoke in the loudest soft voice I've ever heard.

""Your-tall. Like my son.""

I held a blank stare directed behind the woman, as I was looking through her and not at her. I was conflicted in terms of what I wanted to say, but I knew what had just occurred. I just didn't know what do to at that exact moment.

I missed my stop. Then the next one. Then I finally got off. Then I did the thing that I felt like I needed to do when I was on the bus. Or maybe is was plainly out of impulse.

I cried. I felt aimless, worthless, and touched. I thought about how this lady probably didn't own a lot of money, yet she was willing to give me her two dollars because I reminded her of her son.

I wasn't sure if I should be worthy enough to be her son. I felt wrong and misplaced inside; As if anyone should come as close to consider me as one of their cherished ones.

But, I think I made her happy, and that's all that counts.

Have you had any experiences like this?"

[Greg ""Opie"" Hughes](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Opie) AKA ""Opie the Destroyer""- The other half of the Duo. Father with another on the way, he is the more radio savvy host. Many hate him for his complaining about the industry. But he serves a pivotal role on the show.



[Jim ""Yimmy"" Norton-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Jimmy) Stand up comic and lovable third wheel. This Tranny loving mush brings many characters to the show such as Chip Chipperson and Paul Hargis the pedophile old man.


[Primetime Sam Roberts-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Primetime_Sam_Roberts) Corporate good guy and cheapskate. He remains one of the few people working at XM that are good at their job. When opie and anthony are gone and dead, this man will rise and wear the XM radio crown. This much he is destined for.


[DJ Troy Quan-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Troy_Quan) You know that guys that is WAY too old to be living the clubbing lifestyle, drinking, partying out and fucking all the ladies, but does it any way? That's Troy Quan in a nutshell.


[Danny Ross-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Danny) My personal favorite guy working with Opie and Anthony. He is a heavy drinker, porn lover, flesh light duel-wielding fella. He is a frequent drinking buddy for Anthony Cumia. He is superior to Sam Roberts when it comes to finding pictures and videos for O&amp;A to talk about, but sadly works more in technical and production. He occasionally comes around.


[Eric ""EROCK"" Nagel](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Erock) AKA Sex Bagel, AKA Hawk, AKA Hogey Boy, AKA Lazy- This self destructive but lovable oaf is a Senior producer for O&amp;A. He is also the ass of every joke under the son as he ""Is a fat lazy mess"" Not much to say, but I pity the man.


[Travis](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Travis) AKA ""Doctor Gay""- Travis is a former intern and now permanent staff member of The Opie and Anthony Show. He often makes homosexual statements in various show promos and is goofed on for being a little too feminine in nature. That was copied from the wiki... as I could not come up with much to say about him myself. He is consistent, and helpful. I'd be sad if he died in a car crash. His wife is also gorgeous... why can't I find one like that.

[Club Soda Kenny](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Club_Soda_Kenny)- Ex-cop and current security for O&amp;A. He is a big man, who is very set in his way of doing things. He wears vomit colored suits and looks like he has a tiny doberman head.

For what it's worth I've been very hesitant to ask for advice in the past since i've usually been met with ridicule and mockery. I'll try to be breif with my situation 

**Brief Synopsis:** I have an accounting/finace degree from a university where I graduated with average grades (3.2 gpa). While at school I completed an internship as a fianancial analyst and was an accounting liaison for a small business advisory group (student run organization, but basically I was doing the accounting for a start up business). After graduating I worked for 6 months at a fortune 500 insurance company as a financial analyst, it was a good experience and I was a contracted employee. Other than that my degree hasn't gotten much use. 


**what I'm looking for:** I'm not looking to get my cpa and i'm definitely not looking to work for the big 4 or anything. I realize they're way out of my league. I don't really have high expectations, all I really want is a job that is related to accounting or finance, really anything even vaguely connected. I want to put my degree to use. I really didn't mind my work as an analyst and i'd be fine doing something similar (data entry perhaps). I just want to build my resume and get my foot in the door somewhere doing something.

**what I need help with:** basically I want to know what i'm qualified for and what I should be doing to better my chances of getting hired (I know i'm not the bell of the ball in terms of candidates, even just looking on this subreddit has made me feel pretty low on the totem pole). I'm with a bunch of temp agencies and I try to apply to at least 20 places a week, but that varies. My networking skills aren't great, admittedly, and i'm a pretty bland interviewee but i'm working on it. My resume is fine and it's been revamped many times but i'd be more than happy to PM it to someone if they wanted to look at it. 

Any help at all would be much appreciated and I can spare some more details if need be. I hope this wasn't too long to read. I really appreciate any responses and most of all your time. Thanks! "

He started out his sophomore year with nothing but a cheap camcorder, limited knowledge, and embarrassingly low rates. As a matter of fact, he only charged $150 for his first few videos! 

Here's the catch: those videos were made for a song-writer and producer who's a major player in the country music business, his wife who just got signed to a major Christian label, and a song-writer for a few famous names that just opened his own publishing company. 

This led him to a point where he landed among some of the greats, and he went on to spend his summer as an ""intern"" at a record label in exchange for the chance to produce videos with some major artists (which he actually listens to on a regular basis). Granted, this wasn't all he earned – he got a full three-hour credit and marvelous resume material as well.

Time went on that summer, and he began charging $500 per video. During this time, he got a chance to work with one of the industry's best stylists and an artist from The Voice. Now he's a junior, and he's set to shoot an artist from Sony next week. He also just got done producing an $8000 music video for a country artist, and even though that is low-budget in the big picture, it's still pretty awesome.

He discovered that in the grand scheme, $500 per video doesn't cut it. 20% of it goes to his yearly business expenses... 30% of what's left needs to go to taxes... In the end, he would be left with very little per video.

Worst of all, he's not getting a ton of work yet. However, his name is getting out there, and he's already got a few good gigs under his belt. He's at a point where he can hire if the money is available, so just bear in mind that this isn't the typical college scenario where he makes about $50 for shooting a video of his friend's band...  

Most individuals his age only work as PAs with these kinds of artists. In his case, he's producing and directing them at age 20. (Well, he turns 21 in about an hour.) It's a wonderful opportunity, but yes, he's aware that he's being slightly taken advantage of.

However, he's stuck in this situation: he doesn't charge hourly for his editing, his flat rate isn't enough to live on right now, and he knows that artists realistically do not have the budget to spend on sporadic video content like he offers. (After working at a record label, he saw the actual budget for some things.)

He plans on starting an LLC in the next two months, but his future looks bleak since there is not super consistent work right now. That's maybe two to three big projects a month, so that's only $700ish income for a month. If he raises his rates, he may lose the bigger name clients. If he keeps his rates like they are, he will be taking a huge risk. If things go well, he graduates with a harem of even bigger clients under his belt that are willing to pay more. If things go bad, he graduates with a few cool things to his name, semi-consistent work, but a low income.

With that said, I'm tired of referring to myself in the third person. I'd really like to raise my rates, but I don't know if I should while I'm at this stage. What would you do in my situation (age 20, naïve, and apprehensive about everything)?

By the way, I've no longer got the cheap camcorder... Up to a Canon 60D, Canon T4i, and a Panasonic AC130. Woo-hoo.

As a note, I'm aware that I am no-where near where I would like to be as far as talent and technical knowledge goes. I learn from whoever I can however I can. Most of my peers know more than me. I just may have found myself in a decent situation.

A lot of this also stems from the ignorance of how video rates work. Not mine. Mostly clients."
zr01i,3,2012-09-12,Another Question About Careers in Geology,maxbastard,geology,https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/zr01i/another_question_about_careers_in_geology/,"I know /r/geology has by-and-large become a hub for ""How Do I Find a Job?"" posts lately, with the starting of new a new Fall semester. And though it may have sounded crass to some, [loolwat had a point](http://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/zn47u/q_ph_levels_in_relation_to_sulfate/c665col)...

But I hear a lot of people complaining about the job market in the Geosciences, though [rigzone.com](http://rigzone.com/jobs/) and [indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=geoscience&amp;l=) show an abundance of jobs. I myself live in East Texas, and know landmen, roughnecks (sometimes, unfortunately), etc. who look confused at the news of a lack of Geoscience-related careers.

My Question Is: Is it *at all* a ""tough time"" in the field right now? Or are people just not using the tools (student associations, internships... **relocation**) available to them to find work?

I'm just starting out, as a ""mature student"" (past my late 20s in Texas) and only have a couple of semesters under my belt. I have a family already and would prefer not to be gone half of my young daughter's life. My university (SFASU) offers a BS in Spatial Science (with a specialization in Natural Resource Management) and I have yet to decide on my major-- GIS with a Geology minor, or vice-versa? Which would be more flexible, have a higher mean income, and provide me with more stability, long-term?

I'm not looking for a quick answer, I'd rather open up a decent discussion on the subject. I plan on taking advantage of anything I can to secure myself a decent career; I already have some opportunities available, though I've barely taken any classes. As I've mentioned, I'm still trying to make the best decision before taking the plunge. I've even broached the subject with some of my professors, and they haven't yet had much to offer. I will, of course, speak more to my T.A.s and anyone else I can find on campus that might have a unique point of view.

I'll stop with the wall-o-text narrative, if I've missed anything, let me know...        and thanks in advance."

i am a 25 year old University of Virginia graduate who has lived and studied in the U.S since I was 16 years old. unfortunately for me, things never lined up and after 9 years of legal stay i still find myself without a route to calling this great land my permanent home. i do NOT want to be shipped off to pakistan under any circumstances because as a young westernized, educated and liberated woman, i am seriously scared to live there in a land that does not let me exercise my God given rights of life and liberty to choose to live as a free woman.

please help. what is the best way through which i can move to canada?

from the research i have done it seems like my two options are obtaining a study permit and enrolling in an academic program for two years so i can qualify for the experience class immigration program or be sponsored for employment by a canadian employer.

Ive been there a few times, but she has never been to the USA (We're from Mexico) so im thinking about a 3 day, 2 night visit, which would include a full day dedicated to shopping in Las Americas. Ideally it would go like this:
-Day 1 would be for shopping only.
-Day 2 im thinking San Diego Zoo (she loves animals AND the beach)
-Day 3 some more touring before returning to Tijuana for the bus back home (as late as possible so we can sleep on the road)

Im planning on the whole thing being a surprise, and im in a sort-of-paid internship right now, so I have about 500 dlls to spend. Im thinking about staying in cheap hotels, and making the trip about touring the city, rather than luxury (We'll do that some other time).

So far i have two main questions:
1.- Should i stay in a hotel near Las Americas, or near some other place deeper in San Diego, to make it more efficient touring-wise? Im planning on moving around in the trolley/buses. If your advice is some other place, i would love it if you included a suggestion!

2.- Which is better, San Diego Zoo or the Safari? Ive been trying to find the differences but i think the best way to find out is from locals!

3.- Suggest some places to visit on our 3rd and final day in your beautiful city! (Where to eat, what beach to visit, something else?)


Thank you very much for any input you might bring into my planning! Im very excited about this, because its gonna be her first time in your country and San Diego! (I know a day shopping is a wasted day, but its the main reason i convinced her to get a passport, so Ill have to manage)"

Basically, my friend (let's call him Steve) got an internship at a large company in Massachusetts because his dad works there. Steve eventually got hired full-time out of college and has been working there this summer in an entry-level position. 

Two weeks ago, the company was acquired and the entire executive team was laid off including Steve's dad. One week later, a higher-up from the acquiring company walked through the office and noticed that Steve had the same last name as one of the executives that was fired. He commented on Steve's nameplate saying ""is that [executive]'s son?"" right within earshot of his cubicle.

Today, Steve was told that he ""should probably leave"" by a member of HR because they're ""in an awkward transition."" He said no and was given a termination letter at the end of the day. Apparently his boss and even his boss's boss didn't know about it. It came straight from the top -- maybe even from the person who first saw the nameplate.

Steve doesn't live with his dad and was an entry-level number cruncher. His dad even decided to retire after this so Steve posed ZERO threat. Everything about this sounds like it was just an asshole power move.

This happened in Massachusetts. Are there laws to protect against this? Can they really fire someone only because they terminated his dad?

No idea how to approach this, really need input.",dreamsofastronomy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ztzz3/heading_into_long_distance_again_with_many/,"Hey everyone,

So my girlfriend and I have been togerther 1.5 years now. Out this 11 months were long distance where she was away on internships and travelling.
We´ve always had our problems in the past since the setup was really difficult to begin with. But we were both determined to pull through. She was in a different city for 6 months where I visited her every 2 weeks for long weekends. we talked on the phone everyday and got into small fights which eventually ended in us agreeing that the problem was that one thought he/she was more in love than the other. 
My family was often a problem in that i get along with her family really well but sort of shielded her from my family because my father is an egocentric alcoholic and my mother can be reall ydifficult although I hold a decent relationship with her.

From February until June my gf was home for almost 4 months. it took some adjusting but we ended up in a really good spot before she went to south america for 2.5 months. This is where things went really out of hand. At the airport she had cried her eyes out because she dreaded leaving me again and going onto the plane. I told her that I loved her and was sure she would have a great time. She was scared I was going to forget her or cheat (I have never ever given her any reason to believe this, have always been very faithful and loyal, justz talked too much about my ex the first 2 months which I stopped once we talked about how it annoyed her). When she went away to travel I was feeling really secure about our relationship and was just genuinely happy for her. While she was away I spent quite some time with friends and went on weekend trips. But I made sure to write her an email every day. We skyped twice but it was really difficult to understand her so I was not incredibly keen on doing that regularily. But I did enjoy seeing her. 

Things went okay for the first few weeks. Or so I thought. Messages with kisses and sweetly written. taling about missing each other and so forth.
however when she went on to Ecuador after one month things went bad. she stopped responding and just wrote 4 liners without any form of sincerity. Also there were pictures of here partying almost every night and in the arms of different guys. I got extremely sad and jealous and didnt know how to react. I didnt want to escalate into a fight so far away so I just really didnt say much, which I regret now.

Anyway she comes back 3 weeks ago and is a) really sick (coughing that turned into pneumonia) and b) very very distant and cold, harsh even.
She told me how she met all these inspirational people nad had so much fun time with them. I had just been here writing my masters thesis and didnt have much new to tell. Seh told how she met all these super muscular guys (I am somewhat skinny). she also mentioned how she had the feeling some of the people she met now knew her better than I do. She was also much more annoyed of me not being able to remember details of her stories or my clumsiness (has been an issue before and I´m trying to do better but its difficult). Eventually I had lost almost all of my self-esteem and security and cried many times in front of her. She said I am not as fascinating as I used to be and am pressuring her way too much and that it´s stressing her.
And I have been too quick to bring everything back to normal before even discussing what had really gone wrong.
She eventually even had to go to the hospital for a week. And I left her in peace due to her request for a few days. I did however send flowers and cupcakes to her which she really appreciated.


Eventually we had a big fight and talked about it all.
She said she missed me so incredibly much in the first weeks aways and thought i didnt care. Seh was also really disappointed that I didnt want to skype and said that many others she knew skyped with their SOs on daily basis. She also said that she was so pissedat me after one month that she just decided to go do her own thing and not care about it so much. Obviously showing me the cold shoulder.

and although some may think she might have cheated, I do not think so and didn´t ask. i do think she was quite attracted to some of the guys she met. i always try to make a point to leave her to her freedom and not become too jealous. But this was really upsetting. I feel betrayed but still dont think she cheated.

I told her I was really mad for her bahving so shitty towards me and she appologized. i agreed to talk about when something is bothering me. We were ok for 2 days and had good sex, cuddling and so forth. 

However we quickly got into a fight again when I was so ""unattentive"" and forgot to dispose the condom wrapper in her room before I left and her mom saw it  (how old are we?!). 
Arrgh she just gets annoyed at so many things I say. In my head i always think about what i say next so that she ownt make a snide remark.

She left this tuesday to go study in France (We live in germany) for 9 months. I made it super clear that I want to stay together and would come and see ehr 5 days a month (I have a really great well paying job which lets me allocate my holidays flexibly). I told her I still loved her very much. She however says she doesn´t understand why I only just now love her so much now and not earlier. She herself says she isn´t sure of her feelings towards me anymore at this point. Saying she had always said that I was her one big love and outshone anything before (true, she did say this often) and she was always disappointed that I couldn´t make this statement too (I have been in 2 3-year long relationships before and dont like comparing).

Anyway she is gone now. We are not seperated. But in a ways it feels that way. the last day was weird. In a way she showed affection in that she wanted to be hugged often. but then again she didnt want me to stay the night and thought it would have been better to say goodbye the day before. I ended up staying anyway and we hugged long in the morning and she didnt really want me to go and held on. I started crying again. ughh..

Well so she left. I have not been myself lately and realize that I couldnt have been very attractive in these past few weeks. I also despise how she treated me. I still love her very much and want us to return to normal state. I would still love to have a future together. But the way things are now i cant have a relationship with her.
We agreed that i would try to calm down and she would need some space to see how her emotions develop.

She texted me in the night when she arrived: ""arrived well.. Hope you are ok. Luckily there is no more time-difference :* "" (as in compared to south america... 

Now...  I have no fucking clue!! I love her and want to do this. But I have a stupid habbit of holding on to long and romanticising. I do believe in fairy-tales though as in love is not rational sometimes and I will do anything for the woman I love. I dont know how to approach this situation...  do I just leave her alone and let her contact me? Am I betraying myself since the relationship seems somewhat broken already? I really want to visit her for her birthday next month and wold have to buy the tickets soon but I dont think now is a good time surprises. Do I try to be relaxed and slowly ease back to communicating without pressuring? Or do i tell her how I feel and tell her: either you love me and we try it or you dont and we break up! I also really dont want her to just stay together with me out of pitty.

i want to make this work...  I hope its not lost... but am I being stupid?!
I really really dont know. I have never been so emotional about anything in my life before. i must have cried at least 15 times in the past 3 weeks.


Any input would be so welcome! 

**TLDR: Gf and I have been in LDR for quite some time. Everything worked out and were really in love just recently. but she went to south america for 2.5 months and things have gone really bad from then on mostly due to major communication problems. We didnt manage to get better in the 3 weeks she was here and is now off studying in France for 9 months. I want to make things better but dont know how. Any advice would be greatly appreciated**

Warning: This might be a long post so bear with me. I'm coming to yall out of a somewhat depressing state as to the nature of my life right now and I need some advice from individuals who not only support the smoking lifestyle but have battled through the adversity of struggling to find employment in the face of a history with weed. I am currently a senior in college right now and I'm very pro-marijuana. I condone smoking, I have friends that smoke, and I've smoked on and off for about 4 years now (even took a year off to clear my head). Recently I was offered an internship position with a highly profitable corporate company within their marketing department. Employment began this fall, but I had been smoking about a g a week on and off this passed spring and summer. The drug test really worried me, I took a detox supplement as well as drank alot of water and exercised. On my first day of work last week they had informed me that although I had passed the test the test concluded that it was too diluted with water and that I had to take an in-office drug screen to verify my sobriety. In hindsight I've made many bad decisions in my life, smoking at inappropriate times in critical points of my young adulthood, but I believed that because of my rate of smoking had dropped down to once every 2-3 weeks that I was on the right track to ensure that my future job hunt would not be hindered by a drug test, OR EVEN MORE SO that my mentality to search out and find the job that I truly wanted would not be sacrificed by my irresponsible smoking habits of the past. Well of course you probably know what happened, I had smoked 2 and a 1/2 weeks before the first day of work, failed the test, and lost the big boy job I've been working towards for 3 years now. I've been devastated by the fact that once again I've gotten in the way of my own success. Even if I've felt that it was time to smoke less and focus more, it appears that I was too late again.
Needless to say I went on a week binger since that week, smoking every opportunity I've had, and I've finally come to the realization that I need to move forward in my life instead of staying stagnant and depressed. My problem now is that because of this weed binger I don't think I will be able to pass any drug test that is presented to me within this month of september. I'm just about out of money from not working and I haven't been able to focus on this last semester of school because everyday I wake up thinking ""Can't get a job today, still have weed in my system...""
I'm pleading to the professionals of this world who either smoke weed, or have faced the problem of attaining the job in their desired field in the face of having smoked before employment. I don't know what to do because the more and more ideas i DON'T have, the more and more withdrawn i've become as a person. Like I said before I have no problem controlling my weed intake or my mentality when I'm high, but I'm faced with alot of questions that I don't think I can answer myself. Please, PLEASE, if theres any advice that r/trees could provide me I would greatly appreciate it.

Edit: I understand that a detox would be the first option start applying for jobs and I thank any forward links to proven detoxs. Why I wanted to contact r/trees is because I was hoping that yall could share any stories and experiences yall have had with a situation similar to mine and what the [personal and mental] outcomes to those were. I kinda just feel lost right now in between confused mentality and depressive actions"

A few weeks later I promised my little sister that I would come to her school instrumental performance in the afternoon. The day of the performance comes and I get told that the second staff meeting since I started working there would be that afternoon. I had to inform them that I'd be unable to stay.

Then a little while later I make a doctor's appointment for the first time in probably a year. The day of the appointment comes and I get told that another staff meeting was on, the third one I should have attended and I am yet to attend one. There was just no way to honestly say ""I have a doctor's appointment so I can't come"" and make it sound believable, so I had to call and reschedule the appointment."

As a college student, I'm starting to reach that time where I will be going to a lot of interviews and career fairs soon to look for internships and jobs.  As with most interviews, I'm going to be expected to look business casual when I walk in.

When it comes to business casual shoes, I have a unique problem: my feet have such a ridiculously high arch, that I've found flats don't stay on my feet very well.  This high arch also caused my foot to grow more ""up"" instead of ""out"", so my shoe size is about a 5.5 (women's).  Generally for sneakers I can get away with a six, but it's harder to do so in other shoes.

Since flats seem to be the go to shoes for business casual and I can't wear them, does anyone have a suggestion for what a good alternative would be?  Any help would be appreciated!"

zto3e,3,2012-09-13,I am worse than pathetic...,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/zto3e/i_am_worse_than_pathetic/,"I don't really know where else to turn to.  I have friends and family that would lend an ear and want to help, but for some reason I just can't face it, and I think in part I just don't really know how to describe what's going on... I guess I'm hoping that it might be easier for me to type it to strangers...

I have everything going for me... I'm in good health, I'm a good looking guy, I am widely recognised as being one of the most intelligent persons others meet, I have one of the best educations money can buy.  

I had a beautiful and amazing girlfriend all through college, an exceptional young woman in many respects, that I by and large neglected and didn't know or try hard enough to treat right.  She stood by me anyway because she knew that I was not in a good place in college, and she believed in my potential.  I hated education.  By the time it got to graduating from college, I was so good at doing the least amount of work possible to get the necessary grades, that I could learn entire courses from scratch in one or two days and get As.  I did the degree that was as difficult as possible for everyone else that I could imagine, but that I found exploitatively easy: theoretical physics.  I always liked physics, but the reality is that I did it at college because it is easy for me.  I'm sure some of you can relate to this.

As a result of my severe lack of engagement with my education, I turned to pot, video games, and the internet primarily through college to pass the time, which of course steadily built a number of bad habits, making me have destructive/evasive reactions to emotional discomfort, very bad work ethic, and a growing depression/dissatisfaction with my inability to apply myself to things that I thought were productive.  I can't count the number of times I've finished an epic video game, and then mournfully looked at the stats realising that at the end of the day, all that time means absolutely nothing.

I graduated college two years ago, and I moved away from my girlfriend back to my family to try to start a career.  I knew that the last few months had been particularly hard for her, since I'd been in a particularly depressive and dysfunctional state.  She'd been working for a year while I was in my final year of college, and it really contrasted against my life-style.  We agreed that I'd go home to my family after college and start to build a career, with the aim that not far down the road we could move to be in the same city.  For some reason, she decided that it would be better for us, two months after I moved away after college, that we go on a break.  I tried my best to fight that, but she wouldn't budge, and after a month or so of being extremely upset I finally caved in.  I was very upset that she had broken her promise to me only two months before, and that she didn't seem to care that I was agonized by what was going on.

Life went on though.  I got an internship at a pretty cool little company, and I dated a few girls too.  I got progressively more depressed with work though, and the girls I was dating were all not even in the same league of quality as my ""ex"", which made me even more lonely and hurt by what she did.  Eventually I found myself drinking too much in the evenings (I'd given up pot entirely then), working alone at the office and incapable of getting much of anything done but procrastination.  Ultimately the boss of the company and I decided I should work part time from home instead of full time, and while I did do that for a couple weeks, I ended up just falling into a depressive rut, returning to pot and video games, and somehow I managed to stop communicating with my (ex)boss for long enough that it became so awkward that I just couldn't bring myself to contact him.  I was living with a friend at the time and he eventually got fed up with my dysfunctional lifestyle too.

My ex-gf and I were in contact throughout the year, and by a stroke of luck really she invited me to come for a holiday with her family back in her home country.  We did have a good time there together, and at one point she actually asked me to marry her.  I was quite taken aback by that and I responded by saying I thought we should get back together as gf/bf first and work on the issues we had from the past before we make that decision, but it was something that I liked the idea of very much.  At the end of the holiday we had a fight.  I was hungry and tired at the end of a long day, and her and her parents randomly stopped at a mall on the way home and started buying her stuff (I don't speak their language fluently).  I was good company for a couple of hours, waited outside a boutique for 30 mins with the sun disappearing, and when she emerged I thought we were going to the car, but on the way she made a move towards a shoe store... I jokingly tried to stop her from going in, and she flipped out on me... I lost my patience and stormed back to the car to wait.  We had a further 5 minute argument in the car about it in front of her parents.  It seems now that as a result of this fight, it tainted the memory of the holiday quite significantly for her.  After I got home from the holiday, she was reluctant to agree to be gf/bf again.  I tried pushing her for a month over the internet/phone on that, before settling down with a reaction where if she would ask me what I did that day, I'd tell her that's an effort I would make for my girlfriend everyday, but it's a lot of bother otherwise to tell someone about your days all the time over IMs.

Behind this I was working on a new career direction, I was teaching myself how to trade financial instruments and getting myself set up with a system for that.  My hope was that I could use it as a way to make plenty of money on my own, and live a life intimately with my family and have time to pursue hobbies.  Unfortunately I never really fixed my bad work ethics, which is even worse when I work alone, and pot had managed to work its way back into my daily life.  About 3 or 4 months after the holiday with my girlfriend last summer, I decided with my mother that it would be good to get professional help for my alcohol/pot issues, and start working on the fundamental self-discipline issues too.  I told my (ex)gf this and she seemed to be happy with that and hopeful.  One month into doing this course (3 hours a day, 4 days a week), I find out from her that she's dating someone else... I tried and tried to tell her that this was really not ok with me, for her to be moving away from me after all that's been said and my efforts to set myself onto the rails... she kept telling me that it really wasn't a big deal, it didn't mean anything, she just missed the thrill of going on dates... and I kept telling her that if she respects my feelings and wants to be careful not to impede my efforts on the course to improve myself, she would stop.  She did finally stop, but not after 5 weeks or so of my being really very upset with her and talking with her almost every day, and not because she cared about my feelings after all, but because she went on a final date with him and decided that he wasn't inspiring enough.

This episode affected me harder and deeper than I realised at the time, it's difficult to describe the agony of feeling like you're losing someone you care about a lot and that you're helpless to stop it.  I came back to the city she was working in as soon as I could, after doing the minimum three months of the course.  I reasoned to myself that this city would be better for me to attempt to day trade financial instruments in too.  When I came back I was still in shock to be honest, and I still hadn't really solved the underlying work ethic issues that ultimately lead me to destructive avoidance behaviours like drinking and smoking and playing too many video games.  I started ok, this was March, and for the first month or two I was making some progress on my work, even though it was slow, and I did enjoy spending time with her, even though I was always feeling discomfort about the unresolved issues.  Her and I and not that good at communicating.  She has a family background that makes her generally quite a quite, private person, who likes to avoid conflict.  As I say too, I also just in part didn't understand what I was feeling towards her, I just knew that I was not happy.

Things started to slide.... she went on holiday, I went off to other places, she was always working and tired when around anyway.... I barely got to see her in person more than one or twice every fortnight, and it just wasn't enough for me to fix my feelings towards her.  I felt betrayed by her, I felt like she didn't really have my back like I thought she did, I felt like she didn't care as much about my future as she so much seemed to from her words... I was just angry and sad... I withdrew from the world... for some weeks the only other person I would see would be my pot dealer (yes, I fell back into pot after a few months back in her city, I just couldn't cope emotionally, but it makes it worse and worse... I know it's desperate).  I just... I just wanted to be alone... but in the end my hiding from the world and being constantly upset towards her, it drove her away.... and now she says that she's given up.  I really don't understand, from my perspective it seems like she's done almost nothing to reach out to me, to make peace with me over what happened, and I'm too stupid and upset to find a way to tell her what's bothering me about her behaviour in a way that gets her to respond to me in the way that I want....

I've reached a point now where I find it hard to eat any more, and I keep having suicidal thoughts.  I'm deeply depressed about the world, I struggle to find hope.  I can't find what I want to do with my life, I can't get myself to work effectively alone, I can't train my body like I want, the girl I thought was of my dreams is slipping away, and I can't tell if she's disappearing because she'll never really be the woman I thought she was and she doesn't know how to treat me in a way that gets the best from me, or if the best thing that ever happened to me is gone because I'm too fucking pathetic.

The only reason I'm not dead already is because I can't bare thinking about the damage it would cause to the people around me, especially my family.  But it's what I really really want right now.  I just want to escape, I can't take it any more.  I'm sorry for so many words, thank you if you listened to me."

He was not fond of religon.,NumenoreanX,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/ztnoj/my_brothers_eulogy_he_was_not_fond_of_religon/,"My brother was not a fan of religon. He was a good man because you should be a good man. My parents gave us the choice of religon when we were mature enough to make sucha rational decision. He followed after me, logic won over faith and superstition. 

He passed away a few days ago... Unknown cause. A 22 year old man, on his way to being a doctor, all he ever wanted to do was help people. I stood firm that there would be no references to ""God's higher plan"" in his entire funeral service. There could be no plan that would keep drug addicts/dealers, murderers, rapists, etc.. alive against all odds, and then take a perfectly healthy, 22 year old man in his sleep.

The world would have prospered from his genius, ingenuity and problem solving skills. 

I was given the honor of speaking on behalf of the family. Below is my Eulogy for him. Note, that I am no fan of religon, but would not consider myself technically ""athiest"". 

I wish you all could have gotten to know him, he was one of my best friends, and one of the greatest men I ever knew.

:

Do not cry. Do not cry for Peter. That is not what he would want. 

Cry for his mother and his father, who should never have to bury their own son.

Cry for his family, and his friends, now bereft of his company and companionship.

Cry for those whose lives he touched; and for those whose lives he will now never have the chance to.

But do not cry for Peter. When you think of Peter, think of him as he was; And smile.

Peter was “Life to its fullest”. 

Peter was “Every day as if it were your last”.

Peter was “ I do what I want!”

Peter was an instant friend. He got along with everyone from all walks of life. He could relate to anyone, on any level.

Peter was selfless. There are those that will always help you if you ask, and then there was Peter, who was there helping you before you even knew that you needed help. He was a True Friend.

Peter was “bright”. Bright in every sense of the word. Brilliant, Clever, Filled with light, Vivid, Intense. All these define Peter. Everyone knew when Peter walked into a room. He was shining, impossible to miss. No situation went without a quip or witty remark. Peter could find the humor in anything. Peter excelled at making people laugh. A comment I heard often around Peter was, “My smile muscles hurt…”.

Peter was an accomplished scholar. He graduated with Summe cum laude and a certificate of merit from Westlake High School, received awards for being a scholarly athlete and was given both a Meyerhoff and Mark-U-Star scholarship to UMBC to study in the fields of science and medicine. Peter had internships at Southwest Medical Center in Texas (researching Immune Response), at Stanford University in California (researching MS), and University of Maryland Medical Center (researching traumatic brain injuries on a government grant). He held a position doing clinical research at the Taste and smell clinic of Washington D.C., in conjunction with Georgetown University. 

Although it sounds like Peter spent all of his time in a lab, or doing homework, that would be very far from the truth. Peter was also a tremendous Athlete. He played soccer up until high school. In high school, he was on both the Football and the Wrestling teams. He went to the State Championships in Wrestling. Peter also participated in the wrestling club at UMBC. Even when he wasn’t involved in a sport, he was still at the gym, every other day, just to stay in shape.

Peter was also an avid outdoorsman, and an Eagle Scout. Hiking, camping, canoeing, skiing, snowboarding, snorkeling, scuba diving; he climbed some of the country’s highest mountains, and white water rafted some vicious class 5 rapids. Peter attended multiple high adventure camping tours, including Canoeing in Maine, Florida’s Sea Base and multiple treks at Philmont in New Mexico, the most intense High Adventure camping that our country has to offer. 

This amazing man, fit more into 22 years than most people can fit in to their entire lifetime.

I remember when my brother was born, July 11th 1990. I was 8 years old. I could not wait for the little guy to grow up. I couldn’t wait to get to know him. 

To be honest he wasn’t that interesting at first. There was a lot of sleeping and crying and feeding, and various “cleaning up” tasks that weren’t at all exciting to me. 

But over the next few years I got to watch in amazement as my brothers grew; first Peter, and then Tony.

As soon as they were able to walk and talk, I became a lot more interested. These little guys had potential. 

As the older brother, if I wanted them to play with me, then I had to teach them how. And so teach them I did; to get along, to share, to build legos and Kinex, to catch pokemon, to build a snow fort. It was the blink of an eye before they were all grown up, with thoughts and ideas, hopes and dreams of their own. These little guys changed my world, and have since they could speak, been my closest companions, confidants, and partners in crime. 

And it was not long before I found myself learning from them. Peter had a thirst for knowledge that was unquenchable. He loved learning, and in turn teaching others what he had learned. It helped that everything came so easy to him. There was very little that was truly challenging to Peter, and nothing that he could not accomplish once his mind was set on it. He was a natural.

A natural athlete, scholar, scientist, gardener, cook, boyfriend, cousin, nephew, grandson, Son, Uncle, Brother, and Friend.

And we have always been the closest of friends, the whole Clan, Nicole, myself, Peter and Anthony. I have known no greater love than that between my siblings and I. We are close enough to finish each other’s sentences, but most of the time we can tell what we are thinking with just a quick glance. It was impossible not to have a good time when we got together, no matter the circumstance.

That is why I can say with certainty that the last few days have been the hardest of my life, the hardest of our lives. Nothing in the world could have prepared me for this. No physical pain can compare. I found myself thinking, “I should have had another 60 years to get to know him, and to know his family, and to write this speech..”

As I thought this, it dawned on me, that I have something to learn from this; One last lesson from my Brother. Do not take life for granted, and cherish the ones that you love. Life is short and unpredictable.

You have probably heard these sayings before. Well for Pete’s sake I am saying them again. And I hope that you say them again, over and over, and never forget them. 

I know that tonight, as I hug my Wife, my Brother, my Sister, my Mother and Father, my beautiful nieces, my Grandmothers and Aunts and Uncles and cousins, my friends and the friends of my friends. As I hug them I will hug them closer, and tighter, and longer, and thank God that they are here to hug me back.

The loss of Peter is truly a tragedy. I know that it will be difficult to move forward without him in our lives. However, I also know that my brother would not want us to be overwhelmed with sadness. He was a very strong and positive individual, who always looked for the best in every situation. Let us remember him for all of his great qualities, and appreciate the time that we were given with him. Let us keep his memory alive in all of us for as long as we live.

On behalf of my family, I want to sincerely thank everyone for coming to honor my brother today. He meant the world to my family and me, and to see so many people come to pay him their respects means more to us than we can express in words. Thank you all.

Peter was an instant friend. He got along with everyone from all walks of life. He could relate to anyone, on any level.

Peter was selfless. There are those that will always help you if you ask, and then there was Peter, who was there helping you before you even knew that you needed help. He was a True Friend.

Peter was “bright”. Bright in every sense of the word. Brilliant, Clever, Filled with light, Vivid, Intense. All these define Peter. Everyone knew when Peter walked into a room. He was shining, impossible to miss. No situation went without a quip or witty remark. Peter could find the humor in anything. Peter excelled at making people laugh. A comment I heard often around Peter was, “My smile muscles hurt…”.

Peter was an accomplished scholar. He graduated with Summe cum laude and a certificate of merit from Westlake High School, received awards for being a scholarly athlete and was given both a Meyerhoff and Mark-U-Star scholarship to UMBC to study in the fields of science and medicine. Peter had internships at Southwest Medical Center in Texas (researching Immune Response), at Stanford University in California (researching MS), and University of Maryland Medical Center (researching traumatic brain injuries on a government grant). He held a position doing clinical research at the Taste and smell clinic of Washington D.C., in conjunction with Georgetown University. 

Although it sounds like Peter spent all of his time in a lab, or doing homework, that would be very far from the truth. Peter was also a tremendous Athlete. He played soccer up until high school. In high school, he was on both the Football and the Wrestling teams. He went to the State Championships in Wrestling. Peter also participated in the wrestling club at UMBC. Even when he wasn’t involved in a sport, he was still at the gym, every other day, just to stay in shape.

Peter was also an avid outdoorsman, and an Eagle Scout. Hiking, camping, canoeing, skiing, snowboarding, snorkeling, scuba diving; he climbed some of the country’s highest mountains, and white water rafted some vicious class 5 rapids. Peter attended multiple high adventure camping tours, including Canoeing in Maine, Florida’s Sea Base and multiple treks at Philmont in New Mexico, the most intense High Adventure camping that our country has to offer. 

This amazing man, fit more into 22 years than most people can fit in to their entire lifetime.

I remember when my brother was born, July 11th 1990. I was 8 years old. I could not wait for the little guy to grow up. I couldn’t wait to get to know him. 

To be honest he wasn’t that interesting at first. There was a lot of sleeping and crying and feeding, and various “cleaning up” tasks that weren’t at all exciting to me. 

But over the next few years I got to watch in amazement as my brothers grew; first Peter, and then Tony.

As soon as they were able to walk and talk, I became a lot more interested. These little guys had potential. 

As the older brother, if I wanted them to play with me, then I had to teach them how. And so teach them I did; to get along, to share, to build legos and Kinex, to catch pokemon, to build a snow fort. It was the blink of an eye before they were all grown up, with thoughts and ideas, hopes and dreams of their own. These little guys changed my world, and have since they could speak, been my closest companions, confidants, and partners in crime. 

And it was not long before I found myself learning from them. Peter had a thirst for knowledge that was unquenchable. He loved learning, and in turn teaching others what he had learned. It helped that everything came so easy to him. There was very little that was truly challenging to Peter, and nothing that he could not accomplish once his mind was set on it. He was a natural.

A natural athlete, scholar, scientist, gardener, cook, boyfriend, cousin, nephew, grandson, Son, Uncle, Brother, and Friend.

And we have always been the closest of friends, the whole Clan, Nicole, myself, Peter and Anthony. I have known no greater love than that between my siblings and I. We are close enough to finish each other’s sentences, but most of the time we can tell what we are thinking with just a quick glance. It was impossible not to have a good time when we got together, no matter the circumstance.

That is why I can say with certainty that the last few days have been the hardest of my life, the hardest of our lives. Nothing in the world could have prepared me for this. No physical pain can compare. I found myself thinking, “I should have had another 60 years to get to know him, and to know his family, and to write this speech..”

As I thought this, it dawned on me, that I have something to learn from this; One last lesson from my Brother. Do not take life for granted, and cherish the ones that you love. Life is short and unpredictable.

You have probably heard these sayings before. Well for Pete’s sake I am saying them again. And I hope that you say them again, over and over, and never forget them. 

I know that tonight, as I hug my Wife, my Brother, my Sister, my Mother and Father, my beautiful nieces, my Grandmothers and Aunts and Uncles and cousins, my friends and the friends of my friends. As I hug them I will hug them closer, and tighter, and longer, and thank God that they are here to hug me back.

The loss of Peter is truly a tragedy. I know that it will be difficult to move forward without him in our lives. However, I also know that my brother would not want us to be overwhelmed with sadness. He was a very strong and positive individual, who always looked for the best in every situation. Let us remember him for all of his great qualities, and appreciate the time that we were given with him. Let us keep his memory alive in all of us for as long as we live.

On behalf of my family, I want to sincerely thank everyone for coming to honor my brother today. He meant the world to my family and me, and to see so many people come to pay him their respects means more to us than we can express in words. Thank you all.

However, we're moving in May for my internship, and we've got a three week break before we have to be in Fort Worth.  We're starting to think that it would be better to get married before we move - I'll have time for a honeymoon (I'll be starting a new job in October, so probably no honeymoon), I'll be able to come a few days before the wedding to start decorating, and when we move to Fort Worth into our house where we're planning to stay and start a family, we'll already be married.  I think there is significance to that, even though we've already lived together for 7 months or so. 

We've been engaged a month, and I've been planning the wedding since.  I've got a venue, a caterer, and my mom is coming in from Colorado to go dress shopping in October.  Am I bonkers to think we can do this by May?  Even with graduate school?

Thanks!

*EDIT*  Thank you for all of the advice and positive thoughts!  We've officially moved it up, and I am SO excited!  Venue's booked, we're talking to caterers, and we're lining a photographer up today.  Can't wait for May!"

Well I haven't really done a personal post like this, ever!

Some of you know and some of you don't know. But I failed my summer exams, quite badly. In my college we are allowed sit repeats (suplementals).
The result for these repeat exams come out tomorrow and being honest here, I am petrified. I bite my naiils and they have currently been chewed down 
to the point on non existence. Between now and then, I wouldn't be suprised if I lost all my hair (melodramatic I know but sue me!). Some people would
say "" Ah sure John, if you didn't pass that just means that you didn't put the work in"" but thats the thing, I did! I put countless hours into studying,
to reading over college notes and looking up online for extra explinations. Exams...well exams just are not my thing. Continous assessment is where my 
strong point it. Heck, I've gotten best in my coarse in a good few assingments and projects, I've become project leader (and actually got the work done) and 
done so well that i was even offered a internship by my course director. That clearly shows i've put in the work during the year, that I'm a lazy asshat who 
just sat there at the back of lecturees ( besides Maths 2, but that shit was easy) and done nothing. I went to my lectures, I done the work. I was even personally
noted a few times by lectures. The BIG end of year project , we had to assemble a mangonel (a roman catapult) and redesign a new arm to get the projectile to 
travel further. My group basically left the re-designing of the new arm to me fully. The ammount of effort and calculations that were put into it and while it 
didn't look like much, there was a shit ton of maths behind it (well, maths to my best capabilities). One of our experiment co-ordinators came over and was 
talking to me about it, even he said it was interesting and offered a last minute suggestion to make it better. When the module lecturer came over, he commented
on how it was a highly ambitious design but a very well and the most creative design there. 



So it's clear that my work during the year is good and it's not laziness. I just don't do well under exams. I don't know what it is, if it's the pressure that 
gets to me or what. i mean I did repeat my leaving cert so I'm already a year behind and now if I don't get true that's going to put me another year behind 
people and I'm not so sure I'd be able to handle that. I find out tomorrow what's going to happen, and all of this worry might be in vain, but right now, I 
just don't think I'm good enough, that I deserve this coarse.



This year has been a combination of high and low, forced myself to realise a lot of things about myself, that I needed to adress me confidence issuues, that 
my father is a part of me no matter how much a try turn it away, that sometimes the wicked go unpunished. But I can easily say that this summer was the accumilation
of these highs and lows. I failed my exams [bad]. I found someone who made me smile in a way not many can [good - I don't like people. I've ever had a thing for one other person]. 
My close uncle was diagnosed with cancer[bad].
I put my self on the kidney transfer list to save a close family friends life [good]. I found out that me and my brother might have a genetic problem that might
cause us to randomly have strokes whwn we're older and would stop me from donating said kidney [bad]. Went to Arcadecon and the following event [Good, easily 
the best memories from the year are from this,  Thank you again Declan for putting all of thart time and effect into making arcade as amazing it is]. Close uncle 
who had heart attack gets worse and gets a heart attack, Bells paulsie, a stroke and blood clots [bad]. Mammy getting depressed and not being able to do anything
about it [bad]. Finally get the courage to ask someone out, get's rejected [bad - I know this ain't major but it was not long ago so the sting is still fresh]. 
Such a flux of feelings and experiences and on top of that, exams to worry about.



One person that did make this summer was Mark. I was able to like him, and he liked him. For the first time ever, I allowed myself to date someone. Getting close
 to him felt good. Things were going well until his athritus kicked in. After that things neer really were the same. Good but not the same. I asked him out on
monday and while I knew it deep down what his answer was going to be, I didn't want to believe it. It was a no. He gave the reason that he doesn't think he's
boyfriend material and that just means I failed. I failed to make him feel as good about himself as he made me feel good about me. I should have been able to
make him see that he is a truly fantastic person in so many ways, that he'd be worth any struggle that might happen.



My heads just all over the place right now.



I'm sorry for the lenght.



But thank you let me get that off my chest.

Honestly."

I'm hoping someone can shed a light on my plans since I'm pretty new to all of this. I'm weighting my options for when I graduate (~6months). I don't really like Brazil, the hot climate, the culture, the late technology, religion everywhere, and a bunch of other reasons which I don't think I need to justify for the purpose of this post. I have lived in the US for 2,5 years, by the way. 


**Questions:**

- The answer to this is probably yes, but, does having a couple years experience on a ''real'' (not an internship) job here in Brazil help me when applying to a job abroad? Should I even try it without this type of experience?

- I'd also like to know is what are my true options in regards to living abroad? Not for a semester or a year, but for a long time? What countries offer me that kind of possibility? 

**My details:**

- 20, male, white, single

- I live in brazil, would like to go to canada or somewhere in europe (somewhere preferably colder) 

- Will graduate as a bachelor in graphic design (UFPR - Federal University of Paraná)  in about 6 months.

- Experience (internships) as a web designer. 
 
- Portfolio (a little out of date): www.christopher-iv.daportfolio.com

- can speak english and portuguese fluently and knows a little bit of spanish.

- No criminal record


If there is anything you'd like to know I'm glad to answer. Thank you so much :D

The problem is, he left yesterday for a 6 week internship in NYC so I'm on my own as far as building up my card base and getting my feet under me. 
   I have about 150 mostly crappy cards. I know how to play standard, but we mainly played EDH, so most of my cards are U/R/B to follow my commander. Most of my EDH deck is made of cards from the Depths of Power Intro Pack, but that's mostly it. 
   My friend said to go to Reddit for help, so here I am. I am headed to my local game store tomorrow and I have ~$50. My idea is to buy a fat pack for the sheer volume and then maybe one or two decent cards in the display case. Is there something else I should look for? What will give me the best value, considering I need to build up my card base and preferably not just get total crap cards? Thank you very much in advance for the help
   tl;dr - New MTG player has $50 to spend and wants to get the best value at his LGS. WAT I DO?

I enjoyed the company culture, and how friendly most of the people here were. Unfortunately, I felt like my relationship with my manager was really lacking, and that he didn't care much about me at all. He's almost never in his office, and since he assigned someone else to oversee my projects, we hardly ever had a real conversation during my time here. 

And I have no idea why. I come in everyday to work with a smile on my face, and I try to make conversation whenever I can. Still, I can't help but feel they don't like my personality for whatever reason. 

I basically have a better relationship with the other interns' managers than I do with my own. Should I even bother to ask him if I could list him as a professional reference? "

I interviewed and received an offer for an internship all within about 72hrs.  I gave my stable job two weeks notice, and started this internship while finishing my two weeks.  

I was told that I'd get experience in the industry I've been working really hard to break into.  I understood this internship involved a few different responsibilities, but now they are having me do mostly the roles that I have no interest in.  In fact, I loathe it and would rather have kept my old job.  I don't see any value in it for the career I really want to pursue.  They told me one thing before I accepted, but now they are changing it.  

Not to mention, I've received some condescending comments and gestures.  Plus they haven't been understanding about my need to give my old job two weeks notice.  I'm getting paid minimum wage for experience in the wrong field.  I feel like I've been lied to and that they could easily find someone else that would actually gain something from this internship.  

Would quitting significantly affect future opportunities?  Is it worth sucking it up for the next several months?  I've brought up my concerns, and they just brush it off pretty much and tell me to give 100% in all roles of this job.  What should I do?  

**UPDATE** I emailed them my resignation.  In their replies (the two CEOs), they were trying desperately to convince me to stay.  They said (in contrast to what they said before) that a whole bunch of my work will be web dev.  This coming right after one of them said I will have barely any responsibility in that area.  Because of the inconsistencies and bad feeling in my gut, I emailed them back saying NOT INTERESTED!  Phew, glad this is over, I won't be checking that work email account again.  Blocked their numbers.  I'll know better next time.  Thank you all for helping me out!"

**League:** Advanced


**Goal:** Fat loss

I am hoping to lose 15-20lbs in the next 12 weeks. I would like to lose fat but also gain muscle. To accomplish this I plan to lift weights 3 times per week and do HIIT twice per week, with some moderate cardio workouts thrown in as well. I will also be trying out a Paleo diet. 


----

Additional info: I had my bodyfat measured using an Omron machine yesterday and the reading was 28.8%. I would like to decrease this as much as possible obviously, but if I could get to somewhere around 20% that would be great. 

I'm hoping to be able to take measurements tomorrow, and I will add those as soon as I can. 

Oh, and current lifts (all sets of 5):

Squat - 110lbs

Deadlift - 125

Bench - 80

OHP - 50

And by the end of these 12 weeks I would also like to be able to do at least 2 unassisted pullups. Current PR: 0. :(

I am participating in this challenge while doing an internship, and my hope is that by the end of the 12 weeks I will have developed good diet and exercise habits that will stick with me when I return to school in January. I have always had trouble with eating healthy foods and exercising consistently while in school, and I don't want to use that as an excuse any more! "

He was one of my best friends. My world will never be the same. Ask Me Anything.

I have offered to give the Eulogy, and speak on behalf of the family. It means the world to me to honor him with a memorable and inspiring speech, this is what I prepared:

Do not cry. Do not cry for Peter. That is not what he would want. 

Cry for his mother and his father, who should never have to bury their own son.

Cry for his family, and his friends, now bereft of his company and companionship.

Cry for those whose lives he touched; and for those whose lives he will now never have the chance to.

But do not cry for Peter. When you think of Peter, think of him as he was; And smile.

Peter was “Life to its fullest”. 

Peter was “Every day as if it were your last”.

Peter was “ I do what I want!”

Peter was an instant friend. He got along with everyone from all walks of life. He could relate to anyone, on any level.

Peter was selfless. There are those that will always help you if you ask, and then there was Peter, who was there helping you before you even knew that you needed help. He was a True Friend.

He was shining, impossible to miss. No situation went without a quip or witty remark. Peter could find the humor in anything. Peter excelled at making people laugh. A comment I heard often around Peter was, “My smile muscles hurt…”.

Peter was an accomplished scholar. He graduated with Summe cum laude and a certificate of merit from Westlake High School, received awards for being a scholarly athlete and was given both a Meyerhoff and Mark-U-Star scholarship to UMBC to study in the fields of science and medicine. Peter had internships at Southwest Medical Center in Texas (researching Immune Response), at Stanford University in California (researching MS), and University of Maryland Medical Center (researching traumatic brain injuries on a government grant).  He held a position doing clinical research at the Taste and smell clinic of Washington D.C., in conjunction with Georgetown University. 

Although it sounds like Peter spent all of his time in a lab, or doing homework, that would be very far from the truth. Peter was also a tremendous Athlete. He played soccer up until high school. In high school, he was on both the Football and the Wrestling teams. He went to the State Championships in Wrestling. Peter also participated in the wrestling club at UMBC. Even when he wasn’t involved in a sport, he was still at the gym, every other day, just to stay in shape.

Peter was also an avid outdoorsman, and an Eagle Scout.

Peter attended multiple high adventure camping tours, including Canoeing in Maine, Florida’s Sea Base and multiple treks at Philmont in New Mexico, the most intense High Adventure camping that our country has to offer. 

This amazing man, fit more into 22 years than most people can fit in to their entire lifetime.

It helped that everything came so easy to him. There was very little that was truly challenging to Peter, and nothing that he could not accomplish once his mind was set on it. He was a natural.

A natural athlete, scholar, scientist, gardener, cook, boyfriend, cousin, nephew, grandson, Son, Uncle, Brother, and Friend.

And we have always been the closest of friends, the whole Clan, Nicole, myself, Peter and Anthony. I have known no greater love than that between my siblings and I. We are close enough to finish each other’s sentences, but most of the time we can tell what we are thinking with just a quick glance. It was impossible not to have a good time when we got together, no matter the circumstance.

That is why I can say with certainty that the last few days have been the hardest of my life, the hardest of our lives. Nothing in the world could have prepared me for this. No physical pain can compare. 
I found myself thinking, “I should have had another 60 years to get to know him, and to know his family, and to write this speech..”

As I thought this, it dawned on me, that I have something to learn from this; One last lesson from my Brother. 
Do not take life for granted, and cherish the ones that you love. Life is short and unpredictable.

You have probably heard these sayings before. Well for Pete’s sake I am saying them again. And I hope that you say them again, over and over, and never forget them. 

I know that tonight, as I hug my Wife, my Brother, my Sister, my Mother and Father, my beautiful nieces, my Grandmothers and Aunts and Uncles and cousins, my friends and the friends of my friends. As I hug them I will hug them closer, and tighter, and longer, and thank God that they are here to hug me back.

The loss of Peter is truly a tragedy. I know that it will be difficult to move forward without him in our lives. However, I also know that my brother would not want us to be overwhelmed with sadness. He was a very strong and positive individual, who always looked for the best in every situation. Let us remember him for all of his great qualities, and appreciate the time that we were given with him. Let us keep his memory alive in all of us for as long as we live.

On behalf of my family, I want to sincerely thank everyone for coming to honor my brother today. He meant the world to my family and me, and to see so many people come to pay him their respects means more to us than we can express in words. Thank you all.

zsz92,7,2012-09-12,Internship Opportunity Advice,senornerd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zsz92/internship_opportunity_advice/,"Recently I applied for an internship, namely an ""*Undergraduate Research Programmer*"" position. It was a tough interview and it certainly wasn't my best but I felt I still did well. Well enough to be offered a position, however it was not the position I wanted nor applied for. 

They offered me a ""*Systems Administrator*"" position possibly thanks to my few years of work experience in a related field. This position will not include any programming per se. It will be technical in nature and therefor I do not see how it can benefit me as I'm trying/hoping to get relevant programming experience and find an internship that can stimulate and aid my growth as a student of CS.
I'm unsure of what to do. The job will come with a few sacrifices, like reducing free-time I'll have available to study, and it will require more daily travel. But it is paid, not much but some.

I wonder if taking the job will help me land the one I wanted when another round of hires happens, but that's a risk. 
If there's no intrinsic value to this job, and no foreseeable long term value... is it worth it?

Thanks for any advice!"

I've always wanted to be on the giving end, but never thought I would have to ask for help. Here's my situation. I am a mechanical engineering student with just two quarters to go to finish my degree. I pay for my own school, I pay for everything on my own. I was working an internship at a chemical plant in Joliet and it was supposed to go until November 21st which is the week I return to school. Well they ran out of money to pay me and I've been laid off. I just bought a car, it's not much but it gets me around. And boy am I glad I have it as it's also my apartment right now. I had a nice place that I was renting in Joliet, but I couldn't afford the rent and I lost my apartment. I've exhausted my savings and pretty much have nothing left. I've been driving around applying everywhere and got a call back to deliver pizzas. However, I can't make ends meet with this as I am paying $200/MONTH on my truck. I've been applying to pretty much every Craigslist gig in the area to no avail. I got taken advantage of once after working a 12 hour day and the people refused to pay me. I applied for unemployment and was told I will receive $51/week. Not much but it helps. Today I found out my truck needs new brakes and I'm looking at $550 to replace them. Oh well, I guess I will just have to live with them at the moment. I'm done crying, I feel like that's how I've fallen asleep the past week. I came here because I need help. If anyone could give me a job in mechanical engineering as an intern I promise you will not regret it. Or if someone needs yard work done. Or really anything. I am a very hard worker, I am reliable, I am motivated. I wanted to return to school this winter to finish my degree but now that I have no savings to do so that seems like an impossibility. I hope there is someone out there that can help. I don't know what else to do. I never thought I would find myself in this situation. I guess no one does. 


UPDATE:
So I met up with 420is404 and he is an incredibly awesome guy. The kindness he has shown me brought tears to my eyes. He is one of the most genuine, kind, awesome, generous, and epically incredible people I have ever met in my life. The repair ended up being a little more involved than either one of us could've imagined when we embarked on our journey to repairdom. Being that the truck is almost 20 years old, there were several parts that needed to be replaced in addition to the pads and rotor. Needed new wheel bearings, new caliper, new cam assembly, grease, and some specialized tools. 420is404 purchased all of this for me. Not only did he do that and spend his day off helping me, he also let me borrow his truck so that I could work. I have never before in my 22 years on this earth experienced such kindness and genorosity from a complete stranger. But stranger no more is he - I think I've made a friend for life. And when I graduate and get a full time engineering job I'm going to pay him back for everything. Also, I hope that I can do something like this for someone when they need it the most. This experience has completely changed my outlook on life. Never again will I take what I have for granted because I know how quickly it can all be gone. Also, It has taught me that people are an inherently good species. I feel so so SO fortunate for someone to have done all of this for me. Another good development - I was approved for emergency food stamps so starting Tuesday I will receive more than enough benefits to take care of my food needs. SOOOOOO many thanks to 420is404 for everything he has done for me. Words alone cannot express the monumental depth of my gratitude. 

Now all I need is a full time job that pays in the neighborhood of $12-15/hr and I'll be set. If anyone has connections that could land me an engineering internship let me know and I'll shoot you my resumè. Thank you to everyone for the advice and kind words, I really appreciate the uplifting comments. Of anyone needs some help around the house or office let me know l; I'm a hard worker!! 

Reddit is truly an amazing place full of wonderful people. Like I told 420is404, 20 years from now when I hopefully have a son of my own I can't wait to recount this experience to him and tell him about the time his dad was down on his luck and he was pulled up out of it by a truly wonderful person. 

I'll finish this book length update with one of my favorite quotes of all time.

zsve5,1,2012-09-12,[21/m] Is my girlfriend (20/f) trying to break up with me? Or am I just paranoid? I need serious help.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zsve5/21m_is_my_girlfriend_20f_trying_to_break_up_with/,"I wrote a lengthy letter to my girlfriend to call her out for dragging me along a break, when I somewhat know she is just using it as a way to break up with me so that I am not offended. I'm a journalism major, sometimes words are necessary.


I just need to know if my points are valid/reasonable, and if I have any reason to be upset. 

tl;dr I think my girlfriend is going to break up with me, and has used some really weird tactics lately. please read below to understand more.
 
ARTICLE START---- APOLOGIES FOR WEIRD FORMATTING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO TO FIX IT! 

	Jennifer, the last few weeks have been indescribable. This will be very hard to get through, so excuse me while I try to. I’ve never come into a serious talk with a prepared statement. I have so many things flying through my mind at a million miles an hour that it seemed like the best option. I can’t think of any other way to address all the things on my mind without forgetting something, without rambling, or making myself unclear.
---
	I will start with what scares me the most: That you are such a kind and gentle person, that you are afraid to hurt me in any way.  When we started this relationship, and we sat down, I asked that we communicate with each other and be honest. I have a sneaking suspicion, that I will add I really hope isn’t true, that you have known for quite some time that you didn’t want to be with me any more.

----
	I fear that you may have used the supposed break that I never really agreed to as a vehicle to break up with me so that I would see it coming and take it easier. I don’t know if this were just I being paranoid and terrified, it certainly wouldn’t be the first time this has happened. 
	 All I know is that if you did this in any way, I would be angry. I am not accusing you of this – I am simply saying that I am worried that it might be the case, due to your word choice over the last few weeks, and due to your friends, whom I know you confer with and get advice from.
	I have a few reasons to believe that this might be the case, or they might just be coincidental.
	When you first sat me down in tears, back when you first visited me at my Allston house, you broke down crying. What you told me that day has completely changed how I looked at our relationship. There was no way it couldn’t change things: That night you had told me that I had been too stressed out with my life, and that we simply weren’t having fun anymore. 
You said that I was going through a hard time, and that it was carrying over to our relationship, and had been doing so for over a month. You told me I had certain characteristics that weren’t ever going to be compatible with you, and you stressed that you were worried that I wasn’t the right one for you. I am deeply sorry for that, and that night, I felt absolutely crushed. But I knew I had to change if I wanted to save us. I had no fucking choice. I had to buckle down.
	Of course, the fact of the matter is, you broke a rule of our relationship. You were supposed to tell me, stop me, before things got bad. You were supposed to communicate. And so by the time it was too realized, I realized that I was the one that needed to change anyway.
	And then an odd thing happened, just 12 hours after you cried and cried and cried about all of this, right on my shoulder. And then, the VERY NEXT DAY, it happened. You did EXACTLY what you had critisized me for doing, and then cried about. 
 You spend an entire afternoon texting me about things that, quite honestly, paled in comparison to what I had been dealing with over the last month, and what you are dealing with currently. Hear me out Jennifer, you’ve put up with some horrible stuff lately. You’ve had TONS of stress in your life, and a brother leaving for college, and other things I don’t need to mention. But that day, it was just petty things, and you were out of control with rage. 
Personally, I was absolutely livid at what I saw and heard from you, just HOURS after you had emptied your heart to me in a last ditch effort to save our relationship. How dare you cry on my shoulder and tell me that I need to change how I handle my stress because it was dragging me down, cry on my shoulder for thirty minutes, like it means the world to you, and then the next day, you do that same thing to me. I just don’t see how you could have done that. And that’s when I began to worry that you were going to break up with me.
Why wouldn’t I think that? How can the girl I love cry to me over something so exact, saying how painful it was for me to throw all that stress on you, and how it was dragging us down, and then you do that very painful thing to me the very next day!	It seemed so bizarre. At the very least, if that was the only thing bothering you at the time, then you owe me an apology for your actions the next day. 
The only thing I could think after you did that to me was that there was something much bigger pulling at your strings, something more important that was drawing you apart from me, and that you just didn’t have the will to continue with me. There’s just no other way I could explain you doing that to me hours after you claimed it was so hard to deal with. So pardon me if I am wrong, but I had reason to think so because of what you did.
	Just to clarify things, let me read of the texts you sent me, so you can remember:

“My mom is so frustrating I could cry cant wait to move out of here”

“And to top it all off I lost the cord to my iPhone so I need to order a new one ugh I am so annoyed right now”

“I can’t even get a response about this internship because the professor is a moron and doesn’t want to do his job

“I’m not going to relax until my life is finally settled I can’t deal with all these pending things.”

That last quote, my jaw dropped. Jennifer. You had nearly broken up with me, you had given me an ultimatum (e.g. “fix this, or it won’t work out”) You looked me squarely in the eye, cried to me for over a half an hour about how I had put so much stress on you, while you shook and sobbed. This conversation in my room had directly altered one of the most Important things in my life, and I realized needed to overcome the stress in my life to treat you better. 
Once your texts started to trickle in 12 hours later, I sat there in my room, confused, texting back encouraging things as you absolutely stunned me with your lack of consideration for what you had just done. You challenged who I was as a person, to my very core, and then you spent a good 5 hours complaining about an iPhone cord and a situation you literally could not control under any means at that point. You said I wasn’t relaxing and dealing with the pressures of my life well enough, and said I needed to fix it for us to be happy. The very next day, you said that you weren’t going to relax until your life settled down.
Just days later, you acted like everything was completely normal around me at 10 Carmel.

For sake of not making things awkward, I appreciated you holding yourself together. I appreciate that you didn’t walk out, break down or act awkward. But there wasn’t even anything close to a middlegroudn that entire night. You acted completely normal, hardly acknowledged me, and had absolutely flawless, normal conversations with everyone as if nothing was amiss. I shot glances over at you, wanting to see if you had any sign of discomfort or sadness. You laughed loudly dozens of time, joked with everyone, and in general, not once showed ANY sign of hurt THE ENTIRE NIGHT I WAS THERE. That devastated me beyond words; I couldn’t bear to see you that normal after a situation so devastating to me. I didn’t understand how you could do it. 
	
I had so much pain in my heart and all I wanted to do was cry, but the girl I loved was 5 feet away, acting as if our relationship wasn’t on pins and needles. While I appreciate your composure in a certain sense, it was so hard. I can imagine (or at least hope) you felt a lot of strain in your heart that night, but you put on an absolutely FLAWLESS image that everything was 100% ok. I honestly don’t think I could have ever done that. As much as it probably makes me a horrible person to wish you were a bit sad, I really wished I saw a sign of sadness in you that night. I saw nothing. 

Once again, I will get back to the subject of all of this. Ultimately, my biggest fear has been that you have already made up your mind that you no longer wish to be with me, and that you are simply using this break as a means to cut to an easier break up. It would be so hard just to break up with me flat out, but If we took a few weeks off, then you could just play the “this isn’t ever going to work again” card, and because of our basic mini-break up slash break, it wouldn’t be as devastating to me.  You don’t want to see me sad, so I can understand that, but I would still be furious.

In the days that preceded the 10 Carmel run in, life got a little better. I started to see my friends at school, and it really took my mind of things. Your grandmother died, and I tried to be there for you. It was around this time that I started picking up on language that indicated that you didn’t want to be anything but friends. 

You said things like, “You will always be an important person to me,” which implies that I will always be important to you, even if we break up. To me, you don’t say that to someone in a situation like this unless you intend to break up with him or her. 

Then, you removed your relationship status from facebook. I can’t even claim that was a step towards breaking up with me, that just hurt for whatever reason.
	
And then, when you asked for a hug, you said “you needed a friend right now.”

Anyway, by no means are those few texts proof that you just want to be friends.

But then, that day, I started to panic a little, because I saw the trend coming back. I saw that you started to treat me like a friend, so I texted Mary and Sammie. What Mary said to me was really hurtful, not because of anything insulting, but because it sounded like a prepared statement that went through you first.
	Mary said that you needed to figure out what you needed and wanted.
What else could that mean? Clearly, she had at some point, figured out that you had a decision to make. Why was it that Mary thought that you needed to decide on something? What did you need to decide on? What did you need and want? From what I understood at our last talk in your new room, you just wanted a break and were strictly against breaking up. When I said that I wouldn’t do breaks, you kept asking why not.
	So what lead Mary to believe that you had to figure out what you wanted to do? I thought we had just agreed but not really agreed to take a break…
	To me, it sounds like you’ve been telling Mary things that you haven’t had the courage to tell me, which is that you want to break up with me, but might not be 100% sure. 
	Let me put it to you this way. Let’s say that I’m just completely scared out of my mind and that none of this is true. Let’s say that all you’ve told Mary is that you want a break to let things heal and see how they go.
	Why then, would Mary suggest to me that you need time to figure out what you want and need? Supposedly, you know what you want and need, and that is a break. It sounded to me that Mary had some extra knowledge, and that you were once again using the break, which started weeks ago, as a means to break up with me without hurting me.
	If that is the case, All I can say is this. You broke the trust of this relationship. You failed to communicate with me, and you deceived me into thinking that I had a standing chance to fix our relationship through hours of personal reflection and thought. 
	If this is the case, I don’t think we can be friends. If this is the case, we haven’t broken up because of inseparable differences; we haven’t broken up due to stress in our lives. If this entire entire essay was the case, you just don’t like me anymore and want out. Anyone that throws me to the curb because I’m supposedly not good enough for them doesn’t deserve to be my friend. To me, this sounds like a normal break up that you’ve been putting off due to your own fear, and if it is, I don’t think I’ll be speaking to you for a long, long time. If this is because you don’t think I’m a good enough person to make you happy, I can’t wait to prove you wrong.

	Like I said, there was really no way for me to come into a conversation and throw this all on a table. Any missed piece here or there, and what I’m saying sounds like a bunch of insecurity.

You don't have to read the next part, just me talking:

I hadn't really had a long state of depression this year until the summer began. I moved back to the middle of nowhere, Indiana for an internship. For some reason that seemed to trigger one of the worse and deepest depressions I've ever had. It lasted for nearly two months. As the summer drew to an end, I got better. By the time I got back to school, I was happy (not manic). I was back with friends and back in an environment I seem to thrive in. I've had days since the semester began where I feel slightly manic and can tackle anything I set out on and I've had days where I've been slightly sad. But recently a relatively small issue triggered another depressive state. Looking back, the event wasn't really anything too important, but it set me off. Is this a rather common occurrence among those with bpd?"

zstb7,2,2012-09-12,i'm slowly giving up. ,FreeeKarl,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/zstb7/im_slowly_giving_up/,"I try to talk to friends but they are slowly getting over my negativity so I'm going to turn to a bunch of strangers to see Thor POV. 

it's kind of long but here goes: 
I'm not happy in life whatsoever. I'm dumb for it though. bc I'm not starving, I have a roof, and I'm kinda healthy. but I still feel like crap and so unappreciative. 
graduating college has been such a big step for me. one- bc I've been scared of the real world and the inconsistency of it and two- bc idk what's going to happen. I fear for the future bc I don't know what's there. going to school, I KNEW what was going to happen. I was used to going to school and doing homework and homework. but after graduation, I was like 'now what.' I didn't know what was going to happen and that scares the living shit out of me. I hate not knowing and the unknown. 
I've been applying to jobs since may. everyone said to start applying by January but I felt that the employer wouldn't look at my app because I haven't graduated yet. but anyways, I fucked up on that part. so I've been applying like crazy to jobs and I see everyone getting a job somewhere and already working. and I'm stuck at my part time job. I am loathing that job bc I don't wanna get stuck there like some of my co workers. I've always been motivated and career driven.  I went to this interview for Production assistant for a tv show which woulda been perfect but I didn't get hired and I don't know why. I wish I did bc I woulda been working already and everyone at my school wouldn't see me as a failure. i didn't get that fuckin job and no one understands how much I'm so mad about it. my friends say that's it not a big deal and there will be others but that job could've started it for me. and my major isnt a easy one. so at least getting an interview is a step in...not getting the job is a different story. to get an interview as a PA ia a BIG thing in one's career. there aren't ever that many PA open positions bc usually they hire interns. idk what I did that fucked up that interview. I told them I was ready for a heavy workload job like that and they like my answers. i'm just so mad about it and I'm so mad at myself. I feel like a failure. 
i know im stupid for saying this but i want to start working and paying my debt and being on my own and comfortable. I don't wanna struggle with a gay ass part time job at the age of 25 with a college degree. I want to help my parents out with their bills bc I hate seeing them struggle and it gets me so mad that at one point, we were doing OK and now, we're living paycheck to paycheck with so much debt. I don't wanna grow up &amp; have my kids, and have them deal with it. I know my parents have tried their best giving my sister and I everything in the world and I'm VERY thankful for that. and I would like to do that for my kids. I don't want to struggle or see my kids struggle. 

 I feel like I'm at a standstill. and I'm so depressed from it. I'm going to be 25, I'm completely single and I have debt up my ass with no good job. I have a fear of turning 25 because I'm so unhappy. beyond unhappy. and I feel so alone. my last boyfriend was 6 years ago in HS. I still am single. single as single can be. like no baggage, no potential, no texting someone, no nothing. and this emptiness and loneliness sucks. last time i had a something was last summer and that lasted 3 months. i havent had love in a very very long time and that can seriously ruin someones ego. i feel like I'm not gonna meet anyone bc all I do is go to the gym, work at my PT job, chill with my friends, and stay home. there is no way I can meet someone. and I don't like meeting people at bars or dating sites. I'm a very pretty girl, I know this. I'm losing weight, have an average body and I have personality. but idk why I'm so single. my friends are already engaged and stuff. it sucks bc, come the weekend, my friends wanna stay home but I want to go out bc I've been deprived from society. 

I know everyone says that good things comes to those who wait but I mean COME ON!!
waiting 6 years for a new boyfriend is a long long time. and waiting so long for a job is lame. [i know the job market sucks right now but i think since i'm so career driven, thats whats putting me down] obviously something is wrong with me. something HAS to be wrong with me if I fail at love and work. 

I seriously have nothing to look forward to. at all. my 25 fuckin birthday is coming up and I'm terrified. fuckin terrified bc 25 is a quarter of my life. that's a long time. and there is no way that I'm happy. its going to be the worst day ever. I always saw my future as a happy one and being successfull. but I'm not. at all. and I don't think it's gonna change bc if it hasn't changed in the past 6 years which was the LAST time I was completely happy, it's not going to change. I tried to be positive and that didn't even work for me. 
I don't wanna be old and have a lot of regrets. I want to look  back and be like 'I lived an awesome successful ass life'. I try soooooooo hard to be happy but i have nothing to look forward to anymore. absolutely nothing. i don't have a reason to be living because honestly, living THIS LIFE LIKE this EVERYDAY, is pointless. I rather be dead and buried in my grave then live like this for another 6 years.


TLTR: crazy career driven girl, just graduated college, unemployed, feel like my life is going nowhere, im alone, and getting older and I want to give up. don't know what to do anymore. "
zsqjy,5,2012-09-12,I just completed a 3 month internship at a production studio. AAMA,lost_genr,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/zsqjy/i_just_completed_a_3_month_internship_at_a/,"Hey all! A while back some people were interested in hearing about my internship experiences (okay, I got like 5 upvotes on a comment I made on my main account). So here it is, I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons. We post/read a lot of articles about other people's internship experiences, I figured it might be cool to discuss the experiences of a regular to r/lostgeneration.

**I will not be disclosing:** a) the city I worked in (however it's a major Canadian one), or b) the studio I worked for (I'm also wary of disclosing the type of work they do there, ie. post-production, 3D, VFX, etc). The reason for this is because it's a *small* industry, even on a global scale. I'm doing this because I think discussion about internships is important, but I don't want to accidentally burn bridges I didn't know existed. Hope you can understand that.

I just finished a production internship at a growing studio in a major Canadian city. I learned the realities of working on a kid's TV show, and its pipeline. I had a great time. The people I worked with were great, the environment was awesome and I wasn't paid for my work. It wasn't always big smiles and sunny days though, most evenings when I was at home I was really depressed and some nights I would feel really hopeless. I nearly had a panic attack at work one day due to the financial stress I'm under. Although I did a fantastic job (I was even given a cash bonus, several letters of recommendation and given some good leads on jobs that weren't offered to the other interns) I sit here, currently unemployed. I'm in my mid-twenties, live with my SO in a neighbouring city, fresh out of a post-grad program. My employer paid for my monthly transit/commuting costs, and the internship was strictly for 3 months, their policy/program. Oh, and this was my 2nd and final internship.

So, yeah, I think that's decent info to start with. Hopefully this generates good conversation that's relatively hopeful/positive, as I had a really bad day lolol. If not, that's cool too. COME AT ME! "

zsoei,2,2012-09-12,Best Approach for Getting an Internship in CS?,imbadatinterviews,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zsoei/best_approach_for_getting_an_internship_in_cs/,"Currently a second year Computer Science undergraduate in one of the two big Bay Area universities (won't say which one), but we get visits quite frequently from companies in the area, hosting career fairs or info sessions. I'm starting to look for internships for next summer, and I've worked on a host of personal projects and held a programming job before. I try to emphasize this on my resume but, my technical GPA is not too great (~3.0), and I'm not sure what my approach to getting summer internships should be. 

Recruiters often have dozens of students talking to them, and handing off my resume seems largely ineffective. However, applying online seems to put me into a pool of people all over the world, and seems much more competitive. 

tl;dr: Any protips for those of us applying for internships?

Also, does anyone suggest possibly an internship abroad? Are there any short internships available over winter break?"
zsnpc,12,2012-09-12,"What's the gap between ""enthusiastic noob"" and ""employable""?",Semiel,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zsnpc/whats_the_gap_between_enthusiastic_noob_and/,"**Background**: I'm a recent college grad in a thoroughly unrelated field (""History and Philosophy of Science""). I went to a very prestigious (top-10) school and got a good GPA, but this is likely irrelevant as I didn't take a single CS class.

I'm currently working as a legal assistant at a law firm. It's a survivable job, but definitely not where I want to stay for too much longer. It's not super demanding, so I have a lot of time after hours to work on my own projects.

I have had some minor exposure in how to think like a programmer (LEGO mindstorms, helping friends with CS homework), but didn't start actually learning a real programming language until the past couple weeks. For a variety of reasons (which I could go into if people cared), I think this would be an enjoyable and rewarding career path.


**Goal**: To get to a point where I can have a reasonable chance of getting a programming job that will pay the bills. ""Pay the bills"" is a reasonably low bar: I'm currently making $12 an hour, and I'm fine with that. 

A potential difficulty, however, is that I'm not in a financial position to take anything like an unpaid internship.


**General battle plan**: At the moment I'm learning the basics of Python. I've done Google's intro to Python and most of ""Learn Python the Hard Way"", and am starting the Udacity CS 101 course. After that, I intend to work on my own projects to get more experience with solving actual problems. As quickly as is feasible, I'll transition to working on open source projects and building a good GitHub. At some point in there, I'll presumably also work on learning languages from other families, and strengthening my theoretical knowledge of programming.


**Questions**: 

1) Is this feasible at all? Research on this subreddit and other places leads me to believe that it's possible to go into programming without a degree in it. Is this true?

2) Is my battle plan a reasonable one? What am I missing? What should my priorities be?

3) What milestones should I be shooting for? What point would I have to get to before it would be reasonable to start sending out applications?"
zwisn,8,2012-09-14,"Girlfriend [28] moves in after 5 year relationship, last 2 years long distance, moves out after 11 days. [27 M] What happened?",thebigl58,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zwisn/girlfriend_28_moves_in_after_5_year_relationship/,"Hi reddit. I’ve been a lurker for a little while now, and this is my first post. I need some help figuring out my first real break-up after a long distance relationship. This is probably like the longest post ever, like a freaking novel. I hope that someone will take the time to read about the last few years of my life. I’ve spent a lot of hours gathering my thoughts. What I really hope is that getting this all out of my system will be cathartic in some way. Any advice that any of you could give would help me sleep better. So here we go.

A little back story on me. I played football in college for 2 years before I sustained a pretty devastating knee injury (pretty much the way of the offensive lineman). I was torn about whether or not to hang it up after the injury, but with the rigor of school (and the chance of further injury), I decided to quit. All of that is to say that I put on a considerable amount of weight before I started work in the real world after school because I continued my eating and drinking habits, but not any exercise.

I met my now ex at our first job out of school (We can call her Riley). I was hooking up with a former fling (nothing serious) from high school when I came back to my hometown to work, and I didn’t look at Riley as girlfriend material. I was just trying to figure out my new job. We became really fast friends. She played college soccer and was really athletic, and also a huge football fan so we fell right in. We seriously were inseparable. People at work were starting rumors about a relationship between us. We both shrugged them off as ridiculous, although I was beginning to have some feelings. I knew she didn’t reciprocate because of my appearance at the time. We started running together on a regular basis, and she pushed me hard. I started working out on my own and eating properly and lost a lot of the weight. Went from 290 to about 245.

So after about 3 months into our friendship, we decide to go to a UGA game together on our company tickets. We hang out with some of my friends who were still in school there, and proceed to get sloshed beforehand like any good SEC fan. She ran off to find some of her friends at another tailgate spot, and I stayed with mine. Well, she gets lost coming back in the mass of humanity, and cell reception is terrible. I eventually leave to go seek her out and she runs up grabs my hand and hugs me and says “Don’t ever lose me again”. That was it for me, seriously like a lightning bolt. I was in love, and I had to have her.
At the time, she lived with 2 of her soccer teammates from college (Aside: these girls were super hot and fun; which was totally awesome) in a house. I was living at my parents like a fucking loser, but she always invited me to stay at her house on weekends so I didn’t have to drive drunk back out of the city. I slept on the couch.

 I started becoming really good friends with her one roommate and confided my feelings to her about Riley. I was too much of a pussy to come out and ask her feelings about me myself, but I also didn’t want to ruin my relationship with the person who had turned into my best friend (and not to mention a coworker). Her roommate kept my secret. Eventually I made my move at the bar one night, and she denied me. She whispered that she didn’t want to have any PDA with work people around (which there were), we went back to her place and I was in.

We didn’t have sex for a few weeks after that but were definitely fooling around. Before we slept together, she did tell me this “I wish I had met you 4 years from now”, meaning she wasn’t sure if she was ready for a relationship. I told her I was here now, and that’s how it happened so let’s just go with it. We started sleeping together and everything was great like it always is at the beginning of a relationship. I don’t know if I’ve ever been happier. I had gotten out of the friend zone. I finally moved out of my parents and got my own place down the street from her and she was spending 3 or 4 nights a week at my place. 
Then the recession happened. We had taken an entry level job at a real estate finance firm in the investor services dept (read: answering the phone and listening to irate investors). IT WAS HORRIBLE. We were chained to our desks and working long hours, with no foreseeable advancement in that dept. Riley actually began to put on some weight because we were both so unhappy with our jobs and we had stopped working out because of the long hours. We felt like things would turn around soon so we stuck with it and didn’t look for other jobs (mostly because there weren’t any)

We both started studying for the CFA which is an extremely rigorous financial exam that takes about 3 years to complete to try and make ourselves more marketable. That took up a lot of time as well and added to the stress in our lives. Riley began having more body issues, constantly saying she was fat, and we kind of went in a slight downward spiral. During this time she also changed birth control because she felt it was too expensive on our medical plan. I believe it changed her mood for the worse. She never confided in me any feelings of true depression or extreme body issues, other than the occasional “I feel fat”. She was still initiating sex. You’ll see why I mentioned that later.

One night at her house, her roommate and her boyfriend were in another one of their typical knock-down, drag-outs so we go into her room so they can scream their heads off. Riley looks at me and she said “What we have is so much more special than anyone else I know, you’re the person I want to marry, I want to be with you for the rest of my life”. I told her I felt the same way.

So we’re now a little over 2 years into the relationship and Riley decides that she’s had enough of work and she wants to get her MBA. She applies to schools in a few different places, but the key is that she applied to Georgia Tech, in Atlanta, and SMU, in Dallas (where she’s from along with the last 4 generations of her family, everyone still lives there). She called me sobbing the day didn’t get in to Tech, but she got into SMU. I had just (finally) been promoted at work, and wanted to ride it out for a little while longer to get the work experience. I thought of it as diversifying our career risk. She goes to school, I get work experience. We talked about it this way, which honestly for a couple of 25 year olds is pretty mature. We were taking a long term view of our life together.

We decided that she would move to Dallas, and that I would continue to work at our company to get work experience before changing jobs. The goal was that I would try to move in a year. The day she moved to Dallas was, at the time, was the worst day of my life. We told each other that we would get through it, and we’d be better off in the end.

Things were tough (obviously), but we managed. I saw her maybe once every month on average, i.e 2 trips in 4 weeks then a 6 week stint. At her Christmas that year, she came and stayed with me in my new rental house for 5 weeks. I had to work some of that time while she was off for winter break, but we had a great time. It was really great. We went on a trip to the North Georgia mountains and had one of the best weekends of our relationship, and had tons of sex. 

After our trip to the mountains, she had to go back to school. We were going to be apart for about 3 months. We decided that for her spring break we’d go on a cruise. I made it a goal of mine to lose 20 more pounds before the trip. I started doing Crossfit (Riley was too) and lost the weight I wanted. I was in the best shape of my life, probably around 230 lbs. We had an incredible cruise, met some great people, and just laughed.

So at this point, while I don’t have a body like Matthew McConaughey, but I’ve taken great strides towards getting in shape so I can have a better sex life. 

At the end of her first year, the MBA students were required to go on a trip abroad. She chose South America. She ends up making out with a Brazilian guy while she’s down there. She doesn’t tell me until she gets back, but she had emailed her sister about it when she was there. I guess she wanted to tell me over the phone rather that email me about it. This was the week before one of my CFA exams and was horribly stressful and I wanted to die, but I forgave her because I honestly don’t know what I would have done if I got wrecked in a foreign country like Brazil and a hot chick tried to make out with me. I truly believe that she only made out with someone because her sister told me privately that was the case. I also hacked her email (which I’m ashamed of) and saw the email to her sister. I had lost some trust.

After that trip abroad for her, things were NOT that different. She got an internship in Dallas over the summer and we saw each other along the same schedule. I decided to stay at work until the end of her MBA program to give her the flexibility to search for a job where she wanted and we would move to that city together. I think it upset her slightly that I wasn’t moving out there when we had originally planned, but we were thinking about a move to a new city like San Fran or NYC after she graduated, and I didn’t want to jump ship from 2 jobs in one year.

 Things were starting to slow down in our sex life. She had stopped initiating. She was also denying a lot of my advances. I figured it was just the rigor of the long distance relationship, a 4 year lull, or the contrived nature of our intimacy because we only had a few days every 6 weeks to do it. It was like scheduled sexy time. Sometime she was on her period when I saw her and nothing could happen.  Once we were actually living together again, things would pick back up. I was sure of it. I spoke to her about it maybe once or twice and she just said that she didn’t have the sex drive that she used to. I asked her about birth control and she said that she couldn’t afford any other type on her schools’ med plan. I tried to try some different things like porn and a toy, but she didn’t really respond. She didn’t deny, just didn’t get excited about it.

Riley was nearing the end of her MBA program and I started asking questions about where she was looking for jobs, and what she wanted to do. She NEVER wanted to have this conversation. She would get really pissed. She started going out to the bars more and more because school was easy for her. I kept trying to press her gently for some direction on the next phase of our life but she just kept shrugging it off. I can’t tell you how frustrating this was for me. She had all of the control over my life AND her life because I had committed to her that I would move where she wanted to go. I was working rigorous hours, and she was going out on Wednesdays. I never confronted her about how unfair I felt she was being, and I wish I had now. 

Finally in May (after I did some assisting in her job search), she started gaining traction in the job market. I had been looking for jobs as well, just to see what was out there in case she wanted to move back to Atlanta. I was actively being headhunted by a firm in Atlanta. 

For the 4th of July, we went on a trip to Key West, which she suggested, to celebrate my taking of the 3rd and final Level of the CFA. We flew into Ft. Lauderdale to take the scenic drive down. I decided to splurge and get a convertible rental for the trip. She didn’t want me to spend any more money on her, she said. I wanted to do this, this was for me. She was adamant for me not to spend the extra money, but I did it anyway.  We had a great trip, and had sex twice, but she refused my other advances and said she wasn’t in the mood. I was disappointed because we hadn’t seen each other for 2 months, but I let it go.

During our trip she got an email request to go to a final interview for a firm in Dallas where she actually wanted the job. I was excited for her, but she just seemed down. I asked her what she was going to do if she got offered the job. Was she going to take it? Or move back to Atlanta with me? Or continue looking in other cities? She said that she couldn’t make a decision until she had the offer. I pressed her with a hypothetical situation, and she shut down like she did the previous few months. Didn’t want to talk about it. I again shrugged it off, and chalked it up to the fact that no one wants to talk about work on vacation. 
So vacation over, and we drive (4 HOURS BACK TO THE FLL AIRPORT). Her flight is before mine. I see her off at the gate and she tells me that she had an incredible time, loves me, and kisses me goodbye. I tell her good luck on her interview.

Her interview was 3 days after our trip. I waited to call her about the result until my drive home from work. She says that she got the job. GREAT! Before I can say “what’s next” she continues talking and says that she’s going to take the job in Dallas and she wants me to stay in Atlanta….whoa. WHAT? That doesn’t compute. Are you breaking up with me? To this day she has never said that she was breaking up with me when I’ve asked her directly. 

She goes on to describe that for a long time now, maybe a year; that she hasn’t felt sexually attracted to me. She said initially she wasn’t sure. She said that she thought her feelings would change but they haven’t. She also said that she’s been unhappy and very depressed for the last 6 months and she thinks that it’s because she couldn’t tell me these things. She was hysterically crying through all of this over the phone. I was in a living hell, this was not how the end of our time apart was supposed to be.

I asked her after all of this time, this effort, why couldn’t she tell me this in person when we were driving back to the airport not 3 days before? Or at any time? I couldn’t believe that she was hiding this from me for so long. That she felt so ashamed of her feelings that she couldn’t tell her best friend what was on her mind  (She still maintained that I was her best friend). She said she had been talking to her mom about her feelings and that she thought that she should end it now before we moved in together (our plan the since the day she left) She didn’t want me to move out to Dallas, uproot my life, and then she still feel the same way a few months from now and I’d be screwed.

I suggested to her that because she had never told me about her feelings before, that maybe she needed to take some time on it and see how she felt, now that it was in the open. Our conversation at that point was not being any more productive anyways. I told her goodbye.
I was hoping to let her think about it for at least 3 or 4 days. But she texted me at 11pm that night saying that she felt like she was making the biggest mistake of her life to give up on someone that she loved so much. I was so incredibly confused. I didn’t respond to her, and felt so sick that I didn’t go into work the next day. 

She called me the next day and I answered, stupidly. She said that she still felt the same way; that she needed to end it. First I told her that wasn’t really taking the time to think, but I made my case. 
I told her that our intimacy had been totally contrived for the last 2 years. That we could never be spontaneous as a couple because we had to plan our visits to see each other, and every time we went to each other’s city, we had an agenda. People who were friends with us wanted to hang out with us together. We also always tried to plan trips around a concert or event, so we were always scrambling to do things like a normal couple. I also told her that she had her own body image issues (which she expressed to me before), and that she was projecting her own image of her sexuality on me. I told her she hadn’t changed her birth control, nor consulted anyone about it to see if that was affecting her sex drive. I also implored to her that if she was really depressed, that she needed to talk to a professional. I couldn’t help her with that. I also told her that there was a serious communication issue between us that she internalized and never allowed us to work on together. She agreed with me, and that she would work on getting therapy set up so she could work on herself. 

I told her to take some real time to figure it out. I would wait. Please Riley, think about how much effort we’ve put in to this relationship to make it this far, and now you want to throw it all away before you even give it a chance again.

So she then proceeds to call me the next day and say “I’m not taking the job, and I want to move in with you in Atlanta” YES! I was so ecstatic that she was at least going to take me back that I didn’t think about the implications of her flip-flopping so much on her decisions. “Are you sure?”- I asked. “I can always find a job in a city, but I don’t want to regret the rest of my life losing something with you.”
I told her that we could start over when she moved in, clean slate. I was living in a 3-bedroom house at that point and I told her that we could sleep in separate rooms to start. That was the last of the discussions that we had about our relationship until after she moved in. Her sister drove her U-Haul over from Dallas, while Riley followed her in her car. Her sister had never been to Atlanta before, so I took 2 days off work to go do touristy things and help her move in. She brought everything with her. I mean EVERYTHING. She had a lot of crap. It made me feel really good that she going to be making a home with me. I was still scared though.

One night we went out to a bar and Riley went to the bathroom, her sister grabbed me aside and told me this: “I told Riley that she needs to get over her indecision and commitment issues with you. You are a great guy, and you’ve treated her, me, and the rest of my family so well. If this somehow doesn’t work out for you two, then you deserve someone much better.” I hate that this was a foreshadowing of what was to come. 

I failed to mention before that I had put in my 2 weeks’ notice at my firm of 5 years and I was offered 2 weeks of free time before my new employer needed me to start. This was perfect! Riley and I could take some time to figure out what’s gone wrong over the past few years, and figure the next step in our lives. Just take a vacation like we did a year before to the mountains and go hiking. Oh, and that same firm that offered her a job in Dallas? Well, guess what. They have an office in the building that I’m going to be working in, and that she can start with the Atlanta group in October!!!

So here we go. The Monday after my last day of work, her sister has left, and I have NOTHING to do.  It was like the most glorious morning of my life. I woke up, I had no obligations, and the love of my life was making breakfast for me and she had a job. But I knew that everything was too perfect. I knew that this feeling I had couldn’t last, somehow, I knew. We went to Crossfit that morning together and had a great workout and we decided we were going to go to this great sandwich spot that served Jack and Coke slushies and get hammered. I was putting my shoes on to leave and she said “I need to talk to you, do you want to talk now or after lunch?” ……Ummmmm.. how about now? Mind you, this girl has been moved into my house for 11 days. She’s put up her pictures on the wall. That’s about as far as she’s gotten. We’ve kissed a few times, but nothing else and have been sleeping in separate rooms.

“I still feel the same way. I’m just not sexually attracted to you anymore. I mean, you don’t have the greatest body, and neither do I, but I just don’t know how this is going to work if I can’t be intimate with you anymore. I love you, but I’m not in love with you and I don’t want to get married any time soon. I don’t even know if I’m the marrying type. I’ve changed over the last year. I want to be single again.”
I was in every sense of the word, dumbfounded. I told her that you didn’t even look into therapy, you didn’t try to express what you’d been feeling to me, in short, you did nothing! The very definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results! This was not making an effort to restart a relationship. She said that she couldn’t afford therapy and she didn’t want to take my money for it, she didn’t want to feel indebted to me any more than she already did (See the parallel for the convertible rental in Key West). I had paid for half of her U-Haul and the gas for the last leg of her drive out to my house. And her Crossfit membership. She didn’t say anything then. Her parents had divorced when she was 14, and since then had always had trouble with money. I think the control over her own finances was a deep-seated issue for her. She felt I was giving her charity, but I just wanted us to work. I was putting in the effort.

So I told her that I wasn’t going to try to change her mind anymore, and that if she wanted it this way, she could have it. She proceeded to ask me if she could stay at the house until a wedding that we were both invited to in October. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? Um, no. “I know, I don’t know why I asked because I know that it was selfish.” Whoa…Followed up with “Can you help me move out?” Um….no. I cried a little bit, was generally a bit pathetic, but I packed my bag to stay with my parents that night. I couldn’t look at ther. I hugged her and said goodbye on the front porch of my house and turned and didn’t look back as I drove away. That’s the last I’ve spoken to her. Her dad bought a ticket for the same sister to fly out on that Wednesday to Atlanta to rent a U-Haul and drive back. Her sister was pissed.

Those two nights at my parents I was in total shock/denial. It was so fucking weird that she was in MY house while I was at my parents. She texted me a few logistical things, and I wrote her an extremely long rambling e-mail (not unlike this post ) on Tuesday night basically chronicling the best times I had with her. I ended the e-mail by saying, I don’t know why I just wrote that, I guess I was hoping that I might say something that would change your mind. I guess I was all over the map. 

She wrote me back saying that she loved me and she missed me, but she need to do this. She wanted to see me before she left. That she knew she needed help at that she was going to get it. She said that I was the best part of her life over the past 5 years. WTF?!? I’m still lost to this day. She wrote me another handwritten letter and left it for me when I returned on Wednesday. It basically the same thing except with the addition that “Maybe we’ll find each other again someday” I think that’s way too out of the movies. Also, she said that she would still like it if I came to the wedding I discussed earlier, so she’ll be back in Atlanta in a few weeks.

Just a little bit of irony as I wind this down. My new company’s headquarters are in Dallas (A part of the reason I chose to leave my old company, in case she wanted to move back to Dallas to start a family in the future). That Thursday morning I had to fly out to HQ for their annual meeting so I could meet some people before I started work. So Riley had stayed in my house without me as she packed her things Monday through Wednesday. And then I flew to her hometown, literally over her head, on Thursday, as she was driving back. That flight was fucking terrible.

So now here I am. I haven’t texted or spoken to her for about 3 weeks. I unfriended her from facebook so I didn’t see any posts she may make. Her mom wrote me an email saying how sorry she was about everything, that she thinks the world of me and wished me the best. That hurt, I already thought of her as Mom. Her sister reiterated her feelings about her sister being a dumbass. It’s embarrassing for me to have to tell everyone that she moved out after I told everyone that she moved in. I had even planned a surprise party for her that I had to cancel. It hurts every time I have to have that conversation.

I’m depressed, and I’m thinking about seeking help. I want to get established in my job over the next week or so, and then I’ll start looking in to it. I don’t know what the next step in my life is, and I don’t like it. I feel like someone stole my best friend, and that my best friend betrayed me all at the same time. Riley and I have so much in common. She’s the only girl I know that will go to a Phish concert, a Tool concert, Bonnaroo, kick the soccer ball in the park after drinking scotch and water, and take all of Sunday to sit down and watch the RedZone channel all day while talking Fantasy Football shit. Oh, and she’s hot.

Reddit, what have I done for the past 4 years? Am I doing the right thing now? Will she ever come back? When should I call her, or should I let her call me? I want to get over her and I don’t. Any comments? Thank you all so much if you could stand my incredibly self-centered post. I think that getting this all down on paper has helped me.

**TL;DR** Guy meets girl at work. Guy is fat, girl is not. Guy starts losing weight when girl kicks his but into gear. Guy falls in love, but girl keeps him in the friend zone. Guy and girl become best friends. Guy gets out of the friend zone. Girl says she may not be ready for a relationship. Guy and girl get into a great relationship anyways. Girl gains some weight. Girl says she wants to marry the guy, and guy feels the same. Guy and girl hate their job, and girl decides to get an MBA in a different city. Guy stays at job after promotion. Girl moves away. Guy loses more weight. Girl kisses a foreign guy, guy forgives her. Girl starts becoming more distant towards the end of her schooling. Girl can’t make a decision on where she wants to work or live. Guy presses her for this, and she gets more distant. Girl gets a job in her hometown. Girl wants to end it. Guy asks her to try to make it work and get counseling. Girl moves to guys hometown. Girl moves out after 11 days.

zwgnz,0,2012-09-14,"I was offered an internship that I think is a scam, but I'm not entirely sure. What does AskReddit think?",Milk_Bread_Eggs,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zwgnz/i_was_offered_an_internship_that_i_think_is_a/,"A while ago I sent my resume to a company called [Client Acquisitions Group](http://www.clientac.com/), or CAG. I found them on Craigslist [here](http://denver.craigslist.org/ofc/3262716745.html). 


They claimed to be offering an internship that was based around introducing myself to C-Suite Level executives.  If I was able to pursued these executives to meet with Clients from CAG, then I would receive a fee after sitting in on the meeting as an intern and reporting back to CAG what occurred. 

The first big red flag was that he said all of this would only take an hour a day and that I would need to do it from my home. I was able to find their office as listed in their articles of incorporation, and it's a small door with a mail slot with a sign that says Client Acquisitions Group (although the sign outside the building says Spangrud and Associates) in a large generic multi-office building. I'm guessing that's the reason why he wanted to meet at a  Starbucks.

He said that he wanted me to call 20 Executives a week and expected a 20% hit rate (so 4 meetings). When I questioned the success rate, he rationalized that the messages were tailored specifically to these CEOs (the goal being that they would use my status as a current student at the CEO's alma mater. This, I believe, is the ultimate goal: to have several interns from several schools using their status to get introductions).

He mentioned that if I could make 3 meetings a week happen, then I could be making up to $375/week.  What is even weirder is that he wants to pre-pay me for the first two meetings. 

During the interview he hardly asked me any questions about myself, and talked at length about his successful careers in sales (particularly the drug Adderal). 

When I mentioned that this sounded like Lead Generation, he sternly corrected that it was to be referred to as ""Opportunity Generation"", which was another red flag. 

The final thing would be that I wouldn't be working as part of Executive Tree, a separate company from Client Acquisitions Group, but I can't find any trace of this company. He said he would be using an off hands approach so I would be left alone to call these executives (which kinda defeats the purpose of an internship).

I'm pretty sure that according to the Fair Labor Standards Act that this doesn't qualify as an internship, but since they're technically paying me I don't know what the guide lines would be. 

So, what do you think, Reddit? Scam or Not?

I work 2 jobs and a freelance video editing one. Overall I have been working since I was 15 and have always had a job. I want to try to get internships, however a silly question but it seems intimating and I do not know how or where to ask. I feel like I am too young to start. 

My major question is, now what? Besides staying in school what is something I should be doing right now that will make me more valuable on the market?

I got a job earlier this week as a Statistician with the Census Bureau, I start at the end of this month. Nothing has been mentioned anywhere about a drug test, but being the government, I'm sure there will be one. And after I've filled that cup up, I'll be even more stoked for the next visit I make to my buddies back home. Still sucks that I'm in a big-ass city and have no idea how to find reliable green, but I suppose it'll fall in my lap eventually.

The worst part is the dreams/nightmares! I never dreamed about smoking until I had to quit for an extended amount of time. Usually I take a hit or two, and then immediately regret it in the dream because I've messed up my situation. But the most recent one I had, after having learned I got the job, I actually, painfully refused to take the hit, even with people trying to persuade me otherwise.

Sorry if this is too much text for text-fridays :) You should have stopped to take a smoke break halfway through!

How can I / Should I explain this to employers?",JodumScrodum,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/zw6ke/very_depressed_senior_year_of_college_greatly/,"My senior year of college (Mechanical Engineering student) I had a very rough year. At the start of the semester, I began to get clinically depressed. It got worse as the year went on, and because of it I really fell behind on my studies. I was so miserable I could barely study for exams, do any of my homework, or pay attention in class. I would study for midterms the night before some of my exams that year when in semester past I would stay as much as a week before.

I worked very hard my first 3 years. My GPA was about a 2.8 Junior year, which isn't bad but I had spent a lot of time on the Formula SAE team which took up a lot of my time. At the end of Senior year I had about a 2.3 for the whole year, and it really hurt my overall to like a 2.67

The thing is it bothers me that I worked so very hard the first three years, trying to set myself up for the best career I could get and to be the best engineer I could be. In just one year it really messed me up. 

I know many people can have tough times in school, to the point where it really impacts their studies. That is very sad to me, because you can't go back and make up for those mistakes, its in-graded on your transcript and resume. 

So basically what I want to know, is that is there anything someone can do to possibly inform an employer about the problems you had. GPA is just the main thing that gets hurts but a problem like mine, and GPA is one thing many employers look at (although I understand each employer looks at GPA differently). I don't want to be in the job interview of my life, and they turn me down because my GPA is a little too low for them, because I had such a difficult senior year. Experiencing something like that would eat me alive for a long time. 


edit: I'm here for one more semester, so I'm going to do as well as I can with my classes. The course load is not too bad. I might try and get some type of internship, or I could it would be an externship in the spring to get some type of experience. "

zw0u6,61,2012-09-14,90 Days ✔ - My one tip: LOCATION,holdmykeysimgoingin,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/zw0u6/90_days_my_one_tip_location/,"**Background**

So I finally did NoFap and NoPorn together for 90 days, thanks a lot to you guys. Non-sticky high fives for everyone!

I used to be a chronic fapper, 2-3 times a day for at least two years during high school, and they were all with the aid of porn…a recipe for disaster. So it wasn't very easy quitting. Social anxiety, depression, Nice Guy Syndrome, etc. made me try this challenge.

Since I started, I've had multiple attempts of less than a week, then 17 days, then 24 days, 77 days, and now finally 90 days and going. When you fail at your NoFap streak, you have 3 choices: you can either let it define you, destroy you, or strengthen you, so choose wisely. I was so pissed when I lost at 77 days, but I identified my triggers (watching Game of Thrones all by myself at home haha) and made sure not to do that again, and now here I am at Day 90. Don't let your setbacks set you back.

---

**Tip: Location, Location, Location!**

I've noticed my urges are different depending on where I am. They are the strongest when I'm at home, probably because of all the fun I had during those high school days. I see my old desk and immediately think of hitting command-shift-n in Chrome (yes I'm a Mac). Once you fap in a location, you immediately create triggers in that environment. You are building a habit of fapping in that location. Your location affects the way you think!

I owe a lot of the success of these 90 days to my summer internship 3000 miles away from home. I made an effort in the beginning not to fap, so as to not create a habit, and the two and a half months literally flew by with barely any urges. It almost felt as if I was cheating at NoFap. There was no huge fight, no struggle where I had to dig deep down inside and see what I was made of, nothing grand and inspiring. I just didn't fap. Nothing in my room reminded me of fapping since I had never done it, so I didn't have many urges. It just worked. It's actually a struggle for me to even visualize myself fapping in that room. I'm not sure where I would put my laptop. Would I be on my knees or sitting in a chair? I would probably have to turn the volume down, pull down the blinds, and lock the door. Is there anything else I would have to do? However once you do fap even ONCE, you have a strong visualization and that makes fapping a second time MUCH easier. To those of you going to college and living in dorms, I urge you not to create a habit in this new change of scenery.

I also think this is why things like going for a walk and going to the gym are so helpful. You remove yourself from your location, and thus you literally change your thoughts. The urges just float away. If you find that most of your urges come when you're in your room or in your house (and I guarantee you this is probably a place you have fapped before), go to a different room or go to a library to get your work done.

---

**Results**

I think most of the results people get from NoFap are based on what they choose to do with their time when distracting themselves from fapping. For me, this was going to the gym. As a result I'm quite toned now and have received at least 4 compliments on my pecs the last couple weeks. I also opened up to people a lot more and spent my time interacting with others. The social anxiety is still not completely gone, but I am FAR more functional as a person now than before.

Also since I was in a new town for my summer internship, I was out exploring a lot, meeting new people, trying new things. All that really helped me build a lot of character.

Another thing I have noticed is that I have no approach anxiety now. I do tend to sometimes get awkward into the conversation, but as far as the initial approach, I am fearless in going up to a person and starting to talk to them.

As far as the sexual results, I am now able to summon the beast just solely by my thoughts. Whereas before only the perfect video at the perfect point with the perfect touch could make me achieve this. It's empowering to know that I am in full control of my buddy down under."

I recently graduated from university with a B.S. degree in chemistry (3.2 GPA). I was under qualified for the positions that seemed intellectually engaging (They were looking for 2-5 yrs exp).


I have a couple years doing research in a lab as well as graduate level coursework under my belt. The job market was not good and I got low balled in a couple of job offers ($10/hr). I made $15/hr at an internship that I worked to pay off school.

My friend went into a sales position and I followed. I have been making $750 a week after taxes. I just don't see it building/ amounting to the greatness that I would like. It has only been a couple months, but I don't have any belief that it has any reason to change. 


I don't like randomly going to bars, or anything. I can be charismatic and charming, but it just seems hopeless. The sheer number of people I churn through. Mostly, I meet people, chat them up, exchange numbers and never talk to them again. I don't want to go out. I would rather sink into the void and drink booze. For company, I was contemplating hiring prostitutes, but that doesn't sound like it would be fiscally responsible, or sound. 


 I live with my parents to save money while I am trying this sales thing out and contemplate going back to graduate school. I don't see myself moving out anytime soon because my income is not stable enough to justify it. Renting somewhere would just be burning money.


I don't know. It just seems pointless. Suicide doesn't seem viable. I would much rather just do self destructive things (smoke cigarettes, drink copiously, do drugs, eat unhealthy). I might just try to make myself the best I can be and just deal with being alone.


My parents don't have any friends. I figure it makes sense because they are the ones that raised me, so that is my destiny."

zvtvy,1,2012-09-14,Recovery,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/zvtvy/recovery/,"This is my first post here, lurked a while but have never actually contributed.  After I graduated high school and went off to a university in 2010 I started this toxic behavior.  I didn't care and missed out on so much until the middle of my sophomore year when I moved back home.  1.5 years is all it took to screw myself.  Going into college I was an honor student/rugby player/part of the AFROTC to join the Air Force after college.  I was also dating the same girl out of high school for 2 and a half years.  All of that went down the drain with masturbation.  I put on a good 35 lbs, dropped AFROTC, and lost my scholarship with my 2.0 gpa and my relationship was starting to fall apart as I stopped caring.  


I moved back home in December of 2011 to go to the local college so I wouldn't have to pay rent and make it easier on myself.  I was so depressed looking at myself and realizing that I had so much potential and almost literally pissed it all away.


On January 15th 2012 I met up with an old friend from high school.  He is a brilliant guy and goes to one of the top universities in the US.  He told me that he was going blind in that where most people have peripherals he can only see directly in front of him and his vision should be completely gone in 5 years or so.  He told me that even though this is the case, he isnt going to let himself get down about it because there is nothing he can do.  He should be graduating in two more years with an engineering degree (I dont recall exactly what type) and has already had multiple offers for internships at our home air force base.  This had to be one of the single greatest motivators seeing someone start with something less than what I have surpass most everyone I know.  I started working out and found myself feeling better right away, yet I knew it wasn't enough.  I started to do research on what I wanted out of life but still didn't know.  A few months later a friend introduced me to reddit and the first thing I see on the front page was the TED talk about masturbation.  I looked into this sub and found so much information.  


It's now 9 months after the fact and I have lost 45 lbs, my relationship is better than ever, I'm in the process of trying to get into the USMA at the moment, helping out with a local high school football team, and school is going great.  So I just wanna say thank you /r/nofap, you guys are awesome.  I've one again had to reset my badge, but hopefully its the last time.  

**tldr- you guys have helped me realize what I want out of life and how I need to get there.  Thanks for everything.**  "

My assignment over the semester is a project about Syria and Lebanon which is to culminate into a fairly large booklet (around 100 pages) and a 2 to 3 hour workshop.  The audience will be teachers from various schools looking to learn about the 2 countries since they're not covered much in textbooks and they're really important in light of recent events.  I should also include ways they can get the information across to their students.

I'm supposed to create a ""portrait"" of the countries (general info, culture, demographics, politics, relations with the rest of the middle east/world, history, ethnic groups, possibilities are limitless) including their past, present, and potential future.  I'm fairly familiar with the region, studied it for a few years and the fact that my parents are from there.  

I'm not completely helpless on this project, I just want to see if there's anything I've missed or should consider. I've been doing research for a few weeks now, I'm just wondering if anybody has any interesting sources that I may have not come across.  There are a lot of different narratives for what's going across the region, I want to cover all of it but still abstain from being political.  If you don't have any sources, let me know if there's anything you think I should make sure to cover.  

I'm sure you guys here this a lot, but this is also my first time posting on Reddit after lurking for a month or two, hopefully I'll get more involved in the community.  I'm not exactly sure how this works so I'll go ahead and post it.  I can give more info about the project if anybody would like it.  Thanks for all your help!

I'd like to thank everyone again for putting up with me when I just started out.  I'm now up to 2 pistols and a .22 rifle, and am looking to go a little bigger.

For ""serious"" rifle calibers, from my limited research it seems that an AR15 would be great from a budget perspective due to 5.56 and .223 being rather cheap.  This would most likely NOT be a hunting gun, so I'd be fine with that caliber.  Seems like it's sort of the 9mm of rifle cartridges, would that be an adequate comparison?

On the other hand, there's the Mosin, which I could pick up at a gun show next month.  Seems like it's a no-brainer, and I've quite enjoyed shooting my friend's.  Are there any other, lesser-known ""great buys"" that I should be aware of?

I'm a college student, so ammo costs are of concern (it's the main reason I'll have to skip getting a 1911 for now, since 9mm exists...).  That's where the AR platform seems to have its drawbacks.

Lastly, can anyone link me to some great reading material or even forums regarding rifles?  I'm sort of getting lost with all the calibers/manufacturers etc., which didn't seem to be a problem when I first started looking into handguns.  I currently read The Firing Line and The High Road.

As always, thank you gunnit!

Oh, I almost forgot.  I'm currently working a programming/research internship, and decided to live at home until the Spring semester to save up as much money as possible to get me the rest of the way through college.  Now my mother only allows me to have my .22 rifle in the house, she doesn't even know that I carry (I guess that's why they call it concealed carry ;)).  It's a stupid situation to get myself into in the first place, but do any of you have any advice on how to deal with it?  I somewhat recently started introducing my father to shooting and he loves it, but my mother wears the pants rather decisively, so he probably won't be much help.


Thanks, and sorry for the novel.

These were not little mistakes, they were serious flaws that WILL cause trouble in the future and end up costing the company a substantial amount of money. 

I gave my boss a long list of all the issues I saw in the current applications and he just laughed at me. He said, ""You shouldn't care about good design, just follow the design document you were provided. Even if you know the design is bad.""

I thought that was crazy and that no one else in the office could think the same thing. I asked around and it seemed everyone had the same sentiment. I shouldn't care about the design, I should just follow orders. Note: This is not just because I'm an intern. My boss is tells that to everyone.

Needless to say, I am scared about my future here at the company. I want to get out of here as soon as I can.

What are some red flags you've seen in a job that made you realize you needed to get out of there?

**EDIT:** Thanks for all your responses. I still have a lot to learn in my field. My boss just came and talked with me about the list I provided him. He said after he looked at the list, he thinks they are a serious issue and we should fix most of them. No idea what caused his sudden change of heart."
zvmim,1,2012-09-14,"Never in a million years could I see myself posting here. See no future, no alternatives, I don't want to, but I feel like I have no choice.",cantthinkofanything7,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/zvmim/never_in_a_million_years_could_i_see_myself/,"Nobody can know who I am. Please don't try to figure it out; it's probably possible. 

I graduated in May summa cum laude from a top 30 school. I grew up (and live in) a very wealthy town, and there was always something very ""special"" about me, yadda yadda yadda. 

So I go into college, destroy shit. Everyone talks about how great I am. I'm an amazing writer. I produce the type of work people expect out of students at Ivy League advanced degree programs. I have a lot of friends who care about me, which wasn't really true in high school. I loved college. I wrote an amazing Senior Thesis even though I shattered my collarbone in the middle of writing it and had to type with one hand. Everyone told me I should drop out and graduate a semester late, but I powered through it and got all As that last semester. 

Now I can't get a job. The job ""search"" been the most dehumanizing, degrading process in which I've been involved (including being ""initiated"" by a sports team and having to lick a used dildo) and I've felt sick the past few months. Not sick at myself, because I know I'm doing everything right. Sick at the country and sick at other people. 

I made it to the final round at a prestigious med-tech company for a position paying $65k out of college. They told me during the interview that I seemed like a great fit. I killed it at the interview and thought I was guaranteed a job. Two weeks later: rejected, and they wouldn't tell me why. Because of privacy. Whatever that means.

While that was devastating, I don't give up easily. I got to another final round interview for a consulting job at a Top 50 consulting firm and was asked a ridiculous case study question. The answer to the case was demeaning and unfair, and everyone I've spoken to agrees with me. Unsurprised and unruffled when they rejected me. 

This was all during the summer, and now it's fall. I can't find anything. I send out 50 applications a week, and nobody even responds to me. I do everything right. I try to network, and everyone tries to help. I've spoken with 100 alumni so far, and each phone call is the same. They gush over my resume, and then tell me that their company isn't hiring. Sometimes, when there is a position, they personally hand my resume and cover letter to HR, which is pretty much the best thing possible when applying for jobs. Doesn't matter, I don't hear anything back.

I don't want to see my friends anymore because I'm too embarrassed about not having a job. I can't sleep because I just dream about being offered jobs and actually being happy. My career counselor started crying while she was speaking with me because she felt so bad for me and couldn't understand why I wasn't getting interviews. 

I've felt myself become racist. If I weren't a white male, I would have a job now. I blame affirmative action. I'm becoming a cynical asshole. I used to be interested in learning, but now I don't care anymore. I regret picking my college (even though I loved it), my major (loved it), and my internships (loved them). 

For some reason, I can't get myself to apply to a post-grad internship. Money isn't the problem. I'm a very moral person (not my moral compass being amazing, just that I consider the ethics of every action I make), and I can't let myself apply. The thought of working for free contributing to an economy which hates me is a thought that makes me sick. 

I no longer want to contribute to the US economy because I don't believe in the country anymore. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't see what other choice I have. I'm the hero this country deserves, not the one it needs. :)

I don't want to go quietly. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I want to destroy something important. Some action to make everyone realize that this country is not OK, is not safe, and does not offer the opportunity it promises. I've given myself until November 1 to find a job. 

Tell me I'm a fucking dipshit. Don't tell me I'm smart and admirable and worthy, because that's what everyone has told me my entire life.

zvm8e,18,2012-09-14,For all you job hunters out there...,petraman,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/zvm8e/for_all_you_job_hunters_out_there/,"I've had multiple posts in this sub about the pains of finding a job as a recent graduate, which has really brought me down in the past couple months.  It almost seemed like I'd never get a job, especially in this economy...  However, a trip to a job fair last week gave me a ton of insight on how to get a job as a recent grad.  This would probably apply to others as well.

Positivity goes SUCH a long ways when it comes to getting a job.  An employer can easily see the lack of self confidence and negativity present in a prospective employee.  If you don't have self confidence, you'll never be able to defend and sell yourself to your full potential.  So, maybe you're thinking ""well screw you, I'm not a positive guy, how am I supposed to do that?""  Well, we are a pony sub after all...  Go watch ponies!  Listen to happy music before a job fair!  Dream about all the great interviews you'll get and pump yourself up!  Go into it thinking that the world is your oyster and you're just about to open it up and find the pearl inside.

Look at your weaknesses and find a way to twist them into positives.  For example, I don't have an internship, which in engineering is a big no-no and is hard to get around.  However, I've gotten around it twice at the job fair yesterday, and it was pretty easy to do so.  Instead of focusing on the internship, I focused on my other strengths.  How my leadership experiences running clubs and forums have helped shape me not just for the short-term, but for the long-term as well.  Also, think about why the employers are worried about a weakness and what you can substitute as a defense for that weakness which will make you stand out.  Have a bad GPA?  Instead of focusing on that, focus on the courses you did well in and how that would apply to the company.

Also, makes sure you look at the SMALLER companies.  Sure, they may not be dream jobs, but they can certainly lead to them.  They're more accepting and personal and, from the people I've talked to, a lot of them are much better to work for just starting out.  A lot of larger companies treat you like a number just starting out...  and smaller companies would be much more willing to learn about YOU instead of just your GPA and internship work.

Look into the companies you're looking at and do some research.  Mention that research in your cover letters or when you're talking to them at career fairs so that you seem interested.  Also, ask a LOT of questions about the position.  Interest in the position perks the ears of HR up, since they know you're serious about working there.

You can do it.  I have faith in you.  All you need is positivity and a new outlook on your job search.  Sure, I might not have a job yet, but I'm now confident that I can find something in the near future because I know what I can provide to a company.  Good luck!"

I am currently writing my Master's thesis which will end on September 30th. Thus not much time left. Anyway, all goes well imho. Afterwards I will leave Germany (I'm German) for approx. 6 months to visit Australia and do a 4 weeks internship there. Afterwards the time has come to make the call whether I should start a PhD or search for a job somewhere else. The problem is, I'm working at a Fraunhofer Institute for 3 years now as a research assistant and got an offer to do my PhD there when I'm back from Australia. Sounds quite nice yeah, but the problem I have is that there aren't barely any other bioinformaticians. There is a friend of mine who had switched after his Bachelor in Bioinformatics into It-economy studies such that he has not the level as I have. 
The group leader I am currently working with told me that he will have a doctoral adviser for me from another university (which may be someone with a chair in Vienna or Zurich) but I am not very confident about the communication and stuff. Sure in times of skype, ventrilo, E- mail etc. there is always a way to get in contact with someone but somehow I fear the point where I have a problem I can't solve on my own (and I am sure this problem will raise over time) and nobody is there to help me out! The group I am working in are almost molecular biologist only a few have proper understanding in what's going on in CS or bioinformatics at all. So what is your opinion? Is it advisable to start a PhD there ?


tl;dr: I'm working in an almost biologist lab and got an offer to do my bioinformatics PhD there without a real other bioinformatician in the same lab. Shall I accept?

I just came back from a screening of about 20 films directed by New York Film Academy students. There were very few projects that were decent (that I could actually show a friend who watches regular TV/films). I don't know if should say good, because we are talking about a graduate program.

Anyway, this isn't a rant specifically directed at NYFA. This is a message to people interested in film making and thinking about going to school:
Request to see the whole reel from the last graduating year. Not just the good ones that the school will put forward. If you see something that is so incredibly bad that it shouldn't even exist, then the school is probably not doing its job.

In my opinion, many of the students who directed shorts screened today should have been told either during the writing phase, or many years ago, that they were heading in the wrong direction. Dead wrong.

This is typical of film schools though. I split my education between 3 schools (and internships). Only one teacher ever made classes read scripts, and told his students that their writing was complete shit. It was harsh, but it was true. Many, including me, improved dramatically from it.

End of rant. Spend your money and your time wisely.

I am looking at a few internships in India (in particular in Gurgaon, Haryana and another in Jodhpur) and had a few questions I hoped you could all answer a bit more impartially than the employers might be inclined to answer. 

One internship is offering $350 USD/month (~19k IR), and the one in Jodhpur is offering around $200 USD/month (~11k IR) with them paying for my accommodations and food. With that in mind, what kind of accommodations might I expect to be able to afford or be put up in, and how comfortable might I expect to be? Would I be able to go out with co-workers on Saturday nights and not feel too strapped for cash?

Second, does that sound like a fair wage? One internship is doing social media with a clothing company, the other will be working for a luxury food and beverage group recruiting clients, doing marketing, etc.

I gave Jury Duty reps a call and ask the person about this he said my question doesn't make sense and began to get frustrated. I'm assuming its because they get a lot of calls where people try to find a way out of doing it. My question was basically how am I supposed to know if I'm able to report that week if I have not been given the time I need to report? There are days and times I know that I'm available, but what if it falls during the hours of the internship. How should I respond regarding if I can report. What if I say I can report, but then end up not being able to because of a scheduling conflict? Will I be penalized? 

The bigger issue is this would technically be the best week to do it since school hasn't begun yet and if I reschedule between now and the end of the year it will be even more likely to conflict. Being that having work or being a full-time student is not an excuse that would be even more inconvenient for me. Can anyone provide any insight?

Also, why is it so inconvenient? Why can't that give a reporting day and time instead of week and provide the day at the last minute?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Thanks for doing this Rep. Ellison!  I am one of your constituents (Fightin' 5th!\) and am wondering how much the political landscape has changed in the last 10 years since you took office in the MN house and then the US house.  I voted for you in 2006 and remember how much attention you got when you swore in using a Qur'an.  Are people still making a big deal out of your religion?  Has it been difficult to get people focus on the issues, like social benefits and tax policy reform, because of your diverse background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lvrk?context=5)|Thanks for the question. Things have changed a lot since i began serving in Congress. We're out of Iraq, which is one of the issues I campaigned on. We have a Health Care law that will offer great benefits to people. When I started, it was only a hope.  We went thru a massive financial collapse, and then passed major reform.  When I started in Congress, I never dreamed GM and Chrysler would fail. not only did they fail, the American people picked them back up, and now both are hiring and thriving. When I entered Congress, Obama was an IL state legislator. Now he's President. Also, perhaps most threatening, Citizens United became the law of the land, and it's perverting our politics in a way none of us have ever seen before. So, many changes have occurred. At the end of the day, one thing remains the same: for working Americans to have a better quality of life, we have to organize, come together, and call for a new politics of inclusion and generosity.  
[Do you feel that, as a Muslim, you and your family are watched more closely by your local media?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lotn?context=5)|No, i feel that my family and i have been treated with respect and fairness. i know many people who have reported unfair treatment, and disrespectful treatment, but that has not been my experience. also, in cases where there has been bigoted or hateful treatment, interfaith groups have stepped forward. for example. when Terry Jones protested in Dearborn to incite against the Muslim community there, a multitude of people of all faiths stood and said ""no.""  so, thanks for asking and please go out and build interfaith understanding.
[I was at OccupyMN and remember seeing you visit the plaza. Would you agree or disagree with this statement ""Money Out Of Politics""? and generally would you support the freedom to protest in the plaza again this year in the same manner? (Will we see you again this year if there is another large turnout at the plaza?\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67mb2x?context=5)|Yes, we need to get money out of politics. Let's do a Constitutional Amendment to overturn Citizen United. And also, let's publicly fund campaigns. In the meantime, let's pass Disclose Act; so, at least we know who's messin' with our elections. I really admire those Move to Amend guys. Sure, I will be happy to hang with the people on the plaza again. 
[What was it like to be on Colbert's Better know a District?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lrz3?context=5)|Colbert is a cut-up, isn't he? It was really fun doing the ""Better Know a District"". Before we started, Colbert leaned into me and said ""I'm about to become a very different guy"". He was right. Real fun. 
[Is it difficult for you to interact with Rep. Bachmann on a personal level due to her repeated insinuations of ""Islamic infiltration"" of our country and her many demeaning and ignorant comments?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67m0lk?context=5)|No. no personal problems. 
[What was it like taking oath on Thomas Jefferson's Quran?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67mjsq?context=5)|Fun. inspiring. weighty. 
[As an absentee Uptown voter, thank you.  Question: Do you think debt reduction is important, and what, if any, measures would you support?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lyh3?context=5)|Yes, debt reduction is very important. The real issue is how to address it. In the short term, it's more important to get people working. I prefer a major public works program, especially given that we have trillions in unmet infrastructure needs for schools, bridges, power grids, and transmission lines.  But we have a long term debt problem, and it will take a combination of spending cuts and new revenue to fix it.  Dramatic cuts now would cause the loss of public sector workers which increases unemployment.  Four features of any sensible debt reduction: invest in jobs to get more taxpayers to help shrink the debt, increase revenue by closing loopholes and asking the most well-to-do to do a little more, defense must share in the cuts, and finally protect social security, medicare, and medicaid.

[Do you support ending the drug war and Federal intrusion of medical marijuana? If so, what have you done to advance this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67mfez?context=5)|Yes, drug war was always the wrong framing. Let's get rid of mandatory minimum sentencing requirements, crack-cocaine sentencing disparity, etc. i have voted and organized to emphasize public safety over simple retribution, and have argued for a greater role for mental and chemical health.
[What is your view on Citizens United? How do you feel about corporate donations, money, and lobbying in politics, esp in the Presidential campaign? And how many other members share your thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67m24j?context=5)|Citizen United is bad bad bad. let's repeal it. see earlier answer.

What is your favorite pizza place in the Twin Cities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lqq7?context=5)|Pizza Luce all day. yum yum. staff likes it too. chicken pineapple anyone?

[The recent push for Voter ID laws both in Minnesota and around the country worries me. It seems like a clear effort to disenfranchise people who would be most likely to vote for democrats (or DFL\). Are you worried about this phenomenon? Do you think democrats will have more trouble in the future if these laws are passed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67m8a1?context=5)|Yes, i am worried about the ballot measure that would put a MN government issued photo ID requirement into the constitution. It would hurt thousands in MN and wouldn't help anything. The massive voter fraud claim is a fraud. But we can still win this. Spread the word. Tell people it's trick to steal their voice. 
[I've been listening and reading about the embassy attacks, and a recurring theme seems to be expressing to Libyans (and other Islamic majority nations\) the concept of democratic freedom of expression.  In your opinion, what would be an effective way the U.S. as a whole and the government could educate those countries on the concept of these freedoms and why they are a cornerstone for free nations? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67mnn1?context=5)|Freedom of expression has historic reference in the middle east. point folks to examples of free expression in their own tradition and urge them to embrace them. Also, respectfully discuss how in the U.S. we have all colors, all cultures, and all faiths, and how, yes, there are problems here too from time to time, but by an large we live together peacefully.

[–]onthestorm 32 points 1 hour ago
OK, enough people (even personal emails) asked me to come by. I'll take any excuse to procrastinate from writing.

1. Nope. Unless you count that the last season I started dating one of the show's production assistants (the showbiz equivalent of an intern). We were together for 7 years.
Although, I will say that when she was guest starring on the show, I was in love with Linda Cardellini. She thought I was too young for her. Boo.

2. Bill Daniels. Jesus, I'm joking. No one was an asshole.

3. ABC and the show runners decided that there were too many other shows in our demographic with ""nerd"" characters (Urkel, etc.). So they went a different direction.

4. Yep. We got to the point where we barely had to rehearse -- acting with Ben became like having a psychic twin.

5. Maybe, but I guess I don't think there's much point in dwelling on it.
But you're kind of perpetuating the assumption behind your question by not asking what we're up to nowadays.
I'll tell you anyway. ;)
Danielle has been doing a lot of hosting (The Dish) while going to college, and is now doing an MSN show called Last Night on TV: http://tv.msn.com/last-night-on-tv/ She's on twitter here: https://twitter.com/daniellefishel
Ben went to Stanford and is now doing indie films and writing. He is also on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BenSavage
Will is the king of voice over work. Currently, he's Lion-o on Thundercats (he's also writing for the show).
I'm having dinner with Danielle tonight. Maybe we'll post a photograph.
-Rider

Assuming this is Danielle because of her tweet.

DanielleFishel 5 points 10 minutes ago

Okay, got a lot of requests for this from twitter! Rider and I are going to start a thread together later but for now, I thought I'd answer these questions.

1. I dated Matthew Lawrence for a little bit when we worked together but other than that, we all felt like family. I did have a crush on every single one of those boys at one time or another though. How could I not?!

2. Honestly no one was an asshole. Even all of the guest stars we had were fun, cool, easy to get along with people. If there was any ""asshole drama,"" I wasn't aware of it.

3. I don't know for sure but I think they just wanted to get away from the classic nerdy character thing we had going. Topanga also became more and more mainstream as time went by.

4. Rider and Ben were always good friends. Watching them act in scenes together is one of my favorite memories. Seeing them put together the boy band dance they used to do every week for the live audience was even better! ""Backstreets back, alright!!"" I laugh just thinking about it.

5. I don't think my career has suffered, per se. I wouldn't have a career w/o BMW and Topanga so I won't ever complain. Do I think it's hard for people to accept us as anything other than the roles we played on the show? Yes. But I'm just happy people even care after all these years. :)

P.S. Make sure you follow Rider on twitter (@onthestorm). He is incredibly smart, talented, and funny. The work he is doing now (writing, directing) is exceptional and he also has amazing book recommendations. Click on his links when he posts them...check out what he's doing now. You'll be happy to know that it's just as awesome as what he did on BMW."
zuune,1,2012-09-13,I submitted a rather unconventional internship application but didn't get the response I was looking for. What should I do?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zuune/i_submitted_a_rather_unconventional_internship/,"Hi /r/jobs, I need some advice. I was (and still am) very interested in interning at Bad Robot (JJ Abrams production company in LA). From the little information I could find on the internship, they said they were looking for ""creative"" interns. So what did I do? I made a ""creative"" internship application specifically for them. You can view it here: [http://badrobot.zachboth.com](http://badrobot.zachboth.com)

I sent the application to their jobs email address Wednesday morning. Then, I sent it to a mid-level executive who's email I found online (and who works with the interns a lot). About an hour later I get an email from the exec saying:

&gt;Thank you for reaching out.  We'll review your resume and let you know if we'd like to schedule an interview.

Very cut and dry. And from looking at my site analytics, no one visited the site, which means he probably shot off that quick email and then closed the email I sent without looking at the site. So fast forward a day, I'm kinda freaking out that no one from the company will see the application (that I probably spent way too much time creating) and my emails will be lost in the black hole that is the HR department. In my head, he was going to open up my email, check out the site, be super impressed, send it to everyone else in the office and I would be talking on the phone with JJ Abrams later that night (I know, highly unlikely... but my wishful thinking gets the best of me sometimes haha).

So I guess my questions are:

* Am I overreacting (considering it's been less than 48 hours since I sent it to them)?

* How long do I need to wait before I follow up on my submission?

* HOW do I follow up on my submission?

* Should I be trying to send this to anyone else in the company or should I let this play out?

* Am I a complete idiot for putting all my eggs in one basket?

* What's your honest opinion of the application?

Anyways, thanks /r/jobs for letting me vent. Hopefully some of you have some good thoughts/ideas on my situation.

EDIT: Sorry for writing a damn novel here."
zuuim,1,2012-09-13,Junior in college going for Finance Degree,flskimboarder592,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/zuuim/junior_in_college_going_for_finance_degree/,As I stated in the title I'm a junior in college and going for a Finance degree. I was just looking for advice in what to do in these later years of college that can prepare me well for the future. I'm starting to look for internships so I can get my foot in the door that way.

Would some of you recommend that I go into Finance or Accounting? I really like math and numbers.

zuu5f,9,2012-09-13,Work now or get a PhD?,Throwaway-PHD,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zuu5f/work_now_or_get_a_phd/,"Hi Reddit, 

I am currently pondering whether I should start working after finishing my MA-Thesis or if I should enroll for another (approximately) 3 years in a PhD program. 

First some information on me, then on my degree and university and then on some of my strengths and weaknesses. 

My questions are in the end, and I hope that people with more experience can help me out with their opinions. I also asked friends, but those also trying to get a PhD are in different areas, so it is hard to compare their situation to mine. I am pretty sure that I would manage to see myself through a PhD degree and I have enough money to pay for it too. I doubt that I would want to stay at a university afterwards though.

**Questions I ask myself**

* Will I benefit from a PhD if I want to get into IT consulting? (salary/career wise, prestige)
* Will I be too old to get a nice job there? (30 years!)
* IT is not really heavily dependent on a formal degree like medicine/biology. Will I see more benefits from a PhD career-wise or would it be better to get 3 years of working experience in that time?
* Any point in a MBA instead of a PhD?
* I am mainly focusing on getting a job in IT consulting, but IT architect wouldn't be completely out of the picture. Do you know any other fields I should take a peak at?
* I have pretty much no work experience, how big a problem is this?
* How important is mobility for work at my age? Do I need to prepare my gf that I might need to relocate?
* I have heard that there are special trainee programs for good university graduates. Are those only aimed at Bsc, or should I still take a look at those with a MA/PhD?
* Is working and a PhD at the same time possible (50/50)? I have heard that this was common practice a decade ago, but no idea if it still is today.


Sorry if the questions are in no particular order, or slightly repeating. These are just things that I keep thinking about. Any advice is highly appreciated, even if it does not touch any of my questions. "
zutes,8,2012-09-13,Driving 'straight through' from Canada to Central America,causeicantoo,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zutes/driving_straight_through_from_canada_to_central/,"I'm looking at doing an internship in Central America, possibly in Puerto Cortes, Honduras.

For planning purposes, however, I'm wondering how many days/hours it will take to drive from Canada (Vancouver) to Central America.  Everything I'm seeing online seems to be either bus trips, or overlanding with open timelines. 
Has anyone ever made this trip, or do you know of websites that will address my questions?

zusfb,2,2012-09-13,"Girlfriend (19) left for Australia, and dumped me (22) two weeks later. Need advice. ",Saius418,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zusfb/girlfriend_19_left_for_australia_and_dumped_me_22/,"My girlfriend (19, now 20) and I (22) had been in a relationship for over 8 months. It was somewhat unexpected; we both just fell in love with each other. We had met at college last August, the both of us being on the crew team. I was on my way out - I graduated this May. She was just starting, although she was already ahead - she had tested out of her first year (academically) of college. 

A few months into our relationship, she was accepted into our college's study abroad program at the University of Newcastle in Australia. I was very excited for her - I had been on a study abroad program at the same age and time she was going on hers. I had gone to Germany for mine, and it seemed so amazing that she was taking the extra leap and going even further!

We knew that this trip would mean that we would be far apart from each other. However, we weren't too worried about that. We had already spent some time in a long distance relationship. Although we met and went to college in Kentucky, I am from New Jersey, and she is from Washington (the state). We had spent our breaks/holidays apart, which went very smoothly, and without issue. We missed each other a lot, but it didn't stop the love we had for each other. 

I graduated in May, and then moved up to Washington DC for my internship. Our relationship continued, even through that. Before she left in July, she came to DC and visited. We spent about a week together, and then two days later, she boarded the plane to Australia. 

We didn't talk for a few days. Her computer wouldn't connect to the Internet, so I didn't hear from her until she got her phone. She was fine, and it turned out she was the only one from our college there. She was starting to meet other Americans, and of course, Australians. 

But then the partying started. At first, this didn’t bother me. We partied at college, we both drank, and we were both pretty social people. But then she started telling me about what she was doing. She took part in a wet t-shirt contest, which she won, but in the process was humiliated by four drunken men who pour their drinks on her. She took part in a jelly-wrestling contest. The University had “zero week” which is a weeks worth of university sanctioned partying and drinking (unheard of in the US) which involved drinking every night, and on one night, a lockdown in her dorm which involved naked drinking games. 

I asked her the basic question: why? She summed it up like this – if you aren’t drinking, no one will talk to you. I told her that I thought that idea was ridiculous, telling her that she is an individual and should have to bow down to peer pressure. I should add that we did not raise our voices or argue. 

The following day, she called and said we needed to break up. She said that she didn’t “want to hurt me.” I was absolutely devastated. We talked about it the following two days after. Through those conversations, we established we would still be friends and still talk to each other. This was also confirmed via Facebook message. 

We’ve been broken up since July 20th. The first week was incredibly rough. I missed a day of work, didn’t sleep and barely ate. It’s gotten a little better over time. The advice my friends and family gave me has helped. But, I still love her. I still want to be with her. Even through all of this, I still would never have a second thought about her. 

We’ve talked occasionally since the break up, but we haven’t talked in a few weeks. Word has reached me through her sister that she is now considering dual citizenship in Australia after two months. This hurts even more. 
I’m at my breaking point with all of this. I don’t know what to do. 

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend went to Australia, got caught up in the party scene, and dumped me because of it. This leads me to the following questions:
1: Is the University of Newcastle like this all the time? Does anybody know anything about this place? Should I have expected this at this university from the beginning? 
2: Should I remain committed to this? It seems like all that happened is that she got caught in the wrong crowd.
I’m more than willing to answer any questions if this doesn’t paint a clear enough picture.

Edit 1: Formatting and Grammar

**Update:** We finally talked again. It took about a month, but she finally picked up the phone and explained why she would not call. She is no longer interested in me. She felt that my actions during the break up and prior to it (during the relationship) resulted in her losing interest. Apparently this loss of interest started in late April. 

So, on my end, I'm living with two opposite mindsets at the moment. One side of me still strongly desires to be with her and repair the relationship. She meant the world to me, and losing he is one of the worst feelings in the world. But, the other side of me is very excited about the future. I've realized that someone who would wait until she was on the other side of the world to dump me, instead of in person, is *not* someone I want to be with. I've realized that I made mistakes during the relationship, but I'm glad that I know those mistakes now, and that I can work to correct them.

Thank you all so much for your help, and a really big thank you to all the Redditors either from or have been to Australia. I'm not typically one to hate on people because of their nationality, but if it wasn't for you all, my anger over the situation would certainly have brought me to that point. Thank you so much for bringing me back down to Earth and helping me realize that it's not the people around her, *it's her*. "

Anyway I'll let you all know if it actually works. Also make sure you finish the personal profile. On the home page of CareerBuzz click (on the left) 

&gt;JUMP TO
&gt;GATech - Division of Professional Practice

And then on the bottom right make sure there's a green checkmark by all the categories of your profile.

Edit 2: Everything works fine now. I'm not sure if it's because I did what they said, or because it just randomly started working. Thanks everybody!"

[What percentage of your customers, would you say, expect a ""happy ending"" or any other type of sexual service?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67gv1z?context=5)|At my first job, probably like 70%. really vulgar things too. I work in a better establishment now, so it doesn't happen often, if ever.
[Did any of your co-workers offer happy endings or etc that weren't officially sanctioned by your employer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67v9g7?context=5)|None of the people i knew did. but the place did have people that did that about 5 years back. I think that's why i dealt with so many pervs. Most of them had been there back when it was raunchy 
[Wow, where was this?  Big city?  Resort?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67m3fz?context=5)|5 star resort in Park City UT.
[Do they usually explicitly ask for it, or just somehow subtly hint at it with language or body language? How would someone go about doing it if it were allowed? I mean, some masseuses probably do it, so what are the cues from either side that it's goin down/up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67h3gy?context=5)|Every person is different. Some people will subtly rub my thigh or use body language. Others are very blatant and will lay on the table on top of all of the sheets **hanging brain** just waiting for me to come *service them*. Or will come out and ask.
[Are the mormons really big into happy endings or is it the tourists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c69duy1?context=5)|There are quite a few people here that aren't mormon. so it's them. 
[I believe that I know where you are talking about, my mom's boyfriend works in PC at a 5 star 5 diamond place. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67v5ob?context=5)|I think there might be more than one, but i'm not sure. I work in a resort and also in a private ski chalets in Deer Valley.
[""I have some tightness in my thigh, do you think you could try to work it out? No, a little higher...a little higher...just a little bit more...""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67l6a3?context=5)|THAT. IS. EXACTLY. IT. spot on. good work.
[What's the worst thing that can happen to someone for making a move like that?  Would you still give them a massage?  Ignore it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67ixmg?context=5)|I tell them to knock it off or I'm going to end the session early. They usually stop then.
[What's the most disturbing thing you've seen on the job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67gxpo?context=5)|I've seen sooo many dicks. People will ""accidently"" flash me. One guy started jerking it during the session. I've had people ""finnish the job"" when i left the room. THAT was a great surprise to walk in on 
[Quite the sticky situation I'd imagine ... thanks for answering.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67gzd4?context=5)|Pun intended? 
[What happens to the guys who get caught jerking it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67gzm5?context=5)|I tell to stop and tell him if he does it again I'll have to kick him out and charge him full price. That usually stops the problem.
[Do you even need to ask? haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67h15h?context=5)|Sorry. it was a little hard.
[What kind of training/certifications do you need to do what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67gwmy?context=5)|I had to go through a full-time program for 10 months + 25 weeks unpaid internship.
[Have you worked with any celebs? If so, who, and were they polite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67gwmy?context=5)|I had to sign a contract saying I would not discuss anyone I have worked on.. but yes. And they were most defiantly NOT polite!
[Can you describe an encounter that was awkward, creepy, and/or hilarious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67gwmy?context=5)|The situation is SOOO creepy. Theres some unattractive naked guy on my table telling me how ""Puuurty"" my mouth is.. (shudders) 
[Note to self, try not to be unattractive. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67h0en?context=5)|Trust me, there's a REASON those men had to pay someone by-the-hour to touch them.
[Are you saying only unattractive people get massages?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67ktnu?context=5)|I'm saying only unattractive people try and pay me for sex during their massage.
[Does your job effect your personal life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67h2bu?context=5)|Sometimes. Sometimes i tell a guy what i do and they assume I do unethical stuff. That gets old really fast. 
[So the attractive ones get benefits? Serious question though. No creepiness implied...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67s1qo?context=5)|Nope. I like to keep it all seperate and not focus on how attractive they are.
[Would you ever consider working with a professional sports team?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67h4ok?context=5)|I definitely would! I LOVE that type of work. but most pro athletes are have calves bigger than my waist. Which would make it very hard on my body and probably not as equipped as someone else.
[The denser the muscle, the more muscle you need to massage it, right?  Have you ever had a client that was so fat/burly/whatever that you couldn't effectively work on them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67p3gi?context=5)|Yeah i have a hard time with the ""large community"". it's definitely a problem i have to get over.
[Well have you ever considered a pro soccer team?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67h89a?context=5)|I have. but i really like the spa atmosphere right now. but i plan on expanding eventually. Maybe i'll give that a try.
[, thank you for doing this AMA. I have always wondered what the other side of the story is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67htws?context=5)|Thanks for all of the questions! This was my first time posting anything, so i was really worried it would end horribly.
[Now, the question: What happens if you are giving a massage to a guy you find attractive/has a good body? Does it also turn you on physically or is it just 'normal'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67htws?context=5)|And people who are attractive do come in, and it can be difficult. I do my best to not think about it though. On occasion they start to flirt with me and all i can think is *stop it you fool! I'm trying REALLY HARD to ignore you right now!*. But i've never gotten like insanely turned on from anyone, just moderately. 
[Any proof? is there any back massage techniques you'd recommend? office work...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67hi25?context=5)|Fun trick. if you go to someone that is completely relaxed and squeeze the very top of their traps (almost into their neck, but still on their shoulders) they will get very sharp pains in their head and could pass out. Have fun kids. 
[Ah the old vulcan death grip.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67ihzy?context=5)|Does this make me an accomplis? 
[As some one who has incredibly painful, dense and large trigger points in my traps.. I would probably hit you if you did this while i was relaxed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67nx3l?context=5)|Or die 
[Yeah, that too.  I used to date a Massage Therapist who was also an RN. When I got my first massage from here i thought it was going to be something sexual in nature.  I was totally surprised how good it felt (more so after a couple of sessions\) than how sensual or erotic as i was expecting it to feel.  Do you think most people who come to you for a massage have that expectation of it being sensual instead of medical?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67oxoo?context=5)|Yeah quite a few people do. or people with no experience with massage assume it's sensual when i tell them that's what i do.
[Unintentional erections: does it happen often, is it obvious, are you embarrassed, does the guy apologize?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67kppz?context=5)|A slight erection happens with most males. It's not very obvious and no im not embarrassed. It's not their fault. and they usually ignore it like i do.
[Ever had a client let out a stinky fart?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67n7jc?context=5)|ALL THE TIME!! old people have the worst farts.
[Whats the biggest dick you've seen? in inches? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67p5y2?context=5)|No idea in inches, but he was a massive african american. went to mid thigh.. id guess 9 - 10.
[Flacid or erect? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67rhes?context=5)|Quarter chub.
[Do you ever get embarrassed when someone starts moaning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67hlqg?context=5)|I do the ""silent laugh"" whenever someone does. I can't help it. 
[What's a silent laugh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67og85?context=5)|When you laugh but you try really hard to not make noise.? 
[Is nobody else appreciating OPs username?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67icmb?context=5)|Its because i believe in aliens.
[On Keyboard, The Big D... Rusty Shackelford.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67xyge?context=5)|=D.
[By now your name and particulars have been fed into every laptop, desktop, mainframe and supermarket scanner that collectively make up the global information conspiracy, otherwise known as ""The Beast.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67j48j?context=5)|Good thing none of this is real.. or is it.. *shu shaaa*
[Do hairy backs make you barf a little in your mouth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67hvfo?context=5)|No not anymore. they used to sicken me. My first massage EVER in my internship, i got this old overweight woman who had moles all over her back that were bigger than quarters. They where various shades of dark grey and brown, smelled like death, and had a sand-like residue that came off with every stroke. That was the first time i questioned my profession. But i kept going because I already paid for the program. But in hindsight, I'm SOO glad i had her as my first. I feel like once i saw that, i could take anything. 
[Do you have to tell them they should see a doctor if you see something like that in case it's skin cancer? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67iycq?context=5)|I'm not allowed to diagnose because it's not in my ""scope of practice"" and i can get sued. but if i see something that looks strange i can suggest they see a professional.
[Is it weird for a masseuse to massage the butt or inner thigh area? To me, it would just be too difficult to stay completely professional while massaging areas so personal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67h8pk?context=5)|At first, it was a little weird. and it's only still weird if they have already made a pass at me. But for regular clients, no problem. I see it as strictly professional. and most of the time i am imagining all of the muscles under the skin anyway, so i I'm not even focused on your *butt* but more your *glute* if that makes sense.
[ now for the obligatory: Do you ever meet back up with clients in your personal life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67h8pk?context=5)|And no make it a rule not to. I have had to reject very tempting dinner offeres before, but it's part of the job.
[Is it actually a work/legal issue if you did accept these offers? It would seem unfair if it was, since in any other job I can think of it's fine to meet people on the job as long as it isn't interfering with it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67hfkw?context=5)|There's no legal issue to date outside of work, i just prefer to not do it. something about having already seen someone naked before the first date seems wrong to me.
[Also, how do your hands take it? My hands are sore as hell after maybe 20 minutes of concentrated massaging. A long time ago, I got an hour long massage (volunteering to be a guinea pig for students\). It was great, but it always made me wonder how the hell so many petite girls can use enough pressure to really work the muscles for a full hour. I'm a fairly active guy and I can't do it. Does it just take a lot of time to build up strength, or is there some technique to not exhausting your hand the the point of soreness?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67hfkw?context=5)|And after a long day my hands hurt, but there's a technique. It's mostly body weight on your forearms actually. so hands are usually safe 
[Thanks for the great answers. I'll see if I can adjust my method to take some of the strain off my hands.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67hovq?context=5)|Just think more leaning, less squeezing. putting your forearms or elbow on someones back and leaning with all your body weight will give you good results for sure. 
[It's definitely true that I spend most of the time squeezing with my hands.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67hraw?context=5)|That is definitely harder on your hands. It's hard to explain things you can doo... use your forearm on her traps. start by her neck and lean while rocking your arm make your hands into fists on her back and use your knuckles to make circles  put your hands on her back and pretend you are typing REALLY HARD. move up from the middle of her back up to her neck. ^^ that will get you so much ass.
[*^ that will get you so much ass.*  Haha it's like you've known me all my life. Thanks again for the tips, they are pretty clearly explained. It'll just be a matter of practice I think.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67hvqx?context=5)|The best of luck to you.
[You also give massages to women as well, right? whats that like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67hjm3?context=5)|All the time. It's not really **like** anything. women are pickier, but at least i don't have to worry about being groped 
[We've heard a fair bit about guys assuming a 'happy ending' is the norm, but have you ever had any women make a similar attempt? Do you think this would be more or less of an issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67maxl?context=5)|I've never had it, but i would treat her just like I would treat any man i suppose.
[Do customers have to inform you about certain injuries / skin conditions? Do they have to sign waivers or something of that sort? I imagine there's always some douche who wants to sue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67iux5?context=5)|All customers sign a health waiver before the session explaining any health concerns, sensitivity or allergies. I also liability insurance just in case.
[What are the general hygiene practices that you follow in the line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67iux5?context=5)|I'm super clean. Washing my hands up to my elbow before and after sessions, changing sheets every time and not touching my face during the massage all keep me pretty healthy.
[Are back massages the majority of your work? Any requests for massages on the glutes, hamstrings or calves?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67iux5?context=5)|The back is what most people like to be the ""main focus"", but i do all of it. especially where i work, there are a lot of skiers and marathon runners.
[As part of your training, what do you learn? Human Anatomy studies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67iux5?context=5)|Yes i took an intense anatomy/kinesiology course through the span of school. as well as anatomy/physiology and pathology.
[Any accidents (not the jizz on the floor type\) or injuries on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67iux5?context=5)|I fell down once. I was leaning really deeply into somones shoulder and they flinched so i moved and fell on them. very embarasssing.
[Is it hard to massage skinny people ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67ii17?context=5)|Way easier.
[Why did you decide to become a masseuse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67l3ra?context=5)|I wanted to learn some kind of trade so i could work through school. and it was either that or beauty school. But i ended up REALLY liking it more than i expected.
[What's your future prospects? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67l3ra?context=5)|I want to be a high school health teacher. 
[When im on my back and you're at the ""massaging my arms"" part, is it weird if i'm looking at you? or should i keep my eyes closed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67mzb8?context=5)|I always put a hot towel on their eyes. Cuz it gets a little awkward if your looking at me.
[I've only started getting massages for about the last two years. I wanted to before that but I had mild-moderate acne on my shoulders and felt very self-conscious and uncomfortable so I took care of that problem first. In retrospect, I know it would have been uncomfortable for me but is that something that bothers people in your profession? Or is it just something that comes along with the job?  I don't have a set masseuse. I get massages from whoever is available at the time when I am available. I have come across attractive masseuses and we've chatted during the hour and had pretty good conversation I thought. There has been a time or two where I've been tempted to ask her to lunch or coffee but didn't to avoid breaching professional contact. Have you had return customers whom you've turned down, and did it affect your masseuse/client relationship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67lfnz?context=5)|No don't worry about the acne. Trust me, anyone you go to has probably seen alot worse than your shoulders.  Yes i have turned people down. It's tough! Not every day do you get an attractive male who you can have a pleasent conversation with despite the fact that your rubbing him naked. But i just like to keep work and personal life seperate.
[Do you make enough to get by? are you happy with your wage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67jnhp?context=5)|Very happy with my wage. I can walk away from a day with $500 or more in my hand. I do my own taxes and can write off almost everything.  
[Teach me your ways. All of them. From massages to taxes. We could take over the world Pinky! Really though it's awesome you can do your own taxes... I'm stupid I guess.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67noay?context=5)|Oh my mistake. when i said that i meant that i'm self employed and taxes are my responsibility. i pay someone to take care of it all.
[Ah. Less take over for you. But still some for putting up with the repeat question of ""do you touch penis for a living?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67nzx7?context=5)|Once i tell people what i do, that's usually the first following question.
[Taboo, but fuck it. What's your income?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67iibk?context=5)|It's based off commission of the spa i work in. but total including tip i make $52/1hr massages.
[You're making $52 an hour?  $104,000 a year if you worked the standard 2000-hour work year?  Pretty good for a 19-year-old.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67u955?context=5)|Cash monaaay.
[ how many clients a day? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67jou5?context=5)|Depends on the season. in the summer i averaged 4 a day 4 days a week.  In the winter ill get 6 a day 4 days a week guaranteed.  
[What cut does the spa get?  Do clients offer to see you outside the spa to cut them out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67kp27?context=5)|Most clients are visiting from far away and are staying in the resort. so they really have no need to see me later on.
[Thanks for answering. Do you do special hand and arm stretches before/in between clients?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67im17?context=5)|Yeah just basic ones.
[Wow, a lot of people *would* give happy endings for that kind of cheddar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67ug0n?context=5)|Exactly. you can make good money in the industry without exploiting yourself, so why would i?
[So you only work 4 hours a day and 4 days a week on average? What do you do when there are no clients?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67vw0t?context=5)|Yeah that's average. I'm on call 4 days a week and i average 16 massages a week. If no one comes in, i don't get paid. That's the biggest downfall.
[Ever ha sex with a customer?  After a good massage should I feel a bit sore in my muscles afterward?  Are you prepared for a zombie apocalypse really? If so whats your go to strategy?  How old were you when you lost your virginiyt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67kri7?context=5)|No i haven't. haven't you read anything that's on here??  If the zombie apocalypse is real, i'm going to shoot my brains out at the first sign of a walker.. sooo id say im prepared. And i was 16.
[You sound like an attractive, motivated, and fun young woman. You give massagaes for a living and like the walking dead. How come someone hasn't married you yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67qtv2?context=5)|I'm too awesome.
[When you were learning in school, did you or any of your classmates ever ""screw up"" and injure somebody? Is that even possible? I would love to go volunteer to be a guinnea pig at a massage school, but free massages (even from students\) seems too good to be true. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67jotx?context=5)|In school there was a TA (alumni of the program) who the instructor demonstrated things on. Then we would practice on eachother. Everyone was soo scared of hurting eachother that we were afraid to do anything too intense yanno?
[I worked at a massage place for awhile and they were hardcore about not being called ""masseuse"". They said it inferred the sexual type of massage and preferred to be called ""massage therapist"". What do you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67kd2n?context=5)|Totally agree. I just figured for the AMA i'd put masseuse. I usually use licensed massage therapist or licensed bodyworker.
[I have ""Climber's Elbow"" virtually physiologically identical to ""Tennis Elbow"".  If I go see a masseuse, what kind of massage should I ask for to help prommote healing to that area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67misn?context=5)|If they know any ""lymph drainage"" techniques, that would be best.

Also, if you have someone to help you this is REALLY helpful.
 |Lay on your back.
 |Put your knees up and lift your feet off the ground.
 |Have a friend put pressure on your knees. like they are trying to push your leg into the ground. youll feel that in your low back/sacrum.

[Thanks for doing the AMA. Just a question about the differences between say Thai massage, Swedish massage and something like deep tissue. How are they different? Which type of massage would you recommend for sportsmen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zt3dt/iama_young_female_masseuse_ama/c67u1za?context=5)|I don't have any experience with Thai massage. But swedish massage is slower and more ""relaxing"". Deep tissue deals with connective tissues under the skin as well as trigger points (knots). I'd suggest getting a sport massage. It's kind of like a fast-passed swedish. nothing too deep. lots of stretching and stimulating of the muscles.

My school has this big campus event with lots of big companies having on-campus interviews, and on my school's job portal website they have two positions with Ernst and Young for tax and audit. I know people here say have a clear choice of what you want because the firms hate wishy-washy, so should I apply for both on-campus interview positions?

Another question -- should I make business cards up to give to the people who interview me? I'm in the process now of making them on the advice of a previous poster, but I'd like to get a more consensus opinion. If I don't get a lot of responses I'll just spam a separate thread with the question.

zxt36,5,2012-09-15,Am I[30m] being too needy with my girlfriend[24F]? Please tell me I am....,Iluvpeanutbutter,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zxt36/am_i30m_being_too_needy_with_my_girlfriend24f/,"This is a throwaway and a word of caution, this is going to be a really long read. To anyone who actually goes out of their way to read this and respond, thank you. I feel like I’m going crazy, and I need someone to tell me that I’m either a) over reacting /being a pansy and need to man the fuck up and am too damn needy or b) have every right to be worried. 

My girlfriend was a foreign exchange student studying English that I met here (we’re both the same nationality and I’m fluent in both languages so there isn’t any miscommunication in language). She had a boyfriend when she first moved here but she broke it off with him a few months in. She told me she felt nothing when breaking it off with him, but he obviously still had feelings for her. We’ve been together for 8 months, we got together about 2 months after she broke up with her ex.  Right off the bat I know some of you might say “oh, you were a rebound.” But the things she left with me, the gifts she personally made me, and the things she said to me make me feel that she did everything with sincerity. There’s also a possibility that she used me to be shown around the city, taken to places etc, but if she did, she deserves an award for best actress.  Another important note - she tells me that her mother cannot know that she had/is in a relationship with someone in the States if she ever wants to come back here. There are no picture of us together or even a single picture of me on her Facebook. She asked if I wanted the pictures uploaded, I said no. I still feel like I'm being hidden for reasons unknown....

She returned back home to her country 6 weeks ago. I thought she was going to go home and never return so I just wanted to treat it as a fling, but before she left she kept telling me she was going to come back and find a job here as after graduating school(this December) and asked me to wait for her. So the relationship continues…. 

We are on an 18 hour time difference so it makes things somewhat difficult. For the first 4 weeks after she returned, she didn’t have school so we talked/texted a lot, from when I finished work until I went to sleep(around 5-6 hours a day).  She would text me when she would be on the subway/bus, while she was walking on the street, call me when she would get home from going out with her friends etc etc. 3 weeks ago her grandfather got deathly ill, as in the doctors tell her and her family everyday, “he might pass today” ill.  She is, to this day, by his side every moment she’s not studying or in school (from what she says).

One week into her grandfather’s illness, the texting didn’t exactly stop, she was able to text me/call me even though she was by his side, but sometimes the messages would pause because people would come visit or she had to be with her family etc, and she then started to respond to messages the following day. Then school started two weeks ago and the contact dropped off a cliff. Within the past two weeks there were days when we’ve exchanged a message just once. This past week there was a time when she couldn’t respond, it turns out her mom was so stressed out about the grandfathers illness that even she had to be omitted to the hospital. She apologizes profusely, saying she’s extremely busy taking care of her grandfather, going to school, studying for tests (work related, and school related), and busy writing her resume and applying for internships so she can gather experience and come back here. She’s busy, I understand that. But a handful of times and yesterday she had time to comment on Facebook pictures and post a status update saying she was sick of studying. She didn’t do this before; she would contact me first before anything else. 

Her and her ex have the same best friends, they’re in the same social circle. Sidenote *She never told me his name but when she was still in a relationship she put up a facebook link regarding her boyfriend with her boyfriend tagged in it. So I know his name. * She was worried about going back home because she told me before school started that it would be quite awkward around her ex, that she didn’t really want to talk/see him. Also her ex is in one of her classes and the same film club (she told me this before hand). On the first day of school she told me that around 100 of their friends/classmates got together and made the two of them promise to “get along.” I have no problem with her spending time with her ex (as long as other friends are there) and it’s pretty much inevitable since they share the same friends. 
Here’s why I’m a little worried. A week before school  began she told me she went drinking with her “Bestest Friends,”  and her ex was tagged at the location on Facebook. I find it weird that SHE TAGGED HIM after telling me countless time how awkward seeing him would be. Maybe her other friends brought him along and she felt bad tagging them and not him. I don’t know. 

She obviously doesn’t know I know his name, so we talked on the phone the day after and she told me she went drinking with her best friends. She never mentioned her ex being there. I tried to give her a chance to let me know he was by saying, “you’re going to see your ex at school soon, aren’t you nervous about seeing him?” she said that HER FRIENDS said that, “he’s okay now,” and that “there would be no more problems.” I just threw out there, “so this is the first time you’ve seen your ex since you got back right?” She replied “yeah.” I understand some girls keep things like this from guys, with the reason usually being, “I thought you would be angry,” but it irks me a little. Side note *My best friend broke up with his girlfriend of a year because she didn’t tell him a male friend that liked her was hanging out with her and I told this story to my girlfriend when she went back to her country. A very similar situation to mine at the moment so I understand that my girlfriend might have been a little scared to tell me after that story.*

Anyway, there were a few more times when she and her ex were tagged(not her update) in the same location but she swears she was at the hospital, that her friends tagged her in spirit because she’s always stuck there and feel sorry for her that she can’t go out. It does seem somewhat true as there are never pictures of her at the location but pictures of others. A few days ago, she uploaded a picture with 3 busted cell phones (her iphone looks like a truck ran over it, it’s been like this for months) and one of cell phones was her ex’s (he was tagged on it, SHE tagged HIM). She still tells me she doesn’t hang out with her ex and again, she’s too busy to contact me. 

The messaging system we use lets us know if the other has read a message, before she wouldn’t read them if she wasn’t able to respond but would respond after reading them. For about the past week or so, she’s been reading them but not responding until the next day saying again, “I was sooo busy.”  I asked her to call me two days ago when she had time, she said “okay!!!” but has yet to do so. 

I guess here’s my question, am I being too needy? She’s extremely busy, I can see that, but if she has an hour time on public transport everyday going to school, if she has time to check facebook and look at pictures and comment on them, if she has time to take pictures and tag her ex, if she has 4 hour breaks in between classes some days, am I being too needy in wanting a “hello?” during those times instead of an “I’m so sorry I was busy” the next day or a couple of days later? And then wait another day for the same ""I'm so sorry I was busy,"" response? I've never had a time where there has been this little communication with a girlfriend, then again, I’ve never been in a long distance relationship with such distance.  

What should I do? I see two ways in going on about this, 1) ask her what has changed, i.e. you still ride the subway/bus to school for an hour, stay next to your grandfather with your phone in hand, have hour long breaks in between classes, have time to upload photos  and update status on Facebook, why no contact? 2) Just laugh it off, she’s stressed enough as it is, and respond with “don’t worry, I know you’re busy.” 

Thanks folks, I need to get this off my chest.  My friends tell me to just “talk to her,” but it’s difficult to communicate with someone that I literally can’t get in contact with.  

TL;DR - girlfriend is saying she is too busy to contact me with school,work,taking care of a deathly ill grandfather after returning home to her country but has time to be on Facebook and tag her ex boyfriend who she still tells me she doesn't hang out with because she doesn't know I know his name. Facebook ruins relationships.

Edit - TL;DR

She has decided to quite uni, which I think is a good thing, as she was struggling concentrating on it and she was having major anxiety attacks with it. She has come back home and just finished her intern ship with a company in London. Whilst all this was going on, she was slipping further and further into her own little world. She wants to get a job, she wants to move on with her life, but she really is lacking any motivation and determination to do so. She keeps journal, writes down her mood, what her worries are and what is plaguing on her mind. I've read it (she wants me to, and I want to, to get a better understanding of it.) a lot of what she writes, is about guilt, relying on everyone else and how I am the only reason to keep going on (if you know what I mean.)
She is on anti-depressants (don't know what kind), and has booked to see a counsellor. She feels happier when she isn't taking the anti-depressants and sleeps better too (is this normal?)

I'm just wondering with you fellow sufferers and SO's of sufferers, how do you keep it under wraps? How can I contribute help her cope with it? I want to help her, but I really don't know how. I want to make it easier for her. Also is it selfish of me to complain about it, when she's the one who has it?

After working my first internship this summer, I have found that I am much more interested in design that I thought I was, and my biomedical engineering degree essentially sets me up for a quality assurance role (rather than an engineering role) in large companies. With this in mind, I have now thought that I should get a masters in mechanical so that I don't pigeonhole myself to the medical device field, but also so that I am seen as more of an engineer rather than a QA person. My question is, are there masters programs that focus specifically on design, or would you have to pick a more specific concentration than that. Also, has anyone ever heard of a biomedical undergrad doing a mechanical masters? I have heard of it the other way around. 

ALSO, please note that I am too far into my education to switch my undergrad to mechanical, so please don't suggest this."

For the past 3 years my mother has grown more and more abusive towards me. All my siblings have moved out of the house and my father is always working; Leaving just me and my mother home most of the day. She is 59, i'm 19. I'm a full time pre-med student who commutes to school, i also have a job along with an internship. My mother spends her free time bullying me to no end. Her goal from morning till night is to convince me I'm: Dumb, wimpy, lazy, a ""sissy"", pathetic, ""i sleep too much"", and i'm a failure. Shes a small old lady with bad arthritis, yet she constantly slaps me in my face, kicks me in my shins, hits me various objects, throws various objects, and pounds on the door to my room.

Basically my mom is a malicious bully who 24/7 is in attack mode. I've pleaded with her to stop treating me this way. She rationalizes her extreme behavior by saying ""This is the way you deserve to be treated"", because of my mothers age she constantly needs my assistance to do basic tasks (work the tv, use the computer, carry groceries out of her car) She takes advantage of this by demeaning me the entire time i'm helping her, and because of guilt, i have to carry on helping her and take it.


My mom has bad arthritis and knows i would never hurt her physically, she takes advantage of this by constantly getting in my face, (then she'll slap me or kick me)


Backstory: My mother has been sick her entire life, but has always been very lucky, and always had an amazing attitude about it. She first got breast cancer, but she received a double mastectomy immediately and was fine. 5 years later she gets ovarian cancer, has her ovaries removed and was completely fine and completely happy. 4 years later her kidneys begin to fail (caused by doctors malpractice) She began dialysis (still happy and loving as ever). But then she received a kidney transplant and everything changed.


Upon coming home from her kidney transplant my mother had developed this evil rotten attitude. Since the surgery her personality has changed. She is on a ton of meds and I'm afraid these have changed her brain chemistry. (just assuming but whatever).
My mother has had an amazing life, wealthy upbringing, loving successful children, loving grandkids (she has 6 little ones). She spends most of her days shopping. and doing whatever she wants. my father is very loving towards her. (he has always worked ridiculous hours, so this hasnt negatively affected their long 40 yr relationship)
Additional info: I've noticed my mother only bullies me and my grandmother (her mother). the first 2 years she desperately tried to hide her crazy tendencies from the rest of the family, and would only lashout in private. Now she can't really control herself and the cats out of the bag. No one really cares to fix her probelm because no one has to deal with it except me, and occasionally my grandmother. everyone just kinda shrugs it off, blaming her age. everyone just tells me to be strong and not to let her bother me.


Also, this has been happening for 3 years, but it has gotten worse this past year, only because we have moved into a new home, our old home had many stairs and it was easy for me to keep my distance from her. Also sound didnt travel far in our old house. In our new home, there are less stairs and sound carries much easier throughout the house.


SHe takes advantage of this by coming and pounding on my door when ever she feels. ""Just to see what i'm up too"", she'll also talk badly about me, to herself, knowing i'll be able to hear her.
She also comforts herself using projection. she's beginning to lose her hearing, so her new thing is that she's trying to convince me i'm deaf.
when she first came home from her kidney transplant, her short term memory and vocabulary became absolutely terrible. I didnt mind because i know she's been through alot, but she began doing everything in her power to convince me i'm an idiot.


I'm desperate for help, hope all this is coherent. Thanks in advance!
If i stick up for myself i feel terrible because i hate yelling all day, if i take her bull shit, i feel terrible for not sticking up to myself. This is ruining my self confidence and just fucking with my head...

**Edit: Should i go through her meds, figure out what she's taking, then mention to her that she should speak to her doctor about this drug?** The odds of her following through with this is slim, but if i hammer the idea that a drug is causing this she might follow through, she's extemely irresponsible, and blaming a drug (even though it may actually be a culprit) might be something she'll follow through with."

Our original plan was that I would graduate school and look for a job where he is. However, I just landed an internship at the best company ever, in the exact field I want to pursue, in the city I've always wanted to live in. Seriously, I can't even believe my luck. My boss told me that they want the internship to lead to a full-time position if I do well, so I'm working my ass off.

But that leaves Boyfriend and I in a quandary. He's got a good job in his area. And as much as he loves my area, he's afraid he won't be able to get a job here since he doesn't have much experience. He thinks he'd need to stick it out there for 3-4 more years before any new company would want to hire him. I'm not in love with his area, but I was willing to move there for the job opportunities and of course, for Boyfriend. Now that I have my dream job in my dream city, I really don't want to give it up to start all over in a place neither one of us loves.

We'll definitely talk things over throughout the year and there is a ton that can change between now and then, but in the back of my mind I'm scared that we'll find ourselves in a deadlock a year from now. It just makes me nervous to not have a plan for when and how we'll close the distance. Neither one of us thinks we'll be able to find a job that's as good as our current one. And I know neither one of us wants the other to have to give up their dream job.

So I'm curious to hear how the rest of r/longdistance decided how to close the gap. What is your plan, and how did you decide who was going to move? And if anyone has any advice for things Boyfriend and I should consider/discuss, I'd love to hear it."

I threw it together in about 45 minutes and am just looking for some very basic, preliminary feedback to begin refining the cover letter. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. I left out all the addresses and did some obvious censoring. If that hinders any context, I apologize.

Dear Ms. XXX, 

It comes as no surprise, the birth of my daughter two and a half years ago sculpted my outlook on life and gave me new found appreciation that I had not had prior. The experience provided scope and scale to people helping their fellow man, be it in any shape or fashion. It was also the catalyst for new found motivations to help others less fortunate, change the political climate of America and to perform as best I can in anything I do. The three of these have led me to the pursuit of an internship within a political setting, not just for academic credit but, because I feel the experience will assist and compliment all my efforts in those three settings.

With these being my motivations, I feel I would make a great asset to Senator XXX’s administrative team and the United States Senate as whole. In my three years of collegiate classes at XXX University in the field of mass communications, and various classes at XXX XXX College, a junior college in Illinois, I feel I have obtained excellent writing skills. Also in my studies of political science at XXX University and XXX College, I have gained a vast knowledge of the political process. An internship with Senator XXX and his/her staff would only help this knowledge grow and enable me further in the future. In addition to classes relating to the political and communication process, I have previous internship experience in a public relations setting. Also, I have written for my high school, junior college and university’s campus newspapers. Participating in the New York Times sponsored “Times Talks” luncheons have advanced my understanding of international and current affairs. Those luncheons have cultivated a need to stay informed that should be instilled within everyone. An internship with Senator XXX would help satisfy this need. 

My previous employers have also helped build my ideologues on helping others. My first job started it; a simple job of refueling airplanes at my local airport. I recall when a pilot crashed into the on-site fuel pumps. Fearing a fire, I ran to the wreckage with a fire extinguisher in hand. No fire resulted but the pilot’s safety, and his gratitude for my concern of his safety, had a reciprocal effect on me. I felt good about caring for others. This carried on through various jobs resulting in customer service. The most recent of which, working for a local rental car company, allows me to have a direct impact on patrons’ satisfaction and safety. Although fairly basic, this element is rewarding. The next, big step is to the world of politics where I could help the masses. Not just a few.

For all of this, I would be honored to be presented the opportunity to work with a monumental leader like Senator XXX. I will be happy to call directly to discuss any opportunity given as the term I am applying for approaches. If you or any of your staff wish to contact me, I can be reached at ###-#00-9##4 or emailed at turtlewaxer99@myschool.edu. I look forward to speaking with you and your staff.

See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Dream No Evil

	Years and years ago, travelers from distant corners of the world discovered the land and founded our country, America, that we know today as the beautiful land of the free and home of the brave. Throughout the founder’s progress, the idea of the American Dream slowly grew as our great nation also did. But what does the American Dream truly mean? *Hundreds of notions are interpreted when the thought of the American Dream is approached, and this concept includes, but is not limited to, prosperity, knowledge, freedom, equality, and happiness.*

	The American Dream attains a process similar to that of Social Darwinism and the Theory of Evolution, evolving over time as all society and life on Earth does. As our country grows and develops, the ideas and desires that are included in the American Dream change. Over time, these have transposed, for example, from the rights of blacks and women, to the rights of gays and lesbians. Our nation is now nearly entirely acceptant of all religions, surely a part of some peoples’ dream, but is it even close to acceptance of atheism, deism, or even nihilism? Appearing acceptant, our society actually does not even attempt to accept all people. Another aspect of the American Dream is success and prosperity, but certainly not all of us are able to achieve these things. Lastly, we all long and dream for wealth and the joy that it may bring, but once again, we are not always able to fulfill our pursuit of these items. On a personal level, there is no grandeur list of superficial items and physical things that I long for. In my lifetime, I truly and simply hope to amount up to a successful person. I crave knowledge and education, **and as an atheist myself, an end to the persecution of atheism.** I hope for a nation where all people live together in harmony, no matter who you are, what you believe, or where you have been. I dream of a great career and I desire to study in a field that I have true passion for. I long to be a wealthy person, able to provide for my family. I wish to be a good father and a good husband. These are the parts to my American Dream.

	The various entities to a dream like this cannot all be accomplished and fulfilled by the means of just one individual, but many of them can be. A placid, mellow, accepting society cannot be completely implemented by a single person, but one can achieve great steps toward it nonetheless. To achieve an intimate level of success and wealth, I candidly need to work my hardest at all times, in every situation, ranging from high school to college, and internships to a true career. To create and support a happy family, I need to remain persevering in my longing for knowledge and a career, and also be able to maintain the ability to stay calm and collected when under the pressure of stress and frustration. Simply hoping will not make things spontaneously happen; you must put yourself into action. This is the recipe to my dream.

	In conclusion, the American Dream is made up of billions of different ideas, from millions of different individuals. These ideas evolve and change with the growth of our nation and our culture, meaning we can never confirm the true dream, but we can certainly agree on varying aspects of this American Dream. *Hundreds of notions are interpreted when the thought of the American Dream is approached, and this concept includes, but is not limited to, prosperity, knowledge, freedom, equality, and happiness.*"

* Otherwise, do you think there may be any reasonably well-paying jobs that would suit a university graduate? I'll need to be making some money, and would rather not be a waitress or anything.

* I have been wanting to try marijuana for a while. My boyfriend is completely against it, so this may be my only opportunity to do so.

A little of background info: I'm currently a junior at University of Michigan majoring in Civil Engineering (structural). I have 3.76 GPA, and I don't expect it to dip below 3.5 by the time I graduate. I've done a web-development internship my first two summers, and I'm planning to do a civil related internship this summer. 

My options are to either go to get my masters after I graduate or go straight to a civil firm. The masters degree I can get at Michigan in 1 year (albiet a very stressful one). But what I'm afraid of is whether it will be harder to hire me because of my master's degree, because they will have to pay me more when they can get an undergrad with the same amount of practical experience as me for less salary. I've heard time and time again that experience counts the most in engineering. 

So Reddit, any advice? Do you think that the masters degree is worth it? Any one in managerial position willing to weigh in on whether they'd hire an undergrad (less salary) or masters(more salary) with the same amount of experience?

I am currently pondering whether I should start working after finishing my MA-Degree or if I should enroll for another (approximately) 4 years in a PhD program. (Already posted the same question to a [computer science sub-reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zuu5f/work_now_or_get_a_phd/), but I would like to get another perspective on this matter, as my degree is half IT and half econ)

First some information on me, then on my degree and university and then on some of my strengths and weaknesses. 

My questions are in the end, and I hope that people with more experience can help me out with their opinions. I also asked friends, but those also trying to get a PhD are in different areas, so it is hard to compare their situation to mine. I am pretty sure that I would manage to see myself through a PhD degree and I have enough money to pay for it too. I doubt that I would want to stay at a university afterwards though.

Weaknesses:| Bad at remembering names. Not a party guy/slightly reserved towards people 
 Talents:| Persuasive/convincing speaker, really good at giving/designing presentations, appears confident, IT geek at heart, getting stuff done. 
 



**Questions I ask myself**

* Will I benefit from a PhD if I want to get into IT consulting? (salary/career wise, prestige)
* Will I be too old to get a nice job there? (30 years!)
* IT is not really heavily dependent on a formal degree like medicine/biology. Will I see more benefits from a PhD career-wise or would it be better to get 3 years of working experience in that time?
* Any point in a MBA instead of a PhD?
* Would some management trainee program (e.g. Microsoft MACH) benefit me more career wise, than starting to work directly or doing a PhD?
* Many of these trainee programs are also available for BA students. I fear that I would be underutilized if such a program is held at BA level and not on MA level. Am I right to assume this, or are those programs generally organized two-fold?
* I am mainly focusing on getting a job in IT consulting, but IT architect and IT project management wouldn't be completely out of the picture. Do you know any other fields I should take a peak at?
* I have pretty much no work experience, how big a problem is this?
* How important is mobility for work at my age? Do I need to prepare my gf that I might need to relocate?
* Is working and a PhD at the same time possible (50/50)? I have heard that this was common practice a decade ago, but no idea if it still is today. Alas I know no one, that is getting paid my any firm to get a PhD while doing research for them. 
* Does an MBA make sense, given my studies already involved (pretty much all) basic concepts of econ? 
* I have read here, that the consulting market is currently slightly over-satturated, and that it is hard to get a leg in the door. Does this also hold true for the big4?
* I have a bit of contact with all big4, especially with PWC. Forgive my ignorance on this, but how important is something like this in order to get a job with them? Should I pursue these contacts in order to land a job with them?  

Sorry if the questions are in no particular order, or slightly repeating. These are just things that I keep thinking about. Any advice is highly appreciated, even if it does not touch any of my questions. "

I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while now, and thought you guys would maybe be able to help me.

I'm 19, and am studying material chemistry at Joseph Fourier's University in Grenoble, France. This is my second year and an internship of 10 weeks (from the 15th of April to the 21st of June) is requested.

Usually, students here simply look around for an enterprise or a lab around the region but it sometimes happen that a few of them get the chance to go abroad. (Baton Rouge in the United States, Kaunas in Lithuania, etc...) 

Not so many students choose this way because not all of them are interested by studying and working abroad but in my opinion it can be nothing else than a wonderful experience.

Thing is that we must find this internship mostly by ourselves, even if teachers stay here to help and offer partnerships with other universities.

I don't really know what else to say as it's a bit new for me but I know that if I don't try now, I will never do.

I'm waiting for advices, help, and stay open to any of your questions!

Thanks a lot in advance."
zx2pu,2,2012-09-15,Mother is Physically and Verbally Abusive,xx5xx10,familysupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/familysupport/comments/zx2pu/mother_is_physically_and_verbally_abusive/,"Hopefully I explain myself properly, but here goes..

For the past 3 years my mother has grown more and more abusive towards me. All my siblings have moved out of the house and my father is always working; Leaving just me and my mother home most of the day. She is 59, i'm 19. I'm a full time pre-med student who commutes to school, i also have a job along with an internship. My mother spends her free time bullying me to no end. Her goal from morning till night is to convince me I'm: Dumb, wimpy, lazy, a ""sissy"", pathetic, ""i sleep too much"", and i'm a failure. Shes a small old lady with bad arthritis, yet she constantly slaps me in my face, kicks me in my shins, hits me various objects, throws various objects, and pounds on the door to my room. 

Basically my mom is a malicious bully who 24/7 is in attack mode. I've pleaded with her to stop treating me this way. She rationalizes her extreme behavior by saying ""This is the way you deserve to be treated"", because of my mothers age she constantly needs my assistance to do basic tasks (work the tv, use the computer, carry groceries out of her car) She takes advantage of this by demeaning me the entire time i'm helping her, and because of guilt, i have to carry on helping her and take it. 

My mom has bad arthritis and knows i would never hurt her physically, she takes advantage of this by constantly getting in my face, (then she'll slap me or kick me, even try to punch me in my man parts *creepy i know*)

Backstory: My mother has been sick her entire life, but has always been very lucky, and always had an amazing attitude about it. She first got breast cancer, but she received a double mastectomy immediately and was fine. 5 years later she gets ovarian cancer, has her ovaries removed and was completely fine and completely happy. 4 years later her kidneys begin to fail (caused by doctors malpractice) She began dialysis (still happy and loving as ever). But then she received a kidney transplant and everything changed. 

Upon coming home from her kidney transplant my mother had developed this evil rotten attitude. Since the surgery her personality has changed. She is on a ton of meds and I'm afraid these have changed her brain chemistry. (just assuming but whatever). 

My mother has had an amazing life, wealthy upbringing, loving successful children, loving grandkids (she has 6 little ones). She spends most of her days shopping. and doing whatever she wants. my father is very loving towards her. (he has always worked ridiculous hours, so this hasnt negatively affected their long 40 yr relationship)

Additional info: I've noticed my mother only bullies me and my grandmother (her mother). the first 2 years she desperately tried to hide her crazy tendencies from the rest of the family, and would only lashout in private. Now she can't really control herself and the cats out of the bag. No one really cares to fix her probelm because no one has to deal with it except me, and occasionally my grandmother. everyone just kinda shrugs it off, blaming her age. everyone just tells me to be strong and not to let her bother me. 

Also, this has been happening for 3 years, but it has gotten worse this past year, only because we have moved into a new home, our old home had many stairs and it was easy for me to keep my distance from her. Also sound didnt travel far in our old house. In our new home, there are less stairs and sound carries much easier throughout the house.

SHe takes advantage of this by coming and pounding on my door when ever she feels. ""Just to see what i'm up too"", she'll also talk badly about me, to herself, knowing i'll be able to hear her.

She also comforts herself using projection. she's beginning to lose her hearing, so her new thing is that she's trying to convince me i'm deaf. 

when she first came home from her kidney transplant, her short term memory and vocabulary became absolutely terrible. I didnt mind because i know she's been through alot, but she began doing everything in her power to convince me i'm an idiot. 


I'm desperate for help, hope all this is coherent. Thanks in advance!

zwz0u,0,2012-09-15,IAMA PhD Student in Structural Engineering...have gained some decent insight of the program and the field. ,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zwz0u/iama_phd_student_in_structural_engineeringhave/,"I have been in the PhD program for SE for about 1.5-2 years now. I feel like I have an idea of what the program is like, and a vague idea of what to expect from here on out. I also have internship experience. I believe that I have an idea of how one should approach their time as an undergraduate engineering/CS student and beyond, and I would like to share my experiences with anyone who is interested. Feel free to AMA.

When I first started, I had NO idea what to expect or what I eventually wanted to do. My current research is radically different from anything I ever expected to do. That being said, I think it has been a great experience so far, and now it all seems to be coming together.

All this aside, I honestly feel that my education is incomplete. Although I am learning great things and delving deeply into my field, I feel that my knowledge in other fields (economics, biology, history, philosophy, english/literature) remains underdeveloped. I am currently trying to find a way to ""bring balance to the force"", if you will, and try to learn as much as I can beyond what my degree can offer. If anyone has some opinion on that, please feel free to share that as well :)

I don't know how I can prove that I am who I say I am (is it really needed in this case?). If you have any suggestions as to how I can provide proof, please let me know. I'd rather keep my name/location/institution/research a secret, if you don't mind."
zwxxu,1,2012-09-15,Need help resisting,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/zwxxu/need_help_resisting/,"Hi.  I need help resisting, and I'd appreciate any material to help motivate me to resist (drug addiction documents or adverse effects of smoking, stories, etc.)

If I get caught smoking marijuana I'll be kicked out of the house, with no means of providing for myself.  I am completely dependent on my parents for the time being and I just can't afford for that to happen.  My sister is currently ""kicked out of the family"" and my family means just that: no house, no financial support, nothing.  My family will at times be suspicious, it can be anything and sometimes not even substantial, like me being irritated and my uncle threatens to drug test.  The last time this happened was two months ago.  I was playing too much Diablo3 so my uncle suspected I'm smoking weed. I confessed to having smoked a spliff,  and my uncle hasn't mentioned it to my father, but if the suspicion arises again and I can't pass a drug test, my life will be over.  So the consequences of smoking are severe for me.

I find that on my own, I'm completely able to resist.  The temptation comes from time to time but I just ignore it.  On my own, I'd already be two or three months clean.  

The problem is when my brother is around.  He's more of an addict than I am.  At times he says he's done with it, or when I tell him I regret having done it, he says he's going to stop as well, but he never does.  When it's available just one door down from me, when it's right there, accessible and everything, I have a hard time resisting.  After that last incident with my uncle, I went three weeks without smoking until my brother and I went on a trip together.  First thing he did was get more weed and I joined him in it, thinking ""one more week of this won't hurt.""  We were both planning on quitting after the week was done, and called it our last shabang.  He is going to go to a medical internship in October, and he wants to end the habit before that happens.  

But then when we got back in town, he wanted to get more.  I had a hard time stopping as well, but then I stopped when he left town.  Then he came back in town and there it was again.  He left on Wednesday to go do some things out of town, and I haven't smoked since then.  Today he returned, with 5g of herb.  I'm sitting in my room, actively resisting.

The better part of me knows I can't be engaged in that kind of thing.  The consequences are too high to warrant the high that weed gives me, and I'm fine without it.  The sooner I can test clean on a drug test, the better.  When I'm independent again, I can reassess it.  However, I end up justifying it each time in the past, and I don't want it to happen again...thinking ""ok, one more dance with mary jane and then I'm going to stop..."" or ""...my uncle hasn't brought it up in some time, I can probably get away with it"" or ""if I do it just for two nights, it should be out of my system within two weeks...I probably won't get tested in two weeks"" or my best one: ""He's never actually taken me to get a drug test...I've just confessed each time he wanted me to go do it (and got in a load of shit).  Maybe if I don't confess, he won't actually test me..maybe it'd be hard for him to...his daughter smokes all the time and he has threatened to test her but he never has and she keeps on smoking.""  But that's a lot of risk to take, and I can't afford to be kicked out of my family.  It'd just be a lot easier if everyone around me didn't smoke, but that's not going to happen.

So, please, anything that can encourage me to resist while amidst it would be of great help.  Thanks.

EDIT:  TL;DR: Need help resisting weed when it's easily available every day."

zwtr9,1,2012-09-14,[critique] Cover Letter for Political Internship,[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/zwtr9/critique_cover_letter_for_political_internship/,"This is a very, very rough draft. I threw it together in about 45 minutes and am just looking for some very basic, preliminary feedback to begin refining the cover letter. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. I left out all the addresses and did some obvious censoring. If that hinders any context, I apologize.

Dear Ms. XXX, 

It comes as no surprise, the birth of my daughter two and a half years ago sculpted my outlook on life and gave me new found appreciation that I had not had prior. The experience provided scope and scale to people helping their fellow man, be it in any shape or fashion. It was also the catalyst for new found motivations to help others less fortunate, change the political climate of America and to perform as best I can in anything I do. The three of these have led me to the pursuit of an internship within a political setting, not just for academic credit but, because I feel the experience will assist and compliment all my efforts in those three settings.

With these being my motivations, I feel I would make a great asset to Senator XXX’s administrative team and the United States Senate as whole. In my three years of collegiate classes at XXX University in the field of mass communications, and various classes at XXX XXX College, a junior college in Illinois, I feel I have obtained excellent writing skills. Also in my studies of political science at XXX University and XXX College, I have gained a vast knowledge of the political process. An internship with Senator XXX and his/her staff would only help this knowledge grow and enable me further in the future. In addition to classes relating to the political and communication process, I have previous internship experience in a public relations setting. Also, I have written for my high school, junior college and university’s campus newspapers. Participating in the New York Times sponsored “Times Talks” luncheons have advanced my understanding of international and current affairs. Those luncheons have cultivated a need to stay informed that should be instilled within everyone. An internship with Senator XXX would help satisfy this need. 

My previous employers have also helped build my ideologues on helping others. My first job started it; a simple job of refueling airplanes at my local airport. I recall when a pilot crashed into the on-site fuel pumps. Fearing a fire, I ran to the wreckage with a fire extinguisher in hand. No fire resulted but the pilot’s safety, and his gratitude for my concern of his safety, had a reciprocal effect on me. I felt good about caring for others. This carried on through various jobs resulting in customer service. The most recent of which, working for a local rental car company, allows me to have a direct impact on patrons’ satisfaction and safety. Although fairly basic, this element is rewarding. The next, big step is to the world of politics where I could help the masses. Not just a few.

For all of this, I would be honored to be presented the opportunity to work with a monumental leader like Senator XXX. I will be happy to call directly to discuss any opportunity given as the term I am applying for approaches. If you or any of your staff wish to contact me, I can be reached at ###-#00-9##4 or emailed at turtlewaxer99@myschool.edu. I look forward to speaking with you and your staff.

Sincerely,

zwqg5,1,2012-09-14,Student teaching semester leads to worst time of my life.  Stick with it or change jobs / careers again?,storyblue,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zwqg5/student_teaching_semester_leads_to_worst_time_of/,"I've graduated with a journalism degree years ago.  After a year of not landing a job, I decided to go back to college for a Teacher Education certification and become a school teacher.  

While taking Teacher Education classes, I landed a summer job in a big hotel (I hate it) to try to make a little more money.  They offered it to me full time and even gave me a supervisor position.  The pay wasn't great and most of the time I just dealt with dumbass customer complaints, but I got to supervisor a big staff in multiple departments and looked neat on a resume.

Well now I'm in the final semester of the teacher education program, where I become a student teacher under the mentorship of an experienced teacher.  She runs the classroom for the most part, but I start out slow, get involved, get my feet wet, and then eventually I take control of the classroom myself for many weeks. 

Unfortunately because of the demand of what is essentially a teaching internship, I made the hard decision to quit my hotel job.  

I regret it.  My mentoring teacher is a bully with a huge chip on her shoulder.  Her temper makes her very difficult to communicate with, let alone get any advice from her.  This particular week took its toll on me when the last comment she gave me caused me to walk into an office and cry in front of some unsuspecting grown men (other teachers).  She's a great teacher in front a students, but she is not very good as a colleague.  I think I maybe not putting in more effort than I should, but I'm still just learning.  It just sucks feeling so isolated.

Even while I was unemployed, I kept positive.  Now I'm more depressed than I ever remember.  I don't think I want to become a teacher any more, and not just because of my bad experiences with the mentoring teacher.  Every day I come home I look for another job to apply to, something as an Editorial Assistant, medical, technical writing or anything to do with publications where my first passion lies.  I now think I don't have what it takes to be a teacher, and even if I learn to be a good, I think it's currently a terrible industry to be in...overworked, low pay, and tremendous abuse.

SO!!!!!:  Do I try to tough it out, turn this around, and stay optimistic for my future as a teacher, despite my faith in the world of teaching becoming broken?  Or should I try for another career?  Should I even bother trying to find a job that can take advantage of my journalism and team management skills?  What do I have to do to become a part of a scientific, technical, or medical publication?  Should I look into it after I get my teaching certificate, or should I just abandon the teaching quest and go back to school yet again?

Sorry if this got a little unfocused, but I'm emotionally drained and I dread the next day I have to go into that classroom.  I just want to give up and try to find something better, but I feel hopelessly under qualified for anything else that's out there.  I could go back to school, but I don't want to return to this same position.

Please help me or offer some advice / insight during the weakest moment of my entire life.

It's my first reddit post.

Just a quick disclaimer. This is a very long story and I think some of the details are important. If you stick with it and finish it, thank you. If not, I understand.

Last summer I went to another state with my family to aid with a domestic disaster relief effort. We stayed with another family for a week or so, and they were very hospitable. We are both of the Muslim faith, and similar in our degree of practice. They had a daughter, who is 1 year older than me, who I thought was very beautiful from the first moment I saw her. However, we did not get to talk much as we were mostly in a parentally supervised environment. Before I left I was able to get to be friends with her on Facebook. At this point, my feelings for her were just a crush, and I realized that.

Back in my home state, I decided to message her and thank her for her families' hospitality. We ended up talking over fb message, ironically, for about a month. At that point I cut it off and became absorbed in a new semester at my university. Roughly a middle of the way through, she messages me and we begin to talk again. This time, however, I am caught up in other girl issues and am just talking to her normally as if I would any girl. 

As it turns out, the side girl issues fade. But as her and my mom kept in close touch, they invite me back to their home(by myself) for an internship opportunity in their area. So I go their at the beginning of the next year for two weeks.

The first week, nothing happens. Then starting the next week, as the situation would have it, we end up hanging out with each other until the early morning hours watching movies, talking, etc. Each night it seems things get a bit more physical between her and I(I would say she initiated it mostly). I'm talking serious physical, like wrestling and other things, not dinky stuff. The last night before I leave, things get a bit heated and we make out. This is a crucial detail. As a Muslim(not going to debate about whether it was right or wrong) with a more or less traditional mindset and with not too much exposure to women, for me this seems to be a big thing. For her, she had previously been in a relationship for 2 years. However as Muslims we cannot engage in premarital sexual activities, so I don't know how far they got. I talked to her about afterwards, as there would be a large distance between us(multiple states) and we eventually we ""decide"" to keep in touch over facebook so our rents don't find out and banish us to Siberia. 

Mistake #1 --&gt; I should've talked to her about whether or not we were, I suppose, ""together"" or not and expressed what I wanted. However, I didn't and that's what we came up with. fail

I come back and I am completely at a loss as to the status quo. Whether or not we are together, etc as we failed to work that out. As the days go by, she texts me and we talk. However, I never am the aggressor and I do not call her or hit her up as much as she did to me. The texting and calling seems to slow down. Whether she was busy with school or anything else, I have no way of knowing for sure. I talk to my dad (and friends) and tell him everything. He tells me that I should tell her that we can be friends and see where it takes us, as we can't do anything right now(b/c distance &amp; life goals). Some of my friends say similar things. 

Mistake #2 --&gt; should've shown more interest(call, etc)

Valentines day comes along, and I send her flowers with a nice message and some chocolate(most I can do working with the distance). However, that same night I talk to her. I say that I don't know what to do about the distance and about us. She agrees and says shes not ""looking"" for anything right now. However, there is no distinct cut off. No one says that we are not going to talk to each other anymore. I apologize for making out with her the last night b/c of our Islamic restrictions. She says we both share the blame. My feeling for her are the same though. 

Mistake 3 --&gt; Shouldn't have shown uncertainty/followed everyone else's advice

It is interesting to note that when I was with her in person, I was confident, in character, etc. When I came back, I found it hard to display those same things through text or phone call. I'm better in physical interpersonal relations. 

Still feeling the same way I text her, and get more and more pressed, as I realize that she is not exactly showing the same amount of interest as she was earlier. I'd say I text her every 2-3 days. sometimes every day, sometimes every other day. I don't want to crowd her. In a last ditch attempt I invite her to a trip abroad with a humanitarian mission that would be a great opportunity for her and I. I tell her I like her in the message and want to get to know her better, however, I hear nothing back regarding that. 

Eventually I call her and tell her that I still like her and want to make sure we are on the same page. She says she ""likes me as a friend"". Basically I get friend-zoned. 

Against other people's wishes I maintain the invitation to the trip, I'm not a douchebag.Turns out she can come with me for the trip. I'm skeptical as to her motives; it would be a great opportunity and look good on a resume. I cut off communications with her unless absolutely necessary(i.e. pertaining to the trip). She hits me up a few times to talk, mainly about the trip, sometimes not. 

The trip happens, and I'm guilty of still thinking that maybe something will happen. However, I seem to have lost all my confidence that I displayed previously and instead come of as tense. We have an alright time, sometimes she invites me over to watch movies. I don't push the boundary, I stick to what she said/wanted and keep it friendly. We go out on the last night before she leaves. She dresses up, saying that her mom wants her to dress more like a lady. Friends say that it was a sign she thought it was a date. Either way I'm oblivious, dinner goes well but without crazy event. I give her a bracelet I bought at the market earlier as a memento for her for the trip. She says she doesnt want it but I give it to her anyways. I wish her well in her future endeavors, thinking that this will likely be the last time I see her in my life. She leaves the next day. I text her every night afterwards and describe her what I did to make her not feel left out. Eventually I come back to the states.

Mistake #4 --&gt; Tense when I was with her alone; showed lack of confidence. Didn't perhaps make a move. But I wanted to be respectful of her and her wishes. I didn't want to come off as a douchebag. 

I come back home. For some reason she maintains contact. She texts me maybe 1-3 times a month and asks some general questions about me and my life. I don't respond very well as I don't know what to make of it. As time goes on, however, I see the things that happened in an objective light and realize that I still do have some feelings for her. I remember our time together before the intl trip very often. Many times a day in fact. It seems to be bordering on obsession. 

I ask her for the photos she took from the trip for a school report. A friend takes my phone one day and texts her that he wants one of the photos to be of her. she replies with just a what and I save face after retrieving my phone and say it was my high friend. She asks if he is my wingman. I confirm but also point out that he is high. Regardless, this weekend I text her again and she seems to be very friendly. Against my surrounding peers wishes, I chose to end the conversation and not throw any flirtatious bombs at her. 

The problem is, I still have feelings for her. However, shes so far away now and I've botched my chances. Not clearly botched them, but relatively botched. I know getting a girl back via text messaging is stupid, but I don't know how to approach this. I'm not sure if I'm obsessed or what. 

I guess what I want is neutral opinions on what happened. What do you make of it? 

And if I were to continue ""pursuit"" how should I go about it? I'm not a good texter or phone caller. It's just not how I interact well. Is it still even possible with the distance between us? I've heard girls are selective with their time; how does that fit in here?

Or should I just try and let it go? If so, how? I seemingly have not been able to do it for 8 months over a ""small thing"" like making out, but it is what it is. I'm not going to fool myself. 

Thanks reddit for reading. I wont mind any tl;dr comments, because it is lol. I know I'm still a young guy, but I just don't know what to do.

The intern has been going to a german programming school for a while and can hopefully code his way out of a paper bag, but not much more than fundamental concepts of procedural programming (task-centric) and OO on the level of ""class Car : Vehicle"" have been taught. AFAIK they concentrate on teaching the platform (.NET, possibly php) just as soon as they're through with basic language features. I'll be very lucky if they did much more, maybe he's heard of design patterns and some of the more recently introduced (C#) language features - you get the idea.

I am quite experienced and have a broad knowledge, but i am self-taught so i never went through formal CS education, beyond a casual interest in some lectures. So i really don't know very well where to start.

While i have plenty of actual work i could dump on this guy, i want him to actually have a learning experience here.

What i am looking at is basically putting together a small curriculum, starting with evaluating how much he knows and hopefully fixing some bad habits he no doubt picked up, and then some weeks of sitting down and learning something interesting, with practical industry applications (so haskell is ruled out, sorry guys. =D).

What are your ideas - your own experiences while going from beginner to amateur are appreciated. What did you learn that proved useful, what did you wish you had learned that proved useful later?

Some ideas floating around my head:

- Intermediate level OO - working with established design patterns, their uses and limitations, in C#
- Asynchronous programming
- LINQ, anonymous methods, lambda, yield
- Another language, probably python
- c, so he learns pointer arithmetic etc.

A lot of what will actually happen depends on how he picks it up, so don't go into to much detail. Mostly interested in your most positive and negative experiences."

At times they are downright selfish. I am deeply sorry for any pain I have caused to the people involved. I have learned from my mistakes on a level that is profound and truly heartbreaking to myself as well as to others. Please do not down-vote or lecture me on the errors I have made out of niavity, selfishness or shame, I have already paid (and continue to pay) the price for the consequences of my actions in the real world, as I hope you will understand as you read the story...I'll try to make this as short as possible:


About a year ago I (22/F) moved to a new city with my boyfriend (24/M whom we shall call Brad). We had been together for about 2.5 years and living together in Phoenix. We acted as a team, and hoped to be together for the long haul. But money was constantly an issue, and he resented me for it. I was an intern and worked 80 hours a week, so for over a year and a half we didn't spend much time together. Just before the move, I learned of his (failed) attempts to cheat on me while he was out of town. But regardless of our hardships, we still remained together. I quit my internship and we moved to Austin.


Brad and I quickly made friends with our new neighbors. One particularly caught my attention. We'll call him Aaron (37/M). He first interested me because he was an artist, as am I. He began to teach me things about painting, and we would sketch together frequently. 


One night, when Brad had passed out in a drunken stupor, Aaron and I stayed up until the early morning, partying with the neighbors. As the sun began to rise we found ourselves alone, and he began to hit on me. Naively I tried to ignore it, until finally he made a move. At this point I told him no, that Brad was good to me and that I couldn't betray him. The next day Aaron and I talked about it, and agreed that it was just a drunken mistake, and that there was no reason to acknowledge that it had ever occured. I had Brad, and Aaron started a complicated relationship with a girl that lived in Mexico. But the more I thought about it, and the more time I spent with Aaron the more irresistable he became to me. Eventually we began an affair.


The relationship between Brad and I steadily and quickly deteriorated as I began to realize all the reasons we were wrong for each other, and as I became distant, he became suspicious and clingy. Meanwhile the relationship beteween Aaron and I began to grow. In short I had only known him for two months before he called me, saying that he wasn't sure what to do, because he felt like he was falling in love with both the girl in Mexico, and me. Of course, I had been realizing that I was quicking falling for him as well.


About a month after that, Brad and I broke up, and I moved out. But despite not being able to come around, Aaron and I spent the next 6 months nearly attached to the hip. There were many instances in which we decided we couldn't see each other any more, because his relationship with the girl in Mexico continued. On many occasions, he would become suspicious that I was sleeping with other people (I haven't been with anyone else since Brad and I broke up). We tried just being ""just friends"", but found that it was impossible.


We mostly kept our relationship a secret from the people we knew because many of our friends knew Brad, and because some of them knew the girl in Mexico. He rarely talked to me about his relationship with her, but I knew there were arguments, and she even broke up with him for a short time. Then, he told me he was planning on visiting her. He would be going to Mexico for two months. We both knew that when he did, it would be over between the two of us. He wouldn't have a phone, we wouldn't be able to talk. I wouldn't be able to stand knowing he was there with her. But I was in love with him, and I believed he loved me. I can't explain why I believed him. Anyone reading this has probably assumed I'm just a silly girl, and that he was using me. If I were you, that's what I would think. But there's a look and a feeling that can't be faked. And there's months of evidence that there's no way to put into words.


So, when he left for Mexico, I was heartbroken. I cried for days. I only got out of bed to go to work. I ate very little. And then, he messaged me. He told me that he couldn't get me out of his head. And (although most of our conversations revolved either around the fact that no matter how much we love each other, we can't be together so long as she is a part of his life, or about how much we missed each other) we continued to talk for the rest of his stay there. And when he came back, we were back together as if he had never left.


For the last three months we've been inseperable. We spend every minute we can together, to the point of absurdity. We've worked together, we go to the store together, we go to sleep, and wake up together. We have this beautiful relationship, we work on art, play tag in the middle of downtown, we go to galleries and have wonderful discussions, we cook and clean together, we've been accused of knowing each other too well when we began to finish each other's sentences. Our close friends know about and accept our being together, and really, everything is perfect.


Except that, I am the other woman. His girlfriend doesn't know about me. And soon, she is moving to Austin. Their plan is to live together. His plan is to stop seeing me. In fact he's tried to call it off with a increasing frequency since he's come back, and I've tried to respect that (but we can't seem to stay apart). He tells me that he loves me, but that he loves her as well. And I have to give him props for his honesty, as much as it hurts. Personally, I'm appalled that I find myself in this position. I'm not a cheater, and before I would NEVER have been ""the other woman"". I'm ashamed of myself, and I feel a soul crushing guilt for what I've done, both to the girl in Mexico, and to Brad. Her living a thousand miles away seemed to offer me just enough of an excuse to continue, but I know that my conscious and my jealousy won't allow me to continue to see Aaron when she is actually here. But more than this I know that I love Aaron with all of my heart, and that my heart simply cannot let him go. 


I know that he loves me, and that this isn't just some fling he's using to pass the time. I know that he's conflicted about leaving me. I know that he's afraid of losing me, and also afraid of losing her. I know he's torn in two. These are things I KNOW beyond a shadow of a doubt. There isn't any way to explain how I know. What I don't know, is what I should do. How do you give up on someone you love? How hard to you try, how much do you give and how long do you wait, before you do?


**TLDR**: I started having an affair with an older man who had a long distance relationship. We fell for each other, but he also loves her. I truly believe that he loves us both. Soon she will be moving here to live with him. Has anyone out there ever been the ""other woman (or man)"" and it worked out? Does any have any advice?


EDIT: Spell Check.

**Update**: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has offered me advice and *constructive* criticism. I never expected so many people would respond. I appreciate those of you who have offered your opinions without judging me...I do that enough for myself. It appears that the majority of you hold no hope for this twisted relationship, and perhaps you're right."
zzged,2,2012-09-16,Anyone else feel this way on meds?,mastaam,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/zzged/anyone_else_feel_this_way_on_meds/,"I'm a 20 y.o female college student, who has been taking ADD meds on and off since elementary school. Right now I'm mostly taking 10mg IR Adderall, but I also have 20mg Vyvanse. I haven't been taking the Vyvanse lately, as when I took it over the summer at my internship it made me feel depressed and anxious. 

On my medicine I feel like I'm never doing enough, and there's always something else that I need to be doing. Everything has to be perfect, and I feel the sudden desire to tackle everything until I burn out. I have also noticed that I feel really compelled to get in contact with people, especially those I've neglected or lost touch with. Since the Adderall isn't a very high dose I always feel the need to pop another one, even if I don't need really to. 

I'm really used to feeling strange on meds (I've tried them all) but I don't like the way they make me feel. I eat and drink a lot of water while taking them, this doesn't really seem to help. I cannot concentrate without my medicine, and the side effects make me very hesitant to take them, despite the fact that I desperately need them. I'm sure I'm not the only one with these feelings, how do you guys deal?

TL;DR: ADD meds make me feel anxious, slightly depressed and over-zealous. I hyper focus on stupid things (both academic and non-academic) and just feel strange over all. How do you guys deal with this? Any personal insight?"

However, I feel like going back to school is what everyone is doing, and when I graduate I'll be in the position of  having the same worthless credentials everyone else has.  The other issue is I **hate** school.  It gives me nightmares, stresses me out and generally makes me want to kill myself.

The other option I've thought about is trying to get some practical experience via internships. Trouble is I'm not sure if this would actually help me find a job in the long run.

It's kind of a combination fo a lot of stuff.

I knew my gf was trans* when we started dating. Even before so. She was pre-everything, and when I took an interest in her I thought that if we ever got intimate we wouldn't have anything like straightforward penetrative sex. To my pleasant surprise I was wrong.

It wasn't long before we moved in together (we're both in college) and everything was great. We're kinky so we'd play a lot, but there was lett physical intimacy by the time summer came around. I felt that part of it was dysphoria. I was fine with that so I just tried my best to be supportive to her.

During the summer I was apart from her for pretty much three months. I was doing an internship in Moscow, and on a daily basis I interacted with pretty much only my co-workers. I was lost, alone, got to skype my gf only a few times a week if that (time difference was a bitch). I felt like I was losing connection to people. I didn't know how to talk to people. How to interact or respond.

We've been back living together post summer for up to two months now. Her libido dropped out completely, she feels almost no need for intimacy, even kisses are generally short pecks. Due to dysphoria (and I'm pretty sure sensitivity) I'm not allowed to touch her chest or butt. She doesn't tell me much of what's going on with her transition and we sat down and talked about that once, she realized she was cutting me out of the loop a bit and that was hurting me, so she said if I ask about anything that's going on she'll tell me.

But it's not the only thing I'm really out of the loop in now. I feel like more and more she won't talk about herself anymore. She does things without talking to me, won't tell me about her current interests. She's gotten into spirit science and I asked her about it a few times. She knows I am an atheist and we've talked a little bit about chakra energy before but she knows I don't believe it. So now she just waves me off with 'it's not your thing' and 'you wouldn't be interested in it'.

She changed the URL on her blog without telling me about it. She'll come home with random stuff or watch new things and just not tell me about them. It's like I'm being separated from her life, piece by piece and I'm loosing myself because I feel dreadfully alone and have absolutely nobody to lean on anymore. And due to my interaction withdrawal during the summer, I've kind of lost the ability to properly socialize now. I will get mood swings, I put on happy faces.

I am miserable. I feel like she cuts me out but not to hurt me or intentionally. She just doesn't know that what she's doing hurts.

I'll live without sex, orgasms, limited to no cuddles and kisses. But if she stops sharing her mind with me, I feel like I'm of no use. To anybody. Ond for the first time in my life, it makes me legitimately ponder on the value of my existence in this world. Although thankfully I logically realize that I will do much more good by staying in this world.

I'm not sure what I'm expecting. I'm not sure if any of you will read this whole thing. I by no means ask you to. I just needed to share a little with somebody, because lately I feel like I can't talk to anybody. Thanks."

When she came back, she brought some tea from Coop which was some of the best tea either of us had ever had. On the website, it is called: 

&gt;""Coop Früchtetee aromatisiert assortiert 4 Sorten 20 Portionen 50g""/""Coop Assorted Flavoured Fruit Tea 4 Sampler 20 Tea Bags 50g""

[and this is what the box looks like](http://imgur.com/BZmnN).

I've looked high and low online and in town here but no such luck. There's even a Swiss store here that sells a lot of Swiss national brands, but I can't find this stuff anywhere, likely due to it being a in-house brand from a grocery store.

Anyway, I'd love to send some stuff from here (we're pretty well known for maple syrup) in exchange for a large case full of the teas I spoke of and linked above. My wife is pregnant now, and I would love to surprise her with a box of this stuff. Please feel free to contact me! Thanks!"
zyof8,3,2012-09-16,I'm starting to realize the priorities I hold in life are not what I truly value. Have you ever had to rearrange your priorities? How did you go about it?,sushiii9,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zyof8/im_starting_to_realize_the_priorities_i_hold_in/,"I am an undergraduate student a few weeks into my senior year. Throughout my time in college I have always been stressed over grades, despite holding over a 4.0 (/4.44) in a difficult field. This past summer during an internship I got to witness my mentors as they functioned in their prestigious jobs. Most of their time was spent at the office, and though some were happy, they were the type that get enough joy in their work that they might be classified as natural workaholics.
 
I understand that this is not always the case. However it hit me that I would not like any job that detracted from my home life, despite the payoffs. During school my life is almost 100% studying with everything else coming second. Now I wish to change so that I spend more time with those I love and maybe relax a little bit on schoolwork (though not losing focus altogether). 

Has anyone else had a period of time when they came to a dramatic realization of this sort? How did you change your priorities? So far it has not been easy, and I find myself struggling to juggle my new wants with the needs of society - getting a job, deciding on grad school, etc. 


Notes:

- I have started changing my life by cutting out high-stress, high reward classes that may make me look better. I have also chosen not to launch myself into a lot of academic societies or take a high-stress job. Though networking is a powerful tool I realize that my resume is not weak enough that it is vital, and the additional stress of social situations (I can present myself well but on the whole I am deeply introverted) is not something I would look forward to. Basically though I have the ability to, I am not going overkill on everything that would make me the perfect candidate for a ridiculously competitive job, since that is not what I want.
- I cannot say that my die-hard focus on grades is a direct result of my upbringing, but there are definitely factors that may have influenced my views. "
zyo4n,5,2012-09-16,"I'm an engineering student, how much is too much student loans debt?",Naxili,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zyo4n/im_an_engineering_student_how_much_is_too_much/,"Hi, I'm a third year astronautical engineering student in a five year program at my school. I recently decided to get serious about my financies, so I'm here to talk about student loans. So, here are my numbers:

**Financial Information**

My mother is unemployed, and has no money to assist me with. None. She's last year she made $16,000 (idk how), and she has 4 kids (including me).

The degree program I'm in gives guaranteed jobs in your field, so long as you have your shit together while your in classes. I do in fact have my shit together, so I'll have a guaranteed job at NASA when I graduate, which pays $60,000/year

I'm currently living with my grandparents, and do not own a car.

I'm currently projected to have $75,000 (high estimate) in loans when I graduate.

I am actively pursing all job opportunities open to me, from minimum wage part time jobs, to work study on campus jobs, to summer internships at NASA.

Now, here is my question. Would it be reasonable for me to take out another $30,000 - $35,000 in loans (total) in order to live on my own? 

On the one hand, that would put my monthly loan payments at roughly 25% of my monthly income, up from about 17%. And most places I've seen say don't exceed 10%.

By the way, a good percentage of my loans are private, so income based repayment will only help me but so much.

**Personal Information**

On the other hand, living at home is stressful, to say that least. It comes down to three things, really. First, I'm in a really bad neighborhood (one of the more ghetto parts of Washington DC) and sometimes I don't get back from classes until 10pm. I haven't been mugged or anything similar for 3 years, but as I take more advanced classes I'm starting to get home later and later so I don't know how long that will last. Second, my commute is roughly 3 hours, round trip, which should speak for itself. Third, I'm an LGBT person. Whether or not that disgusts you is irrelevant. It's important to my financial situation in that if my grandparents find out, I'd say there is a 40% chance they kick me out, 60% chance they add an unbearable amount of stress to my life. Both cases would lead to me having to move out before I graduated anyways. It's unlikely that they will find out, but the danger is still there.

Anyway, all of those issues would go away if I could rent an apartment. Now the question is, would that apartment be which the significant loan cost? Clearly I would prefer to move out, but I am unsure as to whether or not loans eating up an extra 25% of my income (or rather, an extra 8%) for 10 years would leave me so unstable financially that I wouldn't be able to live. I think it won't, since...

**Calculations ($/month)**

+$5,000: Income

-$1,200: Loans

-$1,200: Taxes

-$900: Apartment

-$200: Medical

-$200: Transit

-$200: Food

-$200: Misc

= $900"

I just recently started working for Jumpstart, a program that goes into lower-income preschools and helps provide a quality education for those kids.  Because I'm going to have around 12 hours a week with this job, I asked to only be put on during the holidays at my cashiering job.  However, my parents aren't happy with this and think that I'm not going to get a job during the summer because of this.  

For some background:

*  I'm a Neuroscience major who is taking 3 fairly intensive classes right now, one stupidly easy one and one that unfortunately requires a bit of effort.  I also want some time to see my boyfriend who I don't often see during the week.  I know people can work 30 hours a week and go to school but I'm have a strong need for some non-stressful social interaction.

*  Jumpstart and Big Lots pay the same (I thought my Jumpstart income wasn't taxed but they said it was).  However, Jumpstart is an Americorp program so at the end of my term, I will get a $1175 education award as well as be part of this alumni network.  Heck, I already got a free American Eagle hoodie from there (our team won our pre-job recruitment and I'm not gonna lie, this is the softest hoodie I own).  

*  When I talked to my manager about possibly being on the schedule just one day a week, he said he didn't like that and it would either be no days or two days.  Although 10 hours isn't too bad by itself, you also have to put into account commuting time (which is pretty hefty coming from my college) and that drain of unfulfilling work.  

*  I'm also applying to be a Peer Educator, where I educate people at my college about sexual abuse and rape.  This would cause the same problem as JS with my parents but I want to do this and want to focus on Neuropsych (possibly being a double-major in neuro and psych).  I'd get a stipend and honestly, BOTH of these jobs seem like a much better resume builder than Big Lots.

*  I also realize that I need to talk with our internship office to see if I can get an internship for the summer (plus our college started this guaranteed internship program so I'm theoretically more likely to get one)

What do you guys think?  Should I have ""given up"" my cashiering job or was it impractical of me to do so?  "

I am a recent graduate with a BBA in Accounting &amp; Finance. I have been searching for work since graduating in May and have had little luck. As far as experience goes, I was unable to obtain an internship throughout school due to a heavy academic schedule--between class and extra-curricular activities. I did, however, hold the same part-time position my final three years and a couple of other part-time positions through the same duration--so I do understand what hard work means. I have all of the credentials to acquire my CPA and am considering that path, though not limiting myself to Accounting only. I have a heavy interest in securities, equity, and risk. Also, I am a very naturally analytic person. Furthermore, I am an advanced in all Microsoft Suite applications and hold experience with Peachtree Accounting Software as well as Bloomberg and Factset financial systems. Currently I am located in Kentucky, just south of Louisville. I am available to relocate with assistance/signing bonus.  

Thank you very much for your consideration!"
zyihp,0,2012-09-16,Move across the country and she sent me home,addedpulp,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zyihp/move_across_the_country_and_she_sent_me_home/,"This story is mind-numbing, and I hate writing it out... if I leave things out, my apologies. I've talked to friends, and they just say ""what a bitch,"" but this is a brand new side of her. Prior to this, we dated a year and a half and never had so much as an argument. I'm 26, she's 22.

She graduated college and I'm a freelancer. She got a post-college internship at a place... let's just say it's the happiest place on earth. She asked me to come with her, so I found an apartment I could afford, sold the majority of my unneeded stuff, and started applying to gigs in that area. It's about 1000 miles away. She lived 15 minutes away in the resort's ""housing,"" basically dorms with 6 people per apartment, all the same gender (very family directed resort).

It wasn't long after I got there that I got irritated by how little I saw her, maybe two or three times a week, usually nights, and often times she'd fall right asleep. They work them like crazy, so whatever. Then she started dividing her time between me and her new friends. Irritating, but whatever. I saw her less, which only bothered me because she couldn't incorporate me with her friends. I was there 2 months and only met a few in passing when I was at her apartment... which I wasn't allowed at. She said they ""just don't have boyfriends or boys they like over.""

One week, I saw her very little, and on my way back from a gig, I felt nice, well dressed, and decided to surprise her. She said she was just eating dinner. I knocked on the door and she answered, and seemed very startled. She quickly rushed me back to the car, and when I asked to use the bathroom (several hour drive from the shoot), she told me to pee outside, which she would normally not permit. When I left, she texted me ""sorry for being weird, don't think anything of it.""

She had told me about this pushy, douchey guy from work who liked her because she was the only girl with a boyfriend that wasn't infatuated with him, and he got her number from the employee roster and started texting her. She told me as if it were funny, laughable. Well, at the end of the week where I visited and was ushered out, she came over late and fell right asleep, all her stuff on the bed. She keeps getting texts, and I looked. It was a guy's name I didn't recognize. I proceeded to do two shitty things: I skimmed her texts with him. I was looking for a few things. There was no incriminating language, no real flirting, just bullshitting. However, I was never mentioned, which is what a girl typically does when she wants an aggressive guy to go away. And, the biggest issue, they had hung out every night that week, when she was too busy for me. They also hung out at her place, where I wasn't allowed. This included eating dinner, the night I stopped by.

I confronted her. She was half awake and thought I was being silly. She told me he's just a guy from work. I asked what the guy that liked her was named. It was the same guy. I asked if they had hung out all that week. She said she hung out with friends. I asked if he was included. She said sometimes. She repeatedly told me they were never alone (they both have 5 roommates, so no shit), and that they were just friends. I asked why she needed to keep it from me, and she said simply that she thought it'd upset me to know she wasn't spending her free time with me. Fine.

I then noticed a few days later she was logged in on her FB on my computer. I looked at it a few times in the next month. I didn't read her messages, but I did notice a trend. She spent most of her free time with her roommate. There were several occasions where she told me she was with her roommate, and her roommate had posted photos. I could see the ones of the two of them. However, in three different instances, there were other photos where this guy in question was present. I couldn't see those from my account, only hers. They were never in the same photo together. However, if I asked who she was with, she just said her roommates, or, in one instance where she went to the beach, ""6 people"" (which, judging from the photos, was actually her roommate, the guy her roommate liked, and the afformentioned guy).

I tried a half dozen times to talk to her about why she would lie, why she kept things from me, why I never met her friends. She rarely said a word; that's how she is, and I know that from the few instances where her friends back home got upset with her, but had never experienced it.

Over those conversations, all I got is what I already mentioned, and that her coworkers didn't accept outsiders; when she first started, one of her coworkers brought her boyfriend, and they ousted her and the boyfriend completely. I asked if he moved 1000 miles, and she said ""I don't know, no one talked to him."" Fucking children.

She also said that the whole situation, and being in a position where she now has to worry about the real world, makes her have ""doubts."" She couldn't explain them, but she did say that she ""wondered if this relationship was forever,"" which I said was absolutely moronic, because there's no way to tell, especially when you're so royally failing at ""right now."" I asked her repeatedly if she wanted to end it, she said no. She just hated that I was so dependent on her, which I told her she should have expected asking me to move somewhere where I know no one.

So, I came back home. The night before the last night I was there, she told me she was at her place with her roommate, when I had glanced over at her texting earlier that day and saw her roommate's name, the guy's name, and the name of a bar (she's not a bar person, at all). The next morning, she maintained she was just watching TV when I went to bed, but I looked on her facebook the next morning (from her account, isn't visible from mine) and her roommate had posted a picture of them in dresses that said ""before we go out tonight."" I confronted her about it, claiming I noticed the dress in her room, and she said she didn't wear the dress out, and that she never LIED, she just didn't tell me what she did after I went to bed. She almost seemed proud of it, like it was cute. She since changed her fb password, so her fb activity has appeared as if she hasn't been tagged in anything to me since.


I visited from friends. They gave me awful ideas, namely about that guy, or that she intended to send me home so she wouldn't have to end it in person, like a coward. I got furious. I got in the car and drove back to talk to her. About halfway, I realized it was insane, and texted her saying I did a crazy thing that day that I'd tell her about that night. I still had (and have) and apartment there. I showed up, expecting to catch her hanging out with that guy. She wasn't, she said he ""confronted"" her about his ""feelings,"" she said no, and he told her they couldn't be friends. I asked her why she felt building that relationship was acceptable, and she said she thought it was harmless if he didn't get the wrong idea. I told her he must have, and he must have thought I was pretty insignificant, if he thought his plan would work. I later spoke to her best friend about it, and she said she just can't let people down; she tries to make friends out of boys that are after her and it always ends up with a pissed off guy.

I thought that my showing up would shock her into honesty, or at least make her give me some time. Nothing. I spent more time at the coffee shop that weekend using the internet than with her; she went out with her friends several times (granted, she had plans, but I would drop mine if she showed up on my doorstep), and we only ended up actually talking for a few hours. The last night I was there, I took her to dinner, and after she tried to go home. I straight ahead told her that was absolutely unfair, and she made me take her to coffee shop to use the internet because I had mine uninstalled. Absolutely childish stuff; I guess avoidance can go to crazy lengths, or she really felt it insignificant.

I asked her repeatedly if she was intending to break up with me, and sending me home to make it easier. She said no, she just wanted me to have people to hang out with. She then told me she wanted to ""Wait for her"" until her internship was over. I told her I would, but considering all I did and how she treated me, I found it incredibly unfair. All she had to say was she must have only been thinking about the fun we'd have there (which we had little of, since her friends got all her free time) and not the commitment it meant.

So I came back. I've been back about 2 weeks and every day I get upset about something else. We text, that's about it. Lots of texts, but considering she avoids talking about issues, and she's vague about what she's doing socially, there's little to talk about. Every time I get upset (generally because she's out socializing and it reminds me that I had to come home for her to do that without guilt, or because I try to coax out something romantic or sweet and get little back), she tries to tell me she does care, and she is trying, but I tell her words mean little when actions are scarce. Granted, we didn't talk much the month or two before we individually moved down there, but I was moving out of my apartment of 3 years, finishing up work, selling my belongings, etc... and worry makes time go much slower, or I wouldn't be typing this.

I don't even really know what advice I expect. I just had to tell someone that wasn't a friend who says ""what a bitch"" and then gets high. I felt like I was taking a big step in my life and now I'm on a friend's couch. I don't want to split up, but she's really fucked up my trust in her. I hate that, now, every time she goes out, I get angry because I think she might be lying or telling half truths. I get angry that that did nothing and get her in person and I gave everything and get texts. I have the apartment still, and considered asking if she wants me to come back and try fresh now that she's settled, but she keeps telling me to ""build my career"" here, which is one of her ""doubts,"" that I'm 26 and freelancing... but that just infuriates me that she asked me to drop my clients here and then expects me to get them back again that the season is over. I don't know why she's trying to keep it going if she doesn't want me, which she says she does, that she wants to ""miss me."" I have no clue.

TL;DR: Fuck."

What other things should I be including? I heard I should put some coursework on there but where? Under my university? Should I put courses currently in progress or only ones I've completed? I also made dean's list, include that anywhere?

Also, I'm a candidate for Beta Alpha Psi (accounting frat) but I'm not a member, should I include that on the resume? In the same vein, I've been invited for Accounting Honors, but I'm not in officially yet, so should I leave that off as well? I also just got a job as a finance intern, but I haven't started work yet, include that anywhere? Also, I started participating in martial arts at the university, include that in a section?

I also studied computer/electrical engineering for two years at uni. I can program a bit in Java/C++ (and yes, more than just ""Hello world!"", and I'm OK with JavaScript (and HTML/CSS), is there any place for that on the resume?

What sort of numbers should I put on the resume to stand out?

I know the ""Objective"" section is controversial, but if I do keep it, should I repeat the job I'm applying for as in this example, or specify it down to ""Obtain tax internship with accounting firm"".

[Have you ever seen any indication that this ""Maria"" is financially exploiting your dad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68k3sb?context=5)|Not really. I mean my dad certainly has treated her well and buys her things but nothing too extravagant and she seems like the type of person who doesnt really care about material things. Who knows though, there could be a side of this story im not aware of. She's been nothing but nice to me. I dont have many negative things to say about her other than shes the one who introduced my dad to it. I dont solely blame her for it because my dad made his own decision to believe in these things. 
[I mean, I liked that show ""V"" and all, but there are limits. Is your dad into all that orgone and chemtrail stuff? Can you tell us a little bit more about what your dad actually believes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j9de?context=5)|Yes big believer in that chemtrail stuff. Heres a bit more into what he believes.
 |He believes that the world is run by reptilian humanoids from another dimension that control every aspect of human life.
 |He believes that many high ranking people such as george bush, the queen, etc. are these reptilians.
 |He believes that the world governments are going to come together and create the New World Order.
 |He believes that the NWO will try and get the worlds population down to 500 million for better control over the people.
 |He believes that America will be a police state any time now. ( which I actually somewhat believe to a certain extent)
[He probably knows all about the Georgia Guidestones, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kf7b?context=5)|If those are those messages on the rocks or whatever then yes he showed me those before. Sorry to oversimplify it but im a bit hazy on the details of them. 
[Has your Dad ever tried to y'know, convert you? I can imagine that being a highly awkward conversation. If so, how did you respond? Did you ever give his ideas any credence? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j974?context=5)|Yes, he tried to convert me many times. It was honestly the weirdest thing Ive ever experienced the first time he tried. I think most people get the view of their parents as the super responsible and unflappable people and when one of your parents basically starts talking crazy its a very very scary situation. I cant say i ever did give his idea any credence.
[Well you stay strong man, you're right about a person of responsibility completely whacking out on you like that. Naht good.  Still as long as he respects your (sane\) views, then I'm sure you can still enjoy a decent relationship right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jd1x?context=5)|Yea i mean he understands that he'll never get me to believe in it and he respects those beliefs. We talk very rarely but when we do its respectful and i still love him very much and want nothing more than to just have a normal father son relationship. 
[I am not trying to be a dick because I am a huge conspiracy theorist but did your dad have any sudden behavior changes or any signs of neurological problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j1fl?context=5)|Valid question, no dickishness sensed. I cant say i noticed any neurological problems, but honestly he did seem happier. He suddenly went from a guy who was completely emotionally shut down to being very open.
[The dicksense is strong with this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kuu7?context=5)|Yea this one was hiding from me for a while. Well played sir, well played.
[So does your dad see the John Carpenter film ""They Live"" as a documentary instead of science fiction?  (Highly recommended movie BTW\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jlgg?context=5)|Never seen it but after doing some investigative research (wikipedia) it seems right up his alley. I'll definitely have to check it out though, it looks pretty cool. 
[How old is your dad?  We're his parents old fashion?  Does his family have any history with paranoia?  Along with getting spiritual guidance has he or is he on any medication or other ""drugs""?  Does he think Obama is a reptile?  Has he ever came face to face with one?  Also, I do not mean to offend you in any way. I am just trying to understand the whole situation. I have an open mind about most conspiracies.  Do you believe him?  How has the situation changed your life?  Are you upset about the whole thing?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j6af?context=5)|My dad is in his 50's. His parents were very old fashioned, my grandpa was the typical hard working american of the 50s and 60s who worked on telephone lines his whole life and my grandma was the typical stay at home mom. No history with paranoia as far as i know. As far as drugs go I always thought he at least smoked weed but as it turns out he is very much against drugs of any kind really. Hes never come out and blatantly said Obama is a reptile but i think he thinks so, he says that basically most presidents and politicians are. Do i believe him? if you mean do i believe he genuinely believes in this stuff, I do. The situation greatly changed my life. The whole thing started when we were really actually beginning to get close and hang out more. He was never around much when i was little because he always traveled for work. What upset me the most was when he decided to up and leave and move permanently to his other house with no explanation when i was 14 years old. 
[OP what would your dad think if you got a government job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jwwk?context=5)|He would either A. Shun me forever or B. Ask me to uncover some secret information. I wish i was joking about that answer hahah. 
[I would use it as an opportunity to troll him. I would start acting secretive and talk in a monotone voice around him. Especially if it was like a really low level govt. job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jz1m?context=5)|Brilliant plan. Yea like even if i worked in some non exciting gov. job like Sanitation, i would wear one those ear buds and pretend to talk into it very quietly. Plus sanitation gets all the hot interns. 
[Where is the proof about the lizard beings?  What is your dad's ultimate goal? To expose the lizards? Does he have a plan of action?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68k906?context=5)|As far as I know , and anyone can correct me if im wrong, they really dont have proof aside from stupid youtube videos. Its basically a religion where its a belief and there defense is that you cant disprove it. As far as my dads ultimate goal, its basically to make as many people aware of it as possible and to expose the lizard people and i guess somehow that will give them less power. 
[How do you detect a lizard person? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jdkp?context=5)|Well, from my understanding you can tell by the eyes hahah. Apparently there are videos on youtube that prove that people like George H W Bush are reptilians but they way there eyes look. 
[What was it like inside the house?  What did your dad do while staying there?  Does he still do this currently?  Do you still talk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j3xc?context=5)|It was actually a really cool house, but i mean pretty normal. It was kind of weird being there because my dad would be like normal and we would just hang out and watch movies or play golf but then he would go into weirdo mode and start forcing these beliefs on me by showing me these insanely long and boring videos about all this. He is still a firm believer. We rarely talk anymore and if we do only by email, it really hurts because i love him to death but i just cant get on board with this. 
[My friend has recently leapt into this theory as well. Letting it consume, most of his entire day-to-day happenin's.  It also coincides with some pretty significant life changes, his sister had an injury ending her dancing career, his parents lost their home, and he's always had a good deal of paranoia.  Do you have any advice as to how I can approach this change? Or, if it's simply a lost cause.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jo8z?context=5)|Im very sorry to hear that, its always tough seeing someone close to you do something bizarre. My advice to you is to be there for him / her and try and get them to talk about those life changes. My feeling, atleast in this case is that your friend is closing himself off to the problems and it is manifesting in this belief. Your friend is basically burying their head in the sand to perhaps avoid these problems. So as hard as it may be to see your friend like this, stick with them and try and get them to talk it out. Hope that this helps in any way.
[That is certainly helpful.  That's for the most part what I've been doing. It just, becomes, a major point of contention when it seems to be all he wants to talk about.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68js4x?context=5)|Yea it really does consume their lives. But stick with it and i wish you the best. 
[Does your father have any plans for these reptilian humanoids? Is his group planning some kind of resistance against the creatures? Does he believe that average people can also be a reptile?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jwlz?context=5)|As far as i know there arent really any plans of a resistance or any such thing. He believes that being a reptile means you are going to be either famous or powerful, so no, its apparently very exclusive. 
[Is ""Reptile"" a euphamism for something else? Like the British monarchy? Or Jews? or is it actually that he believes in freaking REPTILES?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kphc?context=5)|No the actual belief is the people are reptilian humanoids from another dimension. No bullshit, that is what they actually believe. 
[I'm presuming you mean the Annunaki when you say reptilians?  Does he also believe in Nibiru?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68k0ce?context=5)|Yes, Annunaki is what i speak of. As far as Nibiru yes he does believe that although he never got to much into detail about it so im not 100% sure exactly what thats all about. 
[Does it have a negative impact on his personal life?  Does he stay closed up in his house? does he work? does he socialize with friends?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jojb?context=5)|The thing about his situation is he doesn't fit the typical conspiracy theorist, hes not always holed up in house plastering thousands of pictures on a wall and connecting them with strings. He lives a fairly normal life i would say. Hes a business consultant and he travels alot still. That being said he does have a lot of down time when not traveling and does usually spend it at home with his SO (yea just realized i didnt explain this fully but he still lives with Maria the spiritual healer). 
[Reptiles... what a fruitcake! They are crab people.  Craaab people, craaab people, craaab people, craaab people, craaab people, craaab people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jf5g?context=5)|There have an upvote, i literally laughed out loud at this. 
[Does he ever get angry with you if you disagree, or refuse to believe him ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j8h8?context=5)|He would get testy sometimes when I would say basically that hes in a cult and I couldnt be a part of it. I remember one time when he was trying to get me to watch some whacko video he had, i refused and he started yelling basically saying that if i choose not to watch then i would be making my life harder by becoming a slave to them. The few times he did get mad though it genuinely seemed like he wanted to help me and in his mind the way to help me was to get me to believe like he does. 
[Valid question, no dickishness sensed. I cant say i noticed any neurological problems, but honestly he did seem happier. He suddenly went from a guy who was completely emotionally shut down to being very open.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j43j?context=5)|Also I consider myself a bit of a conspiracy theorist as well but I simply could not even begin to wrap my mind around this theory. 
[I gather it's more believable because Icke can talk for three days solid on the topic. No facts mind you, but for three days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68llip?context=5)|Seriously, he travels to a lot of schools and such to put on presentations and they last upwards of ten hours in some cases. 
[Hey man, I have a brother who believes in that stuff too, last 8 years now actually, it's tearing my family apart too, just thanks for reminding me there's people out there who are going through this shit too. I hope you and your family work things out man. Love from Dublin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kndw?context=5)|Thanks man, appreciate the kind words and I wish you and your family the best.
[Mid life crisis my friend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j575?context=5)|Hahaha, funny you say that because this all started when my dad was having his mid life crisis. It started as the normal crisis where he bought a sports car and all that crap and then went to this. But i think hes beyond the crisis point and is still a firm believer in this conspiracy.

I had struggled with porn and faping since I was 12 and the longest I ever went before was a week and that was because I was at a youth camp. Porn had destroyed so many opportunities. I constantly struggled with social anxiety. I was never in control of my emotions and would direct my outbursts at those that I love the most. So I took up the challenge and I lasted 21 days! I could think better, I was in control, I was the man I always wanted to be.

Then I came home. Lasted about a week before I went back to my old habits. And now I'am back where I was before the summer. My motivation is gone even worse than before. I can't talk to people. The only good thing is that I have been able to keep my workout regiment. 

I'am back where I was. I will rise and damn it this time I will not fall. And if I do fall I will not lay in my misery of self pity. I will rise a new with my teeth and claws covered in the blood of the old me."

zyaid,35,2012-09-15,My mom (45F) is sleeping with her friend's son (22M) and it's bothering me. Why am I (22M) bothered and how do I deal with this?,upsetson,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zyaid/my_mom_45f_is_sleeping_with_her_friends_son_22m/,"First of all, please don't think there is ANY incestual thing going on here with what I'm thinking and how I feel. But I still don't know the reason for how I feel and was hoping I can get some input on how to deal with it.

I just got back from a 6-month internship in Chicago for work about 2 weeks ago and will be living with my mom for a while until I save up enough money to move out. Last night, I get home earlier than expected from a friend's house and decide to go to my room upstairs and watch some tv for a bit. As I walked by my mom's room, I heard her talking to someone whose voice sounded really familiar. I have no freaking clue why but my dumbass decided to look through the crack in the door. When I did, I saw my mom and her friend's son fully naked walking into her bedroom shower together.  I know, stupid move on my part but I wasn't thinking when I decided to look.

Right there, I felt sick to my stomach. I went into my room where I began to hear faint sex noises coming from my mom's bathroom. I felt like shit, was upset, and a little bit jealous in an over-protective way. Again, I have no weird feelings like that for my  mom whatsoever but I don't know why I was feeling the way I was. Anyway, I hid in my room until he left, I began to feel sick about what I just found out. 

My mom's friend's son and I went to the same high school and were in the same grade. But we were never friends (not in the same social circle) but we weren't enemies either. But finding out that he is screwing my mom pissed me off and makes me dislike him. As childish as this sounds, it makes me want to screw his mom as payback. I only told my really close female friend about this and she said that my ""jealousy"" and anger might stem from the same over-protective feeling any guy has when someone says a ""your mama"" joke to him. Like I feel like the guy is using or ""defiling"" my mom's body for his pleasure. I know, sounds stupid but she may have had a point.

Should I confront my mom about me knowing? Should I confront the guy without getting into any physical altercations? Do I have a right to feel upset about this? How do I deal with this? If anyone has an idea, let me know. Feel free to PM me too if you're afraid you'll get downvoted to oblivion I guess. I just need some input. Thanks.

TL;DR - Mom is sleeping with her friend's son (an old high school classmate) and it's bothering me. How do I deal?"

I have a background in restaurants, my family owns two pizzerias, I worked in them and other restaurants throughout my adolescence and early 20's, working the line, etc.

Here's what I want.  I want to learn how to **really cook**, I mean really well.  I want to become a great chef at home, and who knows, in the end I may want to work again in a restaurant.  

Here's the deal - you teach me to become a chef.  I want to learn proper techniques, skills, and tricks I wouldn't learn anywhere else other than from another chef.  If you teach me in your restaurant I will work for free - a few days a week, an internship if you may. 

I'll do prep work, I'll do crap work, I'll clean, I don't care - as long as in the end I am learning how to cook and become a chef.

zy9p8,81,2012-09-15,A thank you to nurses (VERY long but I want to thank you for changing our lives.),giraffeplusahalf,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/zy9p8/a_thank_you_to_nurses_very_long_but_i_want_to/,"Two years ago on September 11th, I was called at 4:30 am by my boyfriend's roommate, he told me that my boyfriend was drunk and he needed help.  I got out of bed and drove to my boyfriends house to find him on the floor having a fit of seizures, throwing up, and basically emptying every possible bodily fluid on the floor of his room- and immediately called an ambulance (I was furious at his drunk idiot roommate for not calling an ambulance before calling me, and for somehow mistaking this for 'drunk').  There was blood in his ears and nose.  I was terrified.  I had no idea what was going on, seeing as at this point in my life I was finishing my last semester as an art student and preparing to head out to California for an internship at an animation studio.  My boyfriend was passing in an out of death, and becoming increasing more unresponsive as time went on.  I did what I could remember of CPR from when I was forced into CPR certification classes when I Was in girl scouts as a child.  It felt like an eternity went by while waiting for the ambulance.  The paramedics came in, took him and left into the ambulance.  Four more ambulances showed up over the next ten minutes, and each pair of people piled into the one ambulance, every time the door opened I could see him being defibrillated, intibated, and fussed over.

He was life flighted immediately to a bigger hospital, and one again to an even bigger one, and yet another, eventually ending him in Pittsburgh's UPMC presby.  I followed him in my car across Pennsylvania, crying and completely unaware of what was going on. I heard everything from doctors claiming that he must have been using heavy drugs (I would tell them he wouldn't touch drugs, but no one believed me), to a stroke, to an aneurism- but no one knew.  When he arrived at UPMC I was informed quickly that my boyfriend had been born with an AVM, and had never suffered any symptoms, so when it ruptured it came out of nowhere. 

Over the next week I lived out of the waiting room, and eventually a hotel room waiting to hear what would happen.  My boyfriend couldn't talk clearly, and was experiencing living memories in his room from our previous trips to Pittsburgh, such as giraffes and elephants. (Before all this) He was very confused, and only slept when I was there with him holding his hands.  He lived in UPMC's ICU for a full week waiting to have a massive soft ball sized blood clot removed from his skull so he could beginning attempting to heal.  No one attempted to even pretend he would make it, some of the nurses couldn't even look me in the eye while I sat for hours next to his bed (he wouldn't let them place, or remove IV's without me there, insisting that he would die if I were to leave).  His vital signs faded in and out, as he was pumped full of drugs all day, every day.  After a week he had become as stable as anyone could have hoped, so they took him in for surgery.  I was so scared that the last time I would ever see him was now, him with tubes in his skull, tubes in his throat, tubes in his nose, and me with my head on his lap trying not to cry, while I told him I loved him and would be there the whole time.  He told me he loved me, and they rolled his bed down the hall.

There were no complications, and he came out of surgery, and was returned to his room in a drug induced coma.  The nurses told me he was sleeping and he would be for a while, so I sat quietly at his bed side and talked to him.  He woke up saying my name, and his nurses came rushing in to help him and do their inspections of him.  His blood clot was removed, the trouble zones cauterized, and his skull stapled and stitched.  

Over the next three days, my boyfriend's nurses tried to teach him how to do simple movements again.  He was left with full paralysis on his left side, to the extent that he couldn't move his face, see out of his left eye, or even release his arm from a clenched fist.  He could talk, and he remembered everyone, but was still fully confused about where he was.  All of his nurses were more than either of us cold have ever asked for.  They talked to him, they laughed with him, they talked to me even.  I remember one time I got so upset I went out and sat in the hallway on the floor by the bathroom and cried.  One of his nurses came out and sat next to me, put her arm around me and told me how much he needed me, and told me how important it was for me to be strong for him, so he could be strong for me sometime when I needed him.  I dried my eyes and re entered my boyfriend's room to find him laughing and joking with one of his male nurses, as the nurse was using a mirror to show my boyfriend his stitches and staples on his head and asking if he knew what they came from.  My boyfriend told the nurse that it was from a helicopter blade that sliced his head open in 'Nam.  (my boyfriend was 25 at the time- and was not in any wars- he works as a cook.) The male nurse laughed, as the two of them made up fake stories about the war, and talked as if they were best buds.  This nurse was so amazing with my boyfriend, laughing and talking, asking about life, sharing dog stories and pictures (they both had dogs), he asked my boyfriend every time he entered the room if he remembered what happened, and why he was there (probably close to fifty times a day for three days straight) until he finally could remember why he was there.  Another one of his nurses had a fabulous sense of humor, she understood how embarrassing it was for my boyfriend to be incapable of helping himself do anything, and went out of her way to make sure he felt comfortable.  I remember one time she came into his room and asked him if she could get him anything and he replied by touching my face with his functioning arm and saying no.  He then proceeded to get a full on erection, and then turned red and apologized- she laughed and said cheerfully to us ""well at least we know that still works!!"" Her fabulous sense of humor for things that otherwise would have been hugely embarrassing for someone made it possible for my boyfriend to feel okay about the things happening to him.

 There were four nurses specifically that went WAY out of their way to be great to my boyfriend, not only by providing amazing medical help, but also by being his friend- they didn't treat him like a problem they wanted to get away from, but instead they treated him like a person, with family, friends, thoughts, and emotions.  After about a week and a half (it seemed like months) my boyfriend was moved to a physical therapy rehab hospital in our home town.  When he left we was carted out on a bed, unable to move his left side still. (not even a finger wiggle.)  

The paramedics saved my boyfriend's life, and the nurses kept him alive and through their care, and hard work made it possible for him to be who he is today.  He since, has regained full movement, is finishing his final year at college, working at his job full time again, and is now acting strong for me while I go through nursing school (that nurse was right).  These nurses (at UPMC and Health South, his rehab facility) not only helped my boyfriend but they made me realize that I had made the wrong career path choice when I initially went to college.  I am now enrolled in nursing school and am on my way to becoming an RN.  I have hopes of one day being able to provide even HALF of the support, knowledge, kindness, and expertise of these nurses who changed both my life, and life of my boyfriend.  

On the off chance that even one of his nurses is not only on this website, but is able to identify with, and remembers this situation and my boyfriend and I, from both of us we would like to say Thank you.  He is unable to remember you, or any of his stay at UPMC, but I will remember you for the rest of my life.  You changed two lives for the better, and I want you to know how grateful and appreciative of you, and your hard work we both are.  We recently made a visit to the hospital, hoping that we might find some of you to say thank you in person, but we failed.  

If you are by some chance one of his nurses, I wanted to write this to say thank you, and to let you know that all of your hard work helped my boyfriend to regain movement, and he is living a normal life two years and four days later.  All of you nurses are some of the most amazing people on Earth, and even if you didn't have anything to do with my boyfriend's brush with death and recovery, I want to thank you too for every little thing you do at work every day- even if you think it goes unnoticed, just remember-  there may be someone like me who notices it, and appreciates it more than you may ever know.

For the bottom of my heart, Thank you."
zy6u7,22,2012-09-15,Niece caught wife and lover. How do we deal with this?,Dilemmaguy100,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/zy6u7/niece_caught_wife_and_lover_how_do_we_deal_with/,"I wasn't really sure what subreddit to post this in but I decided this is the best one. I think I need to give you some background first so please bear with me. My wife and I don't necessarily fit in the traditional poly lifestyle but we're also not lving the traditional cuckold lifestyle. 

My wife [43f] and I [45m] have been married for 20 years and have one daughter, 19, whose in college. We have had a great marriage and continue to do so to this day despite our situation. About 5 years ago, I had a very bad injury that pretty much rendered my testicles useless for sex. It depressed me for a while but surprisingly I bounced back a lot sooner than my wife and I thought I would and moved on. But soon after, some depression drifted over me about my wife's happiness and needs. I felt that I had let her down horribly and was so ashamed that I could no longer make love to her. She thought the opposite. She loved me for who I was and continuously told me she didn't care about sex as much as she loved me being in her life. I know, a keeper. 

I spent the next three years trying to please my wife in the non-traditional ways in bed and she liked it but a part of me had enough of it and made me realize I was depriving my wife of real passionate sex because of my own fault (injury was an accident but because of me). I had a talk with her one night about her finding a lover. She argued with me and said she didnt need one and I kept insisting. Two days later, I finally convinced her and she agreed. I told her that our daughter would be going away to college now and we'd have more time to ourselves.  She agreed eventually settled on one of her co-workers that she was physically and intellectually attracted to. She explained our situation and he was ok with it. 

For 2 years now, long story short, my wife and her lover have been sleeping together about once or twice a week. She loves him as a passionate lover and protector and me as her best friend and soul-mate. In that regard, I guess she is poly at least? Now our problem. My awesome niece who graduated from college has moved in with us while she fulfills an internship for work in our city. My sister asked if she could stay with us to save money and we couldn't say no because of how great of a girl she is.

My wife's lover (Mitch) lives about 25 minutes away from us and my wife had decided, with my permission, to have him over at our home every time because she's more comfortable with it. Normally, my wife and I  sleep together in the same bed in our bedroom but whenever Mitch is over, I'll take the guest room and they will have the bedroom. With my niece staying with us, we decided that she would get the guest room and whenever Mitch would come over (a little close to my niece's bedtime), I would take the couch while Mitch and my wife did their thing in the room. And to avoid my niece finding out, unlike normal occurrences, Mitch would then leave after they were done and I would get back to our room.

This had worked for 2 months until two nights ago. My niece had woken up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and Mitch, unfortunately, had taken too long in getting back into our room after a piss break. So as a result, my niece from the corner of the guest room doorway saw Mitch fully naked and erect walking back into our room where she saw my wife fully naked lying on a stack of pillows on the bed with her legs in the air. Sorry for the details, just wanted to show you that there pretty much wasn't any room for us to lie out of what she thought was going on. 

She was very shocked and upset but decided to go back to bed and confront my wife in the morning. The next morning, she tells my wife what she saw and threatened her that she would tell me what she was doing if she didn't confess to me. My wife pretended to beg her not to tell me because she didn't want to tell her the truth about our situation. She didn't know how I'd feel about that. To be honest, I wouldn't be too comfortable and my wife are still thinking about what we're going to say to her. She has gone to Reno with her friends and will return Tuesday and has told my wife that she expects her to tell the truth by the time she gets back. 

My question is what do I do in this situation? I would prefer her not to find out the truth but I would not want her to think that my wife is a cheating whore either. If I tell her the truth, how do I explain it to her without making me sound like a ""coward"" and that I'm doing this for my love for my wife. My niece thinks the world of me and I wouldn't want her to think little of me. Our daughter knows about my wife and Mitch after my wife sat her down one night and explained what was going on but out of respect for me, she has never fully brought it to my attention that she knows and does not know that I know she knows (hope that makes sense). Other than my daughter, my wife's sister and best friend also know. But, I know telling my niece about the situation won't be as easy as telling those three. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation with family? How did you respond? Thanks.

TL;DR - Wife and her lover were caught by my niece having sex. Niece thinks aunt is cheating and doesn't know I know about her lover. How do we explain the situation?"
101ssq,1,2012-09-17,My boyfriend [20m] seems to have chosen his Fraternity over me [22F] ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/101ssq/my_boyfriend_20m_seems_to_have_chosen_his/,"We're going on 3 years dating, and it was amazing for the first 2 years. Recently there has been a lot more strain, partly because we were long distance for a while, and partly because he has been spending increasing time at his fraternity and less time hanging out with me. We usually see each other at least every other day, but he usually only wants to hang out if it's at the fraternity house.

As a 22 year old girl, I've already graduated college and work 5 full days a week. He is doing an internship and can pretty much choose his own hours, so he gets upset that I don't want to party every night. He stays up until 2 or 3 am every night, and only hangs out at his frat house. I can't convince him to go out with my friends and me, and he will rarely go to bars or apartment parties. I don't like being at the frat because I'm the oldest girl there by 3 years, and I just think it's really immature. 

I still love him a lot, but it's been ages since he's asked me to hang out in a situation that wasn't at the frat house. I try to take him places and sometimes he'll agree, but he's almost never at my apartment and the only nights we spend together at at the fraternity. He assures me that this is only because classes haven't started yet (our school starts very late) and he is making the most of summer. It's putting a huge strain on me, though, because all of my friends go out on romantic dates and I'm just stuck drinking cheap beer with underage kids in a frat house. 

He's never cheated on me, but lots of girls text him constantly and they're all over him when I'm at the frat. They know me as ""Mrs. *his name*"" so I know nothing fishy is going on, but it's still a little weird to me that he has so many girl friends.

tl;dr I'm worried that my boyfriend is more into his frat than he is into me, and I'm not sure what to do about it. "
101rzv,1,2012-09-17,Can anybody help me keep my gap year from feeling like a trapped year?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/101rzv/can_anybody_help_me_keep_my_gap_year_from_feeling/,"This is gonna be long, but I'm really in need of advice.

I'm 18 and recently graduated. Rather than going on to college, I ended up taking a gap year. This was mainly because my parents were going through a divorce right around the time I should have been applying for college and scholarships, and that along with certain other consequent events hit me harder than I could have anticipated. By the time I was able to focus on moving my own life forward again, I had missed my chance for any kind of full ride scholarship and a lot of other financial aid. I scored the highest on the ACT out of my graduating class and had a  very good GPA, and I didn't want to be reliant on student loans to get to college. So I decided to take this year off and apply next year when I could hopefully take advantage of scholarships.

I wanted to find better ways to spend my year off than sitting around at home and working a minimum wage job. I wanted to use this time to explore my interests and decide for sure what I want to major in (I have a pretty good idea that I want to go into biochemistry or biotechnology or neuroscience). I also wanted to get a good job and start saving money, and to just start doing more things that I enjoy, which meant traveling a bit. I know how it sounds to say this, but there isn't much here at all in the small town where I grew up. One of my main goals was to find a research internship or volunteer lab position, but I haven't found anything that isn't aimed at undergraduate students or higher. I really have no one I know that can help. I have no mentor here, no one in my family and no one that I know, who has done anything remotely like this. The mindset here is to stay local, find any job or find a trade. 

My plan as it stands right now is to find professors and researchers who are working on things that I would be interested in, and email several of them to see if any would consider allowing me an internship or volunteer position. The research of Dr. Miguel Nicolelis at Duke on brain-computer interfacing is particularly interesting. He is at the top of my list. Anyway, if anyone would offer me an opportunity I would need to move to the area, which would mean finding out what the place was like, finding a job and apartment or other housing there, saving enough money to move... And then to apply to university with plenty of time to spare next year, since I'm not currently enrolled anywhere. 

So to be concise, I guess my questions are:
How do I find an internship or... travel... or something that would make this gap year worth while? How likely is my current 'plan' to work?
How do I find out about a city before I move, if I don't have very much money to visit it? 
How do I find a job and housing in a new city?

Any general advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated, and my plan is not set in stone. I would also be interested in hearing from anyone who maybe took a similar route. And maybe some forums that I could post this question on would be helpful, too.

Thanks for the read"
101rxz,4,2012-09-17,My boyfriend [20M] and I [20F] were long distance this summer and I made some stupid decisions involving another guy - how should I deal with this?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/101rxz/my_boyfriend_20m_and_i_20f_were_long_distance/,"Let me preface this by saying that I can be extremely naïve and I trust people more than I probably should. I am also exceptionally verbose.

I [20F] have been with my boyfriend [20M] for almost two years. He is beyond wonderful and we love each other very much. We spent this past summer on opposite sides of the country (US) due to our respective internships. 

I met someone at my workplace this summer, we’ll call him John [25M], who I hit it off with right away. And when I say hit it off, I just mean that it was easy for us to talk and we became friends. Eventually John asked if I wanted to hang out outside of work. He had been getting a little flirtier and, upon some reflection, some of the things I said could have been taken as flirty as well. That night I went home and called my boyfriend and told him about John asking to hang out. My boyfriend said he was fine with it as long as I promised to be careful.

The next night John and I ended up at the beach after work. We swam for a long time and then sat on the beach talking until it got dark. I was planning to head home but John asked if I wanted to grab dinner first. I saw no harm in it since all we had done was talk and agreed. We had a great conversation at dinner but at the end he asked if I wanted to go back to his place. I was taken aback but managed to get out that no, it was time for me to head home. I told my boyfriend about the whole evening and he said that John saw all of it as a date and that he was trying to get me into bed. Understandable conclusion.

I went to the beach by myself the next night and got a text from John asking where I was. I told him the same spot and a little while later he showed up with two friends (a guy and a girl) who were staying with him. They brought alcohol and offered me some but I said no. Note that it was about a half hour drive back to my place. I hit it off with his friends and they ended up asking if I wanted to head back to John’s place. We were having a lot of fun so I went.
When we got there, they convinced me to drink and around midnight/one everyone was getting sleepy. By this point I was a relatively drunk and knew I couldn’t drive home that night so I had to stay at John’s. His friends had already taken up the couch and blow-up mattress so I offered to sleep on the floor. John said he had somewhere else and led me upstairs. Thinking there was a guest room, I followed. He took me to his room, pointed to his bed and said I could have half. Here’s where I’m completely at fault.
I told John I’d be fine with the floor but he said “No, c’mon this is easier.” Naïve me said okay. I climbed into bed staying as far to one side as I could, thinking I’d actually get half the bed. He climbed in after me but got really close to me so we were on the same side. After a minute he said “You’re really timid aren’t you?” At this point I was drunk and sleepy and didn’t bother making sense of that. Then he slid his hands up my skirt and started groping me. I kept saying no but I’m pretty sure it came out a pretty weak, sleepy, “noooooo” instead of “NO!” He stopped but ended up trying again a couple more times. He ultimately got the message and didn’t touch me again. The next morning we both got up and I said thanks for letting me stay over and then left.

My boyfriend had called multiple times the night before and left me a bunch of texts. I felt awful. He assumed I’d gone to bed early and was asleep. I called him, planning to tell him everything but he was so worried and upset that I’d put myself in that situation that I couldn’t bring myself to tell him the worst part. He knows everything up to me being in the same bed with John but I couldn’t bear to tell him that over the phone. 

My boyfriend and I finally got to see one another yesterday for the first time in three months and we had a beautiful day together. I had been planning to tell him the rest of what happened that night but couldn’t get it out. I’ve been sick about this since it happened a month ago and I don’t know what to do. John and I stayed friends at work but we’re not keeping in touch or anything now that my internship is over. I wasn’t upset with John because, to be fair, he didn’t know I had a boyfriend. I’m, again, at massive fault for never telling him. It just never came up naturally though that’s a horrible excuse. I should have told John I was in a relationship. 

I’ve told a couple people really close to me what happened and all of them have said not to tell my boyfriend because it would just make things complicated. I feel like I cheated even though I never kissed John or responded to his advances, but my friends said that I didn’t cheat. I’m not sure what to do. Should I tell him? I see him again tomorrow but I don’t know if I should bring it up. At one point this summer he told me not to tell him anything that happened between me and other guys (he was jealous that I spent a long time on the phone with one of my best friends, who is a guy), but this is different.

I’m so sorry for the bloody novel I’ve written you and I applaud all of you who made it through. Actually, I applaud anyone who made it past the first couple sentences. Any advice would be very much appreciated. And I won’t be offended if you just came here to tell me I’m an idiot. I truly deserve it.

TL;DR  My boyfriend and I spent the summer on opposite sides of the country because of our internships. I hung out with a guy I worked with and ultimately got drunk at his house and spent the night in the same bed (though I didn’t let anything happen). Should I tell my boyfriend?

101rg7,8,2012-09-17,Changing employment practices in nursing - from traditional employment to unpaid internships?,[deleted],nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/101rg7/changing_employment_practices_in_nursing_from/,"I work at a hospital that is affiliated with a nursing school. Each year, the hospital hires a few grads from the school who demonstrate excellence, along with existing (non-RN) hospital employees who attend the school and graduate. This year, the hospital is only hiring the few graduates who already worked for the facility in another capacity, and taking on some other new grads from the school as ""unpaid interns"" for a 1.5 year time frame. We have a union, and I'm surprised the union didn't come out against this. New RNs who passed NCLEX  and graduated in 2011 or prior got real jobs with pay, benefits, seniority, etc., and this year's grads are unpaid interns?? Would you want to work with another RN who does your same job but doesn't get paid for it? If you were a patient would you want to be cared for by an RN who isn't paid? I don't know what to say about this, other than that it seems to devalue the labor of all nurses, not just the unpaid ones."
101qa8,10,2012-09-17,My thoughts on the industry (reporter since 2007),lsmucker,RealJournalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealJournalism/comments/101qa8/my_thoughts_on_the_industry_reporter_since_2007/,"When I started reporting, it really wasn't my first idea. Prior to writing in college, I had started out as a mass communication major, a film major and then an audio major before my parents, in an effort to get me to graduate, told me I had only two more years to graduate. My junior year, I was on staff for the Columbia Chronical, Columbia College Chicago's school newspaper. 

After graduating, I sent out my resume all over the US in hopes of getting a position and finally received an offer as a paid internship at a small daily in Amsterdam, NY. They offered me $12 an hour and I basically got fill out my own time card and was paid for mileage. It was a good job, but I realized after a while the nothing my teachers taught me really applied to the position. They didn't teach me about covering board meetings. I never really learned how to use a camera and I never realized how my stories would be chopped and up and rearranged by the editor without my consent. 

After about a year, my job was cut and I was left with a decision of whether to stay in New York and work a low paying job or look once more for a job. I found a promising position at another small newspaper in Sutton Nebraska. I went expediting a young staff and a great paper and found a place where people were trying to get out as soon as possible. I found out why after many empty promises to pay me for milage and a paycheck that bounced. From there, I was just about ready to give up. I moved back home in effort to get my life back together and eventually found a position at a newspaper in Clinton, IL. The manager was great, the pay was generous and I was covering sports. He eventually left the paper during my first year and I was promoted to managing editor only to have it snatched away from me and my sports position eliminated by a scumbag publisher. I then moved out to Pontiac, IL where I have been working for a year and a few months. Already, there are talks about positions getting cut. 

So, what you can take out of this is what you want. I am not a bad worker, I always worked what I was given and was willing to learn. I think what I have learned is that print journalism is more of a lifestyle and less of a job. You have to be able to work hours outside of the 9-5 schedule. You have to be willing to go above and beyond the call of duty. You have to be willing to stick with it, no matter what the outcome. You have to be able to learn and absolutely have no fear of talking to people. 

There is good stuff too. I can't even tell you how many times people have thanked me for what I wrote. How many people have told me they got calls from friends they hadn't heard from in years. How many people I have talked with about serious loss or about serious hope with me. How many people I have inspired and that's only the ones who have contacted me. 

The love this job is to love constant change. To be able to take the good with the bad and to be happy and upbeat through it all. :-) 

I wish for each of you to have at least one good editor who pushes you to do better and who believes in you. I love this job and can't imagine doing anything else. Even after all that. "

My MA is in International Science and Technology Policy (but I have interests in other areas as well).

I think my JD signifies that I can bring very useful skills the table even if a position is not strictly law-related; it required me to be self-motivated and organized, a creative thinker, thorough and analytical, and a strong writer and researcher.  I have done some internships and post-grad fellowships, have helped to supervise support staff and interns, and have strong references.  I have a lot of interest in intellectual property, privacy

More Info:  My experience so far is mostly in public service; most recently one in indigent legal defense, another working on issues of IP law and policy mostly in an access to essential medicines context.  This is why I feel work on government, or supporting/contracting with government, as well as in the public policy sectors could be a good fit.  As my MA suggests, I have a lot of interest in doing writing or analysis in areas related to science or technology, such as intellectual property, privacy, cyber-security and other internet policy issues, and energy/environment.

I’m currently finishing my undergraduate art history degree in Paris and I’m thinking of doing my master degree in America or Canada (starting Fall 2013). The problem is, it is very difficult to appreciate the quality of each university via their websites only and I don’t know any American who is studying this subject over here. I would say my English level is pretty good (I’ve been attending summer schools in England) and I’ll be passing the TOEFL test next month. My area of study is modern and contemporary art, especially 20th century prints, but I’m not against getting into curatorship or museum studies in general. 

Could you tell me which universities have not only good reputation but also interesting internship programs? Thank you very much! (and please excuse me if there's any grammatical error)

100y0s,0,2012-09-17,Need Reddit's feedback on my startup's website [x-post from startups],[deleted],web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/100y0s/need_reddits_feedback_on_my_startups_website/,"Hello Reddit,

My startup called [Interngration](http://yolo.vacau.com/index.php) is set to have a soft launch next week. Reddit has been tremendous in helping me along my web development phase and I'm counting on you guys to give me feedback before we go live.

(*The link you are seeing is for our test server. Note that we do have the domain name interngration.com*)

**What is Interngration?**

Interngration is a free intern and co-op community that offers everyone an inside look at internships within companies. All our content is submitted by the interns and co-ops – salaries, job scope reviews,interview questions, and more.

Post-secondary students now have a new way to browse job listings and get instant, in-depth details for any internship or co-op opening. We can get you in touch with a student who's completed his/her internship or co-op in the same position you are applying for within minutes!

**Feedback Needed**

* What do you guys think about the layout/design? I am a novice web programmer and am learning as I go.

* We are counting on users to come to our site and register themselves and post a review with us. Is this model flawed? How can we give an incentive for students who've completed their internship/co-op to come to Interngration.com and post a review?

* The number of job reviews we have is very limited. Probably about 50 reviews between 5 companies. So our database of reviews and site content is currently very limited. **So, is it even a good idea to have a soft launch right now?** Or, should we stay offline and try and collect more reviews first and build up our database before we launch?

 My team and I are very confused and conflicted about this point. I feel that we should have a soft launch now so that students in my university will know that we exist and users will slowly start trickling in and our database will grow slowly. My co-founder thinks otherwise. He feels that we should hold off the launch and build up our content and database first. He feels that users who go to the site now will be put off by the lack of content and never come back.

So, good people of reddit, here I am seeking your advise again. Please feel free to criticize the hell out of me/my idea/my website. I'm going to go grab my flak jacket. Thank you and looking forward to your replies.

PS: I know glassdoor.com exists but what we are doing is rather different. "

I was diagnosed with Tourette's when I was about 8 or 9. I'm 20 now. I'm pretty sure I have ADHD. I've always had trouble focusing and remembering things, I'm pretty much constantly in motion. I have to make a conscious effort to stay still. Anyway, I've had these symptoms pretty much my whole life, but I never really thought about it too much. After losing my financial aide at school, I realized I need to do something about it.
I've only been smoking about 2 years, the first year of which I probably smoked less than 10 times. This year I pretty much smoke everyday. It's the only way I can get a good night's sleep and have even a little focus on anything. Anyway I recently switched doctors and during the initial interview I said that I have smoked before. I said that I started 2 years ago and smoked very little last year, and a little more this year. It was an intern or something filling out a paper and she didn't seem to care much, but I don't know how my doctor would react. My doctor referred me to a neurologist and I was wondering if I should tell her that I smoke. I'm really worried that it will affect my diagnosis even though I've had these symptoms my whole life and started smoking recently. I could really use some help"

* When I was 15, in 9th grade, I went through an Emo Angst phase and grew out my hair (it had always been cropped short). Lame. And it got me pulling from the top of my head, I don't know why or how it started.

* Grew out of the emo phase by the start of 10th grade, but I kept pulling my hair a bit. It's a long time ago, so I forget.

* Eventually, I transitioned to eyelashes. For the remainder of high school, my notebooks would be full of them when you'd flip through the pages.

* Then, I went to the pubic hair. After some close calls getting caught with my hands down my pants, I stopped. 

* University started, and that's when the eyebrows got bad. When studying, reading, etc, it's just such a natural position to rest my right arm close to my right eyebrow, and pluck. It's not too bad, though, some of my friends see me do it and mention it but I don't do it hardcore, so my eyebrows aren't that thin.

* 3rd year university, HUGELY stressful exam, it gets bad. Studying for almost a day straight, the lateral half of my right eyebrow was just a few hairs. It was bad enough for people to notice. My brother's friends asked me: ""Dude, wtf is up with your eyebrow?"" and that was embarassing.

* 4th year university, I had internships and a research thesis - very, very little stress and barely didn't pull, but I still get the urge when I'm reading and my hand defaults to that position.

* Grad school, today, I'm not that bad. I really, really try to keep my hands busy and my girlfriend always reminds me when I'm doing it, but my eyebrows are still much thinner than I'd like them to be. Often, when I'm alone and can't control it, I ""pet"" my eyebrows, rubbing the hairs, and really try to resist pulling. I often end up with a lot less pulled hairs than before.

**So, /r/Trichsters:**

* Do the eyebrows grow back, in your experience? Will 100% of the hairs grow back or did I likely kill a few roots and my eyebrows will be thinner than normal forever?

* Does stress commonly affect pulling?"

2) What is the contract situation like? Their current contract is set to expire in October, from what they have said on-air. At this point, it seems fairly obvious that they are going to renew, am I correct?

3) If they were NOT to renew, would the trio continue working together? And would it be in Anthony's Compound?

4) Is there any interaction between O&amp;A and HooHoo behind the scenes? The tension seems to have subsided a bit over the last couple years but there are still a few jabs every now and then (mainly from Opie).

5) How much of the tension with Management is real and how much is just for the show?

Long time fan, these are just some of the things I've always wondered.

I have been thinking about this for a few months now and have come here for advice. My gf and I have been dating for roughly 5 years. For the past year, senior year of high school, she was living with me and my family because she was kicked out. She really have no communication with her mother or father, but has a great relationship with her grandma. I always thought living with her would be amazing and we would have the greatest time. Man, does living with someone show who they are. It's not that anything big was a red flag but the littlest things would really bug me. Like not picking up dropped stuff in the shower(soap, razor, etc) to leaving her stuff all of my desk.

Anyway, this last summer I did a program to help me transition to college life, took a few classes, did an internship at the largest oil producing company in my home state, etc. During those 2 months I had the chance to meet some really great people, non of which are dating material. Regardless It still opened my eyes to the people out there. I have been dating the same girl since 8th grade, I haven't seen what else is out there. Did i mention that she is my first girlfriend. This summer program made me realize that we really don't enjoy many of the same things. I mean sure, we may like a couple things but she doesn't enjoy the thing I live for. I Live to ride a snowmachine(snowmobile for you southern folk). She never wants to go and she hates the snow, while i love it.

I was able to drive home 50 miles to see my family. When I would get there she wouldn't say hi, she would expect me to. When I felt it appropriate for her to welcome me I wouldn't say anything to her. She would then proceed to go back to her room and pout about it. I find it annoying as hell, she expects me to initiate everything, and pouts if I don't. It got to the point that I didn't want to talk to her, it was always because she was upset. On some of the longer weekends we would get through that and all we would do is have sex. We would never go out, or hang out with her friends, or mine. I'm not to fond of her friends. Also, I feel like she has being like dependent on my family. Like she doesn't have a life outside of me and that makes it hard on my.

I've finally grown to the age where sex isn't everything. I don't want a relationship where all that holds us together is sex and I feel that is what I have. I feel that it will never be the same even if we tried to ""restart."" Restarting wouldn't change her perspective on riding a sled. I feel obligated to stay home and not go to my buddys house.

As big of a douche bag as I would have been I was going to break it off while she was down in college. This is where it gets tricky. My family has invested so much into her, shes really dependent on them. Shes the way that she got to college, the reason shes in the one she is. My sister drives over from her school on long weekend and takes her around the states. I feel as if I would be dropping her on the street if I were to break it off. Actually I feel like my mom would be disappointed in me. I feel like I should talk to my mom but I am actually scared to. It doesn't help that my gf is down in a college where shes got nobody but her roommates whom she just met.

I'm really in need of some advice here. Would I be an asshole if I broke up with her while shes down in college with nobody?

tl;dr Gf of 5 years is going to college in a different state. My family is invested in her and is the only thing she has. We don't have much in common, my eyes opened to life outside of high school.

I can expect people to be asking each other how their summers went and stuff.

I am anxious as to how to respond. I couldn't find an internship or work, like most people at my school do.

What's more is that I took time off last school year. If I bring that up in conversations I know people will ask what I did.

I took time off because I was really stressed out and needed some time off. I squirm at the thought of saying I basically was at home and just researching cool computer science related things the entire time. It certainly was a very transformative time for me, but it's just so hard to have a conversation like that when people are expecting more simple mainstream things like ""I had an internship at company XYZ.""

I want to just say that I was at home enjoying my summer and working on some software projects/learning on my own. But I am anxious to say that because I don't want someone's first impression of me to be a lazy person.

So how do you guys deal with relating to someone how you spent an extended period of time doing something that's not mainstream, and is hard to talk about without getting embarrassed?"
100i5z,1,2012-09-17,If only the past could be changed and not be a waste,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/100i5z/if_only_the_past_could_be_changed_and_not_be_a/,"I feel like I failed.  I got a useless undergrad degree and then got a useless graduate degree with no future in the places I want to work in the most.  I have tried and tried to get good jobs, but it has failed too many times.  yes, I know people are dealing with unemployment, but this almost feels worse.

I originally thought I wanted to study medicine in college, but found out I wasn't cut out for it soon after taking the undergrad courses.  I was lost then and went into a major that didn't completely lose all the class credits I took.  I also was in a long distance relationship that probably should not have happened as it shifted things for me a bit too.  Studying an interdisciplinary major for the environment was a bad idea.  Later, I went into a masters program in urban planning.  A year after I was in there, at least I ended the relationship that was a mistake outside of the lessons learned.  I found out I was bipolar during this time.  Overall, now I see I should have gone into something better and applied myself.

My current boyfriend is in medical school after growing up in extreme poverty.  He was motivated to change his life after finding out a life in bad choices and poverty was not a way to live.  He enrolled in community college, worked full time, and went out of his way for perfection.  He studied all night after only two hours of sleep each night to get perfect grades.  He eventually got a fantastic degree and used it to get to medical school, where he is almost finished and doing fantastically there.  He is a top candidate for what he wants to specialize in.  The point of all this is, I feel like a useless asshole after looking at him.  I love him, but his success is a reminder of what I am not.

I now am working in a job that is with people who only got about a high school education at the state in a place that has no future and is not in my field.  I got it after over a year of unemployment which was depressing already on its own.  My co-workers resent my being there even though they have no idea how much I am a loser from my choices in the past.  I cannot get into the EPA or any place that I want to work because I chose useless fields and obviously therefore did not apply myself.  It feels like I lack the intelligence and drive to get anywhere.  I feel no passion enough to get up and get going into something.

I cannot feel anything but useless.  After seeing my boyfriend and what he has done.  I love him so much, but it hurts to see how hard he works while I was so lazy.  I wanted to try and fix things to help my career by talking to the person who was over my internship who now lives in another state with a great job.  They recommended getting an International Code Council zoning inspector certification.  I had hope then and bought the books to study for the test.  Now I cannot focus on studying them because it just feels dead.  The only thing that was good out of my past was that somehow things led me to adopt my dog and meet my boyfriend who I have been with for three years who is the love of my life.  My family, friends, and boyfriend know how awful I feel and keep telling me it will get better but I disagree.  I am 27 now and have too much student debt to go to school and start over as well as just am too old.  

The only things that hold me back from trying to die are that I don't want my dog to be alone, my debts I don't want someone else to pay after death, and my boyfriend not having someone to help feed him and finally the knowledge that if I mess up, I will probably have brain damage which is the only thing worse than my current circumstances. I just feel so useless and down with no future in my career.  I keep trying to tell myself that people have survived worse things, but it still doesn't seem to change how I feel.  

I want to call the person who counseled me in the past but I don't want to bother them since they are dealing with their own major health issues.   Plus, what will it honestly do?

I feel so lost and hopeless in my purpose in life.  I don't want to live through another person or in their shadow.  I want to be my own success but it feels so hopeless.  Is this going to be the rest of my life?  If so, then I just feel that once my debts are paid, it may be time to finish my brief existence.  I know ending one's own life is considered shameful, but what else is there when you pine the past that should have been different."
100g9b,60,2012-09-17,[FR]iend showed [ME] something in his attic.,xiggolthorp,Thetruthishere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/100g9b/friend_showed_me_something_in_his_attic/,"Just found this subreddit and love the concept, I have a few encounters that I had considered sharing with nosleep but never did because I want to share them with 
people who might believe me. This particular post will involve my best friend Jeff, I will let him read over everything before posting these encounters just to make 
sure he is comfortable with the content. This isn't the first time I've encountered strange, unexplainable things in my life and I plan to post more on that at a 
later time.

The most interesting paranormal event concerning Jeff occured during the summer of 2011 while I was out of town. The majority of this even I heard about from Jeff and
had I not participated in two crucial parts I would not believe him. During that summer I was at an internship 1,000 miles away but since we were good friends we talked
on the phone quite often. He started telling me about hearing strange noises in his crawlspace above his garage, (he sat in the garage while on the phone and they keep
their refrigerator in there.) After weeks of hearing these noises he took it upon himself to climb up there and see what sort of animal had made said noises. He was on
the phone with me while he climbed up there. He told me at first that he didn't see anything, he then told me he saw something moving in the corner, then all I heard
was a shout, a crash, and a lot of cursing. Jeff told me he fell out of the crawlspace because something up there ran at him. He said it was too big and sounded more
curious than scared. 

This is his description of what he saw ""It was not quite human and not quite animal in shaped. This thing crawled on all fours like a human but was way too fast. It
was on the smaller side. Only about four feet tall if it were to stand up.""

I thought at first that he was pulling my leg but he kept assuring me that he was telling me the truth, he suddenly said that he thought he wanted to get out of the
garage for a bit and would call back the following evening. During the following weeks Jeff's past time of our conversations was sitting in the garage and staring up at
the crawlspace trying to get a reaction out of whatever was up there. He told me that it was still scratching around occassionally and made some strange gutteral noise
that sounded somewhere between a goat and a cow. He did eventually climb back up there but didn't see the thing though he did find some evidence of something being up
there. This is his description of what he found "" I found where something had been moving some things like boxes and insulation. Slightly into the crawspace I found a 
burnt old scrap of paper with a symbol on it. I had never seen the symbol before and the paper would later disappear without a trace. For along time before and after a wierd sulfer
smell would be coming from there. I checked there was no gas leak and nothing I could connect it to. It seem to just be in the same spot I found the paper.""

He also told me he would hear what sounded like something scratching inside the walls. He heard these noises when sitting in the living room which shared a wall
with the garage and went on to say that he heard the scratching come from the connecting wall. A couple months after this all started up, it stopped completely and has
not reoccurred since.

I only had two personal encounters with this thing, one of which was over the phone. One night as we were on the phone he told me it was making that noise again. This
night he was in his room but could hear it from the garage. So while we were on the phone he walked into the garage, put the phone on speaker, and stood under the crawl
space. I know Jeff did not make this noise because he was in mid-sentence when it cried out. He did it justice by saying it sounded like a combination of a goat and a
cow and something about the noise made my skin crawl even though it was over the phone. The other encounter occured while I was visiting home in the middle of my
internship, I was over at Jeff's and as we were watching a movie in the living room late at night we heard the scratching coming from the garage. I was terrified but
Jeff and I went in there to see what it was. Jeff was about to climb up when I grabbed a broom handle and pushed up against the panel of the crawl space. I pushed it up
2 or 3 inches before I felt pressure on the other side slam it down. Jeff tested the panel himself and couldn't budge it. We left it alone for the rest of the night.

We don't know what it was or what made it go away or what even made it appear in the first place. I understand that the way I presented this might be a bit dry but I just
wanted to state the bare facts without any embellishment. Jeff and I will answer any questions you have and I will tell you more of my experiences with and without Jeff
if this goes well."

My ideal job is working as a research assistant for a think tank that deals in foreign policy, especially peace, security, and conflict analysis. The problem with this is that there are very few of those jobs and the competition is beyond fierce. I had an internship at a foreign policy think tank and almost every single one of my co-interns was a masters candidate or had a masters degree, and this was for an unpaid internship.

I've applied to every job opening and internship that I could and have been networking with pretty much anyone I can think of but I think I need to have a backup plan because as of right now, this is all I planned on doing for the next two years before going back to school.

The parts of the job that appeal to me the most are the research, the strategic thinking and the process of focusing in and completely mastering a subject. I am trying to figure out other positions in other fields that might give me a similar amount of satisfaction, but besides looking at think tanks focused on subjects besides foreign policy, I don't really know where to begin.

TLDR I need help coming up with ideas for jobs/careers that possess similar characteristics to my ideal job of working as a research assistant in a foreign policy think tank because I don't really know where to begin."
100fhx,1,2012-09-17,Need Reddit's feedback on my startup's website.,5hredder,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/100fhx/need_reddits_feedback_on_my_startups_website/,"Hello Reddit,

My startup called [Interngration](http://yolo.vacau.com/index.php) is set to have a soft launch next week. Reddit has been tremendous in helping me along my web development phase and I'm counting on you guys to give me feedback before we go live.

(*The link you are seeing is for our test server. Note that we do have the domain name interngration.com*)

**What is Interngration?**

Interngration is a free intern and co-op community that offers everyone an inside look at internships within companies. All our content is submitted by the interns and co-ops – salaries, job scope reviews,interview questions, and more.

Post-secondary students now have a new way to browse job listings and get instant, in-depth details for any internship or co-op opening. We can get you in touch with a student who's completed his/her internship or co-op in the same position you are applying for within minutes!

**Feedback Needed**

* What do you guys think about the layout/design? I am a novice web programmer and am learning as I go.

* We are counting on users to come to our site and register themselves and post a review with us. Is this model flawed? How can we give an incentive for students who've completed their internship/co-op to come to Interngration.com and post a review?

* The number of job reviews we have is very limited. Probably about 50 reviews between 5 companies. So our database of reviews and site content is currently very limited. **So, is it even a good idea to have a soft launch right now?** Or, should we stay offline and try and collect more reviews first and build up our database before we launch?

 My team and I are very confused and conflicted about this point. I feel that we should have a soft launch now so that students in my university will know that we exist and users will slowly start trickling in and our database will grow slowly. My co-founder thinks otherwise. He feels that we should hold off the launch and build up our content and database first. He feels that users who go to the site now will be put off by the lack of content and never come back.

So, good people of reddit, here I am seeking your advise again. Please feel free to criticize the hell out of me/my idea/my website. I'm going to go grab my flak jacket. Thank you and looking forward to your replies.

PS: I know glassdoor.com exists but what we are doing is rather different. "

   When I was a teenager trying to work during the summer- it was so hard for me to find a summer job. However my sister- who is a couple years younger never had too much difficulty. I would always end up working somewhere shitty like subway while she got to work at the mall or as a waitress at a local restaurant. 

One summer a new frozen yogurt place opened up near my house- and we both filled out applications. I was actually called back for an interview- but when I got there the owner was surprised to see that it was me. He asked me ""where is your sister?"". Apparently he got our names confused, and wanted to hire her instead of me. This was few years ago now, but I think I remember him saying something along the lines that- they were really looking for ""pretty young girls"" to work at the place because the business was new. 

Well I mean from a business perspective I guess this makes sense- I would guess that hiring attractive young female workers might bring in more business. However, how is this not sex-based hiring discrimination? There are so many places that obviously do this- like so many of the stores in the mall- why don't they get called out on this? 

Now that I am working on my engineering degree- I think I am going through something simmilar again. One of my girl friends in my major got this really good internship with Nav-Air this past summer. We both applied to this- and we have very similar GPAs and everything. However she was the only one out of the 50 (of which there are only 5 females) in my major and my year that got this. I'd hate to say it- but I really think it had to do a lot to do with her being a woman. Ok so I understand that engineering is a mainly a male dominated field- and employers try to attract more females. But still- it somehow feels unfair to me."

1003ue,0,2012-09-16,Help needed with potential long distance(TL;DR/Very Long),[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1003ue/help_needed_with_potential_long_distancetldrvery/,"I am 19 year old male.

This is a general overview with some key specifics to give you a general idea of the situation.

Just a quick disclaimer. This is a very long story and I think some of the details are important. If you stick with it and finish it, thank you. If not, I understand.

Last summer I went to another state with my family to aid with a domestic disaster relief effort. We stayed with another family for a week or so, and they were very hospitable. We are both of the Muslim faith, and similar in our degree of practice. They had a daughter, who is 1 year older than me, who I thought was very beautiful from the first moment I saw her. However, we did not get to talk much as we were mostly in a parentally supervised environment. Before I left I was able to get to be friends with her on Facebook. At this point, my feelings for her were just a crush, and I realized that.

Back in my home state, I decided to message her and thank her for her families' hospitality. We ended up talking over fb message, ironically, for about a month. At that point I cut it off and became absorbed in a new semester at my university. Roughly a middle of the way through, she messages me and we begin to talk again. This time, however, I am caught up in other girl issues and am just talking to her normally as if I would any girl.

As it turns out, the side girl issues fade. But as her and my mom kept in close touch, they invite me back to their home(by myself) for an internship opportunity in their area. So I go their at the beginning of the next year for two weeks.

The first week, nothing happens. Then starting the next week, as the situation would have it, we end up hanging out with each other until the early morning hours watching movies, talking, etc. Each night it seems things get a bit more physical between her and I(I would say she initiated it mostly). I'm talking serious physical, like wrestling and other things, not dinky stuff. The last night before I leave, things get a bit heated and we make out. This is a crucial detail. As a Muslim(not going to debate about whether it was right or wrong) with a more or less traditional mindset and with not too much exposure to women, for me this seems to be a big thing. For her, she had previously been in a relationship for 2 years. However as Muslims we cannot engage in premarital sexual activities, so I don't know how far they got. I talked to her about afterwards, as there would be a large distance between us(multiple states) and we eventually we ""decide"" to keep in touch over facebook so our rents don't find out and banish us to Siberia.

Mistake #1 --&gt; I should've talked to her about whether or not we were, I suppose, ""together"" or not and expressed what I wanted. However, I didn't and that's what we came up with. fail

I come back and I am completely at a loss as to the status quo. Whether or not we are together, etc as we failed to work that out. As the days go by, she texts me and we talk. However, I never am the aggressor and I do not call her or hit her up as much as she did to me. The texting and calling seems to slow down. Whether she was busy with school or anything else, I have no way of knowing for sure. I talk to my dad (and friends) and tell him everything. He tells me that I should tell her that we can be friends and see where it takes us, as we can't do anything right now(b/c distance &amp; life goals). Some of my friends say similar things.

Mistake #2 --&gt; should've shown more interest(call, etc)

Valentines day comes along, and I send her flowers with a nice message and some chocolate(most I can do working with the distance). However, that same night I talk to her. I say that I don't know what to do about the distance and about us. She agrees and says shes not ""looking"" for anything right now. However, there is no distinct cut off. No one says that we are not going to talk to each other anymore. I apologize for making out with her the last night b/c of our Islamic restrictions. She says we both share the blame. My feeling for her are the same though.

Mistake 3 --&gt; Shouldn't have shown uncertainty/followed everyone else's advice

It is interesting to note that when I was with her in person, I was confident, in character, etc. When I came back, I found it hard to display those same things through text or phone call. I'm better in physical interpersonal relations.

Still feeling the same way I text her, and get more and more pressed, as I realize that she is not exactly showing the same amount of interest as she was earlier. I'd say I text her every 2-3 days. sometimes every day, sometimes every other day. I don't want to crowd her. In a last ditch attempt I invite her to a trip abroad with a humanitarian mission that would be a great opportunity for her and I. I tell her I like her in the message and want to get to know her better, however, I hear nothing back regarding that.

Eventually I call her and tell her that I still like her and want to make sure we are on the same page. She says she ""likes me as a friend"". Basically I get friend-zoned.

Against other people's wishes I maintain the invitation to the trip, I'm not a douchebag.Turns out she can come with me for the trip. I'm skeptical as to her motives; it would be a great opportunity and look good on a resume. I cut off communications with her unless absolutely necessary(i.e. pertaining to the trip). She hits me up a few times to talk, mainly about the trip, sometimes not.

The trip happens, and I'm guilty of still thinking that maybe something will happen. However, I seem to have lost all my confidence that I displayed previously and instead come of as tense. We have an alright time, sometimes she invites me over to watch movies. I don't push the boundary, I stick to what she said/wanted and keep it friendly. We go out on the last night before she leaves. She dresses up, saying that her mom wants her to dress more like a lady. Friends say that it was a sign she thought it was a date. Either way I'm oblivious, dinner goes well but without crazy event. I give her a bracelet I bought at the market earlier as a memento for her for the trip. She says she doesnt want it but I give it to her anyways. I wish her well in her future endeavors, thinking that this will likely be the last time I see her in my life. She leaves the next day. I text her every night afterwards and describe her what I did to make her not feel left out. Eventually I come back to the states.

Mistake #4 --&gt; Tense when I was with her alone; showed lack of confidence. Didn't perhaps make a move. But I wanted to be respectful of her and her wishes. I didn't want to come off as a douchebag.

I come back home. For some reason she maintains contact. She texts me maybe 1-3 times a month and asks some general questions about me and my life. I don't respond very well as I don't know what to make of it. As time goes on, however, I see the things that happened in an objective light and realize that I still do have some feelings for her. I remember our time together before the intl trip very often. Many times a day in fact. It seems to be bordering on obsession.

I ask her for the photos she took from the trip for a school report. A friend takes my phone one day and texts her that he wants one of the photos to be of her. she replies with just a what and I save face after retrieving my phone and say it was my high friend. She asks if he is my wingman. I confirm but also point out that he is high. Regardless, this weekend I text her again and she seems to be very friendly. Against my surrounding peers wishes, I chose to end the conversation and not throw any flirtatious bombs at her.

The problem is, I still have feelings for her. However, shes so far away now and I've botched my chances. Not clearly botched them, but relatively botched. I know getting a girl back via text messaging is stupid, but I don't know how to approach this. I'm not sure if I'm obsessed or what.

I guess what I want is neutral opinions on what happened. What do you make of it?

And if I were to continue ""pursuit"" how should I go about it? I'm not a good texter or phone caller. It's just not how I interact well. Is it still even possible with the distance between us? I've heard girls are selective with their time; how does that fit in here?

Or should I just try and let it go? If so, how? I seemingly have not been able to do it for 8 months over a ""small thing"" like making out, but it is what it is. I'm not going to fool myself.

As for seeing each other often, its more chance that that happened. We don't plan to see each other in the near future. It just worked out like that.

Dates:

7/11 : Met her last year in July

1/12: Went back in January; where all the shit went down

6/12: Went abroad with her

9/12: the current month

Thanks reddit for reading. Again, this is a general overview with some key specifics to give you a general idea of the situation. I wont mind any tl;dr comments, because it is lol. I know I'm still a young guy, but I just don't know what to do.

Pix sat at the holo-display looking quite smug.  Ren, who was sitting across from him, was quite irritated.

""Don't you give me that look,"" Ren growled.

Pix continued to smile smugly.

""Seriously, you're pissing me off.""

Pix scratched the top of his head, his expression unchanged.

""Research victories are stupid and you know it.""

Pix leaned forward.  ""I didn't destroy all of my Orbital Labs to mount a defense.  This is entirely on you.  You resisted the might of the Pixic Empire.  Speaking of which, I'd like my hat back.""

""No.  You're not getting that hat back.""

""Aw, come on.  It's just one loss.""

""A loss that is total bullcrap!"" Ren shouted.  ""That should have been a draw!""

""You set up the game, remember?  If you didn't want Research Victory enabled, you should have done something about it.  Please give me my hat.""

""No.""

""Well, can I at least have my leftover Pad Thai?  I'm hungry again.""

""We ate two hours ago!  And you ate more Pad Thai than anyone should be allowed to!  I'm frankly astonished they brought you enough to have leftovers!""

""Yes, well, that intern is a nice guy.""

""As much as I enjoy watching humans argue, I'm afraid I must cut it short.  The Spectre is here,"" a turian voice said.

The arguing couple turned around to find a turian they did not recognize.  He addressed their ignorance.

""I am Executor Doran.  Please, come with me.  We do not want to keep our guest waiting,"" the turian said, with the slightest tinge of resentment in his voice.

Pix and Ren shrugged and followed Doran out.  After a moment, Pix tapped the Executor on the shoulder.

""What is it, Mr. Xander?""

""You don't sound like you're entirely pleased with something,"" Pix stated.

Doran stopped and faced the human.  ""I am not pleased, thank you for noticing.""

""What's wrong?"" Ren asked.

""I assume Kretus told you that your idea was outside C-Sec's boundaries, right?""

""Yes,"" Pix replied.

""I believe that those boundaries should be strictly adhered to.  I become... displeased when some people go behind my back and call a Spectre to bend the rules for us,"" Doran's tone shifted towards polite.  ""Please, let us continue.  My opinions are apparently of no concern.""

Pix decided to drop the subject.  They continued in silence.  After a minute more of walking, they reached a door at the end of a hallway.

""Ms. O'Hare, please enter.  A headset is inside.  Please put it on and await further instruction,"" Doran explained.

As Ren opened the door, Doran put his hand on her shoulder.  ""Are you sure you're up for this?  I may not like this, but I do want it done well.""

Ren smiled at the turian.  ""Come on.  I've played RPGs since I was a freshman in high school.  I may not be a professional, but I can act.""  She closed the door behind her.

""RPGs?"" Doran puzzled.

""It's a nerd thing.  I'd explain, but it'd take a while.  The point is, she has experience,"" Pix explained.

Doran opened the door to the right.  ""We will monitor from here.""  He motioned for Pix to enter.

A salarian in combat armor sat at a console.  ""Executor,"" he greeted.

Doran spoke threateningly.  ""Listen, Spectre.  I don't care how much authority you have.  There are certain lines I will not allow to be crossed.""

The Spectre stood up.  ""I understand, Executor.  My objective is to sway these people from demolishing Wind Chill, nothing more.""

Doran forced a smile.  ""Very good.""

Pix raised his hand.  ""I have a question.""

""Yes, Mr. Xander?"" the Spectre replied.

""Why are you even doing this?  Isn't this a bit mundane for a Spectre?""

The Spectre laughed.  ""It's quite simple, really.  I'm a huge fan.  As a Spectre, I can pursue whichever cases I want.  I just so happen to have an investment in this one.""

""An investment?"" Pix asked.

The Spectre laughed again.  ""I need you guys to finish *Insurrection*!""

Pix was blown away.  ""Ah,"" he managed.

""Mr. Xander,"" Doran requested, ""we need you to enter the phone number.""

""Right.""  Pix unlocked his Omni-Tool.  He walked over to the console and copied the number over.  He looked over the display, where he could see Ren in the next room.  She patiently sat in the chair.

The Spectre held down a button.  ""Ms. O'Hare, are you ready to begin?""

""Yes,"" she replied.

Doran hit the button to begin the call.  It rang five times before the other end picked up.

""Spiks, I told you, I don't know where those calls came from!  Can't I just take a break?""

""You haven't changed at all,"" Ren began, sounding disappointed.

""Oh, god.  Lucy?  Lucy, is that you?""

""Yes.""

""Lucy!  I'm so sorry!  I didn't know what to do!  I was so scared!""

""And yet, here you are.  Nothing's changed.  You're still the same nothing I once knew.""

""I'm better now!  I have a job and everything!""

""You would say that.  I bet you think holding that detonator gives you power, doesn't it?""

""Um, no?"" the voice managed, unconvincingly.

""I died because of you.  Now more people are going to die.  Because of you.  You're no better than you were.  In fact, you're worse, because now you're trying to ruin people's lives.""

""I... don't have a choice.""

""Like hell you don't!  You can walk away right now!  Walk away, and turn yourself in.  You can never make what happened to me right, but you can still make things right for the people whose lives you hold in your hand!""

""Yes, I suppose you're right.  Except for one thing.""  There was a small click and the background audio changed to a higher pitch.  A different voice came though.  ""I'm not holding the detonator!""

Pix punched the console.  ""Spiks!  You bastard!""

Ren looked toward the window, completely baffled as to what to say.

""I know you can hear me, Xander.  You always were a little turd.  Did you honestly think I didn't expect this from you?  You always thought you were so funny and clever!  Who's clever now, you human piece of crap?"" Spiks laughed maniacally.  ""Let me remind you, in case you have forgotten.  33 hours.  Old Wind Chill.  No cops.  You will help me finish Kanpeki, whether you like it or not!""

The line went dead.

Pix stared at the call status window on the console.  ""Fuck."""

She is taking next year off to work (hasn't gone to college yet). 

-The plan is for me to graduate, then her to enter a University or College in a foreign country. I would move with her, using my degree (hopefully) to acquire a job that can sustain a reasonable form of living. She wouldn't pay for housing (not sure how expensive that is in places other than America) so she would have money to help with rent and other amenities. 

-We want to find a country that can support her academic needs, my employment needs, and our financial needs. Granted, it would be nice to live in a beautiful country-side cottage, but neither of us have room to be picky about where we go. Because I want to work nearby to wherever she goes to school, if not in the same town or city. 

-Which countries would you recommend that more or less fit this criteria? What are some good first steps to take? 

-Would it be more advisable for her to attend our local state university and use the assistance from academic scholarships to get a cheap(ish) degree? Meanwhile, I would build up my work experience - I have a couple internships lined up in wait, if I want to take them. 

EDIT: I've seen countless posts about the complications regarding work visas, sponsorships, etc. I don't want to seem ignorant of those realities. 

EDIT x2: Yes. Thank you for your downvotes. Contrary to what you'd expect, I actually *don't* need or want any help or insight, so I really won't mind if you bury this post and it goes unnoticed and ignored. Fuckin' Reddit, man. This website is absurd, sometimes."

Last year, as a junior, I applied for the Big Four for audit internships. I didn't get a single interview from anyone. Granted, I failed because I failed to build rapport with the people I've met at the information sessions (plus, my resume was complete shit). 

So, last summer, I picked up a job as a sales representative for a technology company and did some tax work for a non-profit that my friend was running. Not quite an internship, but I decided to slap it onto my resume anyways. 

I've consulted with some professors and they basically told me that the Big Four was not going to hire me at this point, not even for an internship. Fair enough. They told me to focus on smaller firms, like McGladrey and Grant Thornton, plus smaller regional firms as well, as well as one-office local firms. 

I recently spoke with the GT recruiter on a one on one basis and she told me that GT only takes people full time if they have 150 hours and hence, can sit for the CPA exam. I will be graduating with 124 hours. She encouraged me to do a Master of Accounting program and apply for the tax internship in October. (I'm interested in tax, not audit, now.)

During another McGladrey event, another HR lady/alumni from my school told me the same thing. 

I understand that networking is very important, and I will be frank: I haven't done as good of a job as I should have. One of my professors claims to have a lot of connections with really small firms and promises to help me out a little bit, but I get the feeling I'm alone. I'm seeing all of my friends starting their ""real jobs"" next year, while I'm still stuck doing something I don't necessarily like doing. 

One bit of good news, though: The career fair is coming up, and a lot of small regionals will be there, so I'm going to go to that this Thursday and network. I've already started reaching out to some recruiters via e-mail, so that will help me some, right?

So far, my strategy is this:

1. Take the GMAT soon.
2. Apply for MAcc programs at my school and at nearby schools. 
3. Apply for internships if the firm requires 150 hours to start. 
4. Apply for full-time positions if the firm is small/doesn't have a 150 hour requirement. 
5. Network!"

He was out there for three months at an internship and it was time to drive home. His parents flew me out to help because it's a long drive (to PA). Anyway, we land, bro-hug, and he brought out his green. Skipping ahead, we stop at in n' out burger (aww yeah). As we pull out into the street, a car comes speeding around a bend and we end up cutting them off, completely by accident. They (four Indian guys, well dressed, acted like they were on some more serious drugs) pulled ahead of us, cut off our car, got out and began throwing beer cans and such at us while one kid started walking towards us. My friend pulled a sweet reverse to drive 180 and we sped off and pulled in behind a hotel. Burger time, finally! But no, they found us. They trap us again and this time one kid runs at our car, punching the passenger window. He then hits the passenger side mirror, which shattered. We were lucky there was a second exit from the parking area and sped off again, now I'm also calling 911. Instead of stopping, we kept going and lost them, but for the next 30 minutes I was crazy paranoid and kept checking behind us for no reason. I only spent 1 hour and 45 minutes in LA and still managed to get in a car chase. 

Overall high review: little fun was had, mad paranoia took over, burgers were still delicious.

103lza,2,2012-09-18,"Low GPA and extracurricular activities, lots of work experience. Looking to join public accounting.",[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/103lza/low_gpa_and_extracurricular_activities_lots_of/,"Hello r/accounting!

First of all, awesome sub. Lots of valuable information here.

As stated in my title, I wish to join the public accounting industry as an auditor. Like most people here, I am VERY interested in joining one of the Big Four and due to its highly competitive nature, I have a few question to ask you informed individuals &lt;3. Background:

I am currently a senior at a UC (University of California). The campus does not have a very good reputation, but the Big Fours do come to recruit from the campus yearly. My overall GPA is 2.9 and major (Business Admin/Accounting) is 3.1. I am also a member of Accounting Society. Unfortunately, we do not have a chapter for BAP. I also do not have any sort of leadership role in any organization. I, however, was a peer adviser for the international students along with 20 other people for a year. Now, before you jump the gun and think, ""Holy shit this guy is a fail LOL,"" all of these are because of my work obligation. 

I have been working since 8th grade in my mom's business. It's a franchise retail business of a F500. The company is a leader in the industry. As mentioned, I have been running the business alongside my mom practically for 10 years. Whenever I'm not at school, I'm working. Mind you, the work also has pretty terrible hours. During school time, i would be putting in ~20-25 hours/wk and during break time ~70 hours/wk. I am compensated by my mom for working ~180 days/a year and I finance 100% of my college-related expenses. 

So, thanks to this job, my times are pretty limited and makes it especially hard to focus on internship and school activities. As much as I hate it, work comes first, no work = no money = no school :(. Plus, graveyard hours are holy crap terrible for working students.

Now, this work has to somehow have a positive impact on my life to make up for all these limitations imposed by it. The work is very client-oriented. Like auditors, we are practically always on client site. In my case, my clients are major grocery stores (Walmart, Ralph's, Albertson's, etc.). When my mom first bought the business, it was bringing in ~200k in revenue. 11 years later, it's averaging ~600k/year. Since it is our business, we are naturally hard workers. Working 12 hours/day is the norm. Luckily for me, this job had given me a lot of positive qualities that can be leveraged for other jobs. 

* **Clients relation**: because my mom does not speak English, I am the main communicator (even when I was a cute little 12 year old boy with 3 years of English experience). The work involves me communicating to the store managers and my district managers and working out a plan to increase sales. Driving sales is a win-win for both the clients and us because we are on a 100% commission deal. So, as the only one that can speak English, I grew up learning how to maintain a positive relationship with the clients and any other beneficial entities.

* **Details, details, details** - Due to the nature of retailing business, we have to constantly keep track of the accuracy of our inventory count, and thanks to my awesome young vision, that is also my role. On a daily basis, I am responsible for keeping track of the products coming in/out and what is in the truck and make sure that all the physical counts match with what's on the paper/invoices. It sounds pretty easy, and believe me, it is pretty easy. However, it becomes pretty challenging when it involves thousands of individual item on a daily basis. Like the balance sheet, at the end of the day, we want the physical count to match with what is on the paper and any missing items = $$ loss :'(. 

* **Accounting experience** - It is also our responsibility that we keep make sure that the invoices on our end matches with what the corporate has. On a weekly basis, we would be given a weekly settlement and my job is to make sure that everything adds up. This was my first accounting experience prior to college and it was pretty natural for me to scan through stack of papers for mistakes. 

* **Customer Service** - Customer service is probably my biggest strength when it comes to this job. We are there at the client site providing service 363 days a year (stores are closed on Christmas/Thanksgiving :/ ), whereas our competitors take 2 days off per week. Thanks to this, we are seen as reliable in contrast to our competitors. For example, this past Labor Day, my products are supposed to sell really awesome and I planned out # of displays and their locations with the managers at Walmart to make sure there are no missed opportunity. Well, the following day my competitor came in and was amazed with how many displays we had up and went to ask the manager for some. He was responded with: ""We can't give you any."" Naturally he was furious and asked why he cannot have any when I had so many up. The managers literally told him: ""Well, you are not here 7 days a week like *my name* and you're going to be off on Labor Day, so how can I trust that you can keep up with the demands?"" 

Now mind you, this competitor also carries Walmart private label brands and for the manager to told him off in favor of me/my mom is a huge recognition on our service.

So, this is becoming extremely long and I just got back from work (I start at 2 AM) and about to take a nap. My question is: am I in the position to leverage my work experience enough so that recruiters would look past my low GPA, no leadership role, and lack of networking with them? 

Thank you r/Accounting for reading my long, uninteresting concerns :) I will now take a nap. Thanks again guys!"

",WHATTODO128,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/103lvh/midlife_crisis_in_college_kinda_long_post_but/,"Due to some personal reasons I had to take a break from school for a year following my Junior year. I also ended up having to transfer to a school closer to home that was MUCH less prestigious than my first school. During the year break though, I was able to take a closer look at trends in the job market, and see what my friends were doing.

Since high school, the plan was to always major in Poly Sci then go straight to law school. As some of you may be aware, the law industry is bullshit. So if I am not doing law school, my Liberal Arts degree is basically bullshit.

But after having seen what my friends are doing, and also having seen trends in the job market, I feel like the only thing that will yield any sort of success after college is engineering or business. I'm not incredible at the quantitative side of things, but have very strong analytical and inference skills. Hence why I'm looking more at business, and more specifically, Management Consulting.

So I'm about to enter my senior year. If I stuck with my Liberal Arts degree I could graduate in a semester.

But now that I'm looking at business/econ, it's probably going to take two more years to graduate This means I'll end up being two years behind my peers. I'll also have to spend much more time at a school I frankly don't really want to be at...especially since how I worked so damn hard to be at the first school that I ended up having to withdraw at.

So here is where I need some help. Should I just finish the degree, and attempt to get into Management Consulting with no prior internships or education in business/econ, OR spend another two years learning business/econ, and having an internship in the summer and then try to get into MC?

Firms won't come out to my school to recruit, I'd have to tap into my network to get an interview.

Here is some more info about me

LSAT: 173 GPA: 3.72 (bullshit political science though)

NO prior experience in business/econ. All prior employment has been in policy development, law firms, and mayoral campaigns.

Please help!

103lur,5,2012-09-18,"So I'm Thinking of Breaking Up With Evangelicalism... Need Your Advice/Prayers, /r/Christianity",KingCrimson250,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/103lur/so_im_thinking_of_breaking_up_with_evangelicalism/,"So here's the deal. Been evangelical for most of my Christian life. That's the tradition that I encountered Christ through, and the tradition that nurtured me through my early Christian years.

The problem is, though, is that I've gone off and gotten my undergrad in theology, and that's opened up a whole new world of Christianity to me. I've begun reading more and more broadly, and its begun opening up a new thirst to learn more about who God is.

Why is this a problem? Because in my experience, evangelicals really don't like the idea of people being well-read. I know that's a harsh thing to say, but it's true. Every evangelical church I've been to has kind of got it's pet list of authours and pastors that you are expected to agree with, and if you don't agree with them, or if you question them, you're treated differently, like you're obviously not quite at the level of spiritual maturity they want you to be at.

The evangelical churches near me are huge on guys like John Piper and D.A. Carson, authors who, while good men serving the Lord, aren't people who I have a great deal of respect for on a theological level. 

But here's where the problem comes in: I find that within the framework of these churches, I can't honestly pursue God, because I'm expected to kind of fit into this New-Calvinist mould, and if I don't, I'm given these disapproving looks and suggested a Piper book that I would ""really benefit from reading.""

And so it's all kind of come to the point where I feel as though evangelicalism is attempting to interfere with my pursuit of God, because they're so wrapped up in ensuring that everyone adheres to their personal approach to Christianity they end up demonizing anyone who disagrees.

Telling people that I'm an egalitarian who doesn't believe in YEC was like the evangelical version of ""coming out."" And the big problem is, I'm not just a church-goer. I'm a wannabe pastor. I've been doing training and internships for church ministry. And if you're a member of the leadership team in one of these churches and you start asking these questions, then you're REALLY in trouble. Which to me makes no sense at all. Your faith journey doesn't just become cryogenically frozen because you've started getting paid full-time for your ministry.

I actually had an entire denomination of evangelicals shut me down and refuse to work with me just because I wanted to do my M.Div (or MTS, not sure yet) at a seminary that leans towards egalitarianism!


And so I'm really coming closer and closer to breaking up with the evangelical church. I call it breaking up because that's really what it feels like. I've got an emotional attachment to this church, and they're great people and they do great things, but there are too many problems in our relationship and I just can't see myself spending the rest of my life with them. 

But I don't know if things get any better outside of evangelicalism. I've reached a sort of theological moderateness, which means liberal Christians don't like me because I'm too conservative, and conservative Christians don't like me because I'm too liberal, so I don't really feel as though I fit in anywhere.

All I want is a church where I can honour what I perceive to be a calling from God to enter into full-time ministry in a church (because I've tried other things, other methods and ideologies of ministry. They're good, but there's something about working in the church itself that just feels ""right,"" almost as though it's where I'm meant to be) while still being faithful to my pursuit of relationship with God.

Any advice?"

103922,14,2012-09-18,I might be at a turning point in my life...,japko,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/103922/i_might_be_at_a_turning_point_in_my_life/,"I want to tell the world something. Nobody might read it, I know, but I feel it has to be said.

I was never keen to hard work, I was pedaling along, finishing assignments, rarely doing anything extra. I was a fairly good student in school, mut nothing marvelous. I was second-to-last on the list of students accepted to my high school, and in the last 10% of students accepted to my major - psychology. I can't say it was bad though, because my high school was the 3rd best in my 600 000-inhabitants city, and there were 18 candidates per 1 place at my major. But that doesn't matter. 

All that time I was merely a guy who just wanted not to fail the class/test/whatever. No scientific circles in college, no conferences (well, actually I went to one during these 5 years, just one), no scholarships, no extra internships, the average from my grades was 3,6 (on 2-5 scale). One of the reasons for choosing this particular major was that I heard it was easy. Also, I had almost no friends from my faculty. I was a procrastination lord and master and I hated myself so much for it. ALL my attempts at self improvement, getting better grades/whatever were a perpetual streak of failure after failure. Now I have a master's degree in a science that, I admit - is very interesting for me, but nevertheless, the small amount of studying and extracurricular activities I have taken make me feel incompetent. 

At some point things started to stirr up. I had a nasty, nasty breakup with my girfriend, and it took me a year to free myself from being depressed. As a consequence I took part in two student exchange programmes, so I spent two semesters out of my city, and, what's more important - I started to think a lot. About myself, about what I want, about who I am and who I'd like to be, and about where I'm going and why. But I couldn't change the way I behaved, no matter what, and it left me being as ambiguous about my major as I always were (so strongly ambiguous). This has led me to start therapy and I have been going to a therapist for 6 months, that was as much as I could afford. What I did in therapy and in my own, private ""search"" made me understand more, and with time, I began slowly improving. I can do more of the stuff that I want to do, I procrastinate less. It's my first steps, I'd say I'm at 10% of the change I want to achieve, but I think something finally moved - I've started noticing this since a couple of weeks.

Anyway, because I felt I didn't really get the most of my studies, and because I don't really see myself working in my field right now for a number of reasons, I decided that I'd prefer to do something else in life, at least for now. This whole time studying psychology, I was thinking about engineering, but I was always afraid that it'd be too hard for me. I always found this field to be very interesting, though. On my 4th year in college I tried to enroll to a technical university and I failed. Next year, which is 2012, so now, (5 years after high school) I retook my post-high-school math test and tried to enroll again, but failed to get myself accepted to a public engineering programme that I wanted most (in my country public, free of charge higher education is considered better that paid education). So I said, fuck that, Imma apply to paid studies. Same college, same major, but I pay for classes. 

So here I am. I started classes today. I'm on a brink of the most difficult thing I have ever tried to do. Even though I do have a plan B (which is a career in psychotherapy or HR), I'm scared shitless. I don't want to make resolutions about how I will now change my ways forever, because I did that a million times with little result (at least until recently). 

I just want to try to do stuff right this time. It's going to be fucking hard, and motivation and self-organisation is what I need. That's why I posted this here. I don't have a lot of support in my friends or family, and I just wanted to get all this out of my system.

**TL;DR I had a passive life with lots and lots of procrastination and hating myself for it. Things that happened in my life in the last 3 years might have helped me move a bit towards a positive change. Now I'm going back to college to try to get an engineering degree. Wish me luck.**

PS - if you know some sites about math, that have explanations and lessons for idiots, it'd be great if you'd share."

1035qa,2,2012-09-18,College senior in a semi-crisis.. ,WHATTODO128,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1035qa/college_senior_in_a_semicrisis/,"Due to some personal reasons I had to take a break from school for a year following my Junior year. I also ended up having to transfer to a school closer to home that was MUCH less prestigious than my first school. During the year break though, I was able to take a closer look at trends in the job market, and see what my friends were doing. 

Since high school, the plan was to always major in Poly Sci then go straight to law school. As some of you may be aware, the law industry is bullshit. So if I am not doing law school, my Liberal Arts degree is basically bullshit. 

But after having seen what my friends are doing, and also having seen trends in the job market, I feel like the only thing that will yield any sort of success after college is engineering or business. I'm not incredible at the quantitative side of things, but have very strong analytical and inference skills. Hence why I'm looking more at business, and more specifically, Management Consulting. 

So I'm about to enter my senior year.  If I stuck with my Liberal Arts degree I could graduate in a semester.

But now that I'm looking at business/econ, it's probably going to take two more years to graduate This means I'll end up being two years behind my peers. I'll also have to spend much more time at a school I frankly don't really want to be at...especially since how I worked so damn hard to be at the first school that I ended up having to withdraw at.

So here is where I need some help. Should I just finish the degree, and attempt to get into Management Consulting with no prior internships or education in business/econ, OR spend another two years learning business/econ, and having an internship in the summer and then try to get into MC?

Firms won't come out to my school to recruit, I'd have to tap into my network to get an interview. 

Here is some more info about me

LSAT: 173
GPA: 3.72 (bullshit political science though)

NO prior experience in business/econ. All prior employment has been in policy development, law firms, and mayoral campaigns. 

Please help!

1035kx,2,2012-09-18,"[Advice] Got an opportunity I'm not sure if I should pursue or not, but need to make my decision immediately.",accountingthrowaway0,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1035kx/advice_got_an_opportunity_im_not_sure_if_i_should/,"Throwaway because my primary account can be linked to my real university.

My university offers a fairly competitive/exclusive program which specifically targets the Big 4. The program all but guarantees an internship with the Big 4 in your senior year, with essentially the only caveat being that you can be kicked for poor GPA (probably not unusual). I've made it through the application process, and am facing an interview in the near-ish future. At that interview, I'm essentially going to be asked if I'm certain that I would accept an internship with the Big 4. I obviously wouldn't be *required* to take a job, if offered one, but the internship is pretty much core to the program.

Ideally, I would like to go into fraud/forensics. It's what first made me consider accounting, and I really like it. My university offers an excellent masters program in Internal Audit, and that program is not mutually exclusive with this program I've been invited to. However, dropping out of the program I'm interviewing for would reflect *extremely* poorly on me, later. It would burn a number of bridges with a significant section of the upper level accounting faculty at my school. Basically, I need to decide this week if I'm willing to commit to an internship at the Big 4 if offered one.

So my question to you guys is - how would an internship in the Big 4 look if I didn't pursue a job with the firm I intern for? Will it reflect poorly on me? I've heard that the Big 4 doesn't really have much for Fraud/Forensic, that I'd be better off looking for smaller, more specialized firms. Is that true?

Basically, my big concern is that I might accidentally lock myself onto a path that won't lead me to my end goal of a job in forensics. Should I be worried about that, or just sit down, shut up, and take the best opportunities I can find?"

Those two opportunities just fell into my lap, though. I don't know how to search for professional jobs. I've put my name in at a contracting firm at the suggestion of a coworker, but that's all i've done besides contacting the other place and updating my LinkedIn profile.

102zvl,1,2012-09-18,Fiance's younger brother accidentally knocked a girl up.,[deleted],childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/102zvl/fiances_younger_brother_accidentally_knocked_a/,"Backstory:

My fiance M26 and I F23 have been engaged for two years. We are set to marry next October. He and I are CF, and I am finishing school while he is working (he already finished his master's).

His younger brother, 23, spent the summer working at a casino as an internship for cooking school. He does not have a degree, but has left about two degrees halfway, and his parents are left to shoulder the costs. We are hoping he finishes cooking school. 

My fiance got a call from his mother this past weekend, and she shared some news. 

The brother knocked up a summer fling. They waited four months to tell his parents, and it was obvious he didn't want to do so, and was scared to share the news. His parents had somewhat already heard, since the girl was dumb enough to put it on FB before he told his family. 

Oh, and he decided to move across the country to be with her. They've known each other for like two months.

She is in school as well, and it is our assumption that she will not finish. Thus, the brother will be left to be the breadwinner, and probably not finish his degree as well.  

My fiance's dilemma is this:

His parents always bail his younger brother out, and he is concerned that this ""accident"" will prevent his folks from retiring and finishing the payments on their house. (They are almost done paying for it.)

He does not get along well with his brother, as he is angry at all of the mooching he does on his parents. (My fiance has been financially independent for years, and sees all this mooching as irresponsible).

My fiance wants to send his brother a message pretty much telling him that he'd better not ask to be bailed out, blah blah blah.

I seem to think that since they don't have a good relationship, the brother will take any aggressive message as bad, and ignore it completely. My idea is to reach out to him, but more in a manner of advice. 

Any ideas on how to best communicate to the brother that he'd better not expect to be saved once again by his folks?"

102w43,2,2012-09-18,wanted: health advice for chronic pain (47 days of constant pelvic pain now).,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/102w43/wanted_health_advice_for_chronic_pain_47_days_of/,"**So for all those that don't like to read long things: Should I wait another week to go to my obgyn or should I just go to the hospital today? Ive already been to my PCP twice and my OBGYN once. I also had a pelvic sonogram when the pain first started.**

More information for those that don't mind reading:
On July 31 I went to my PCP for pelvic pain (and another issue that they were able to figure out and it has since resolved itself--fibrocystic breasts). At that time, the pelvic pain was NOT constant, but sharp pain that felt like a pulled muscle when you move ""wrong."" I only had the doctor look at it because when poking around my hips it felt like there was a lump. The doctor said it might be an ovarian cyst and that we would wait and watch. I did not want to ""wait and see,"" so I was able to get an OBGYN appt for the next day. I went there, she did a pelvic exam, felt ""fullness,"" and sent me for a pelvic sonogram (This was on 8.1). 

On 8.3, the pelvic pain became constant and I guess dull and achy (but I don't like calling it dull because it definitely hurts and I feel like I am minimizing my pain when I call it such--it is not sharp stabbing pain like it had been). I received the sonogram on 8.7. The tech got over my left ovary and said is this where the pain is? (I said: Yes it is. Do you see something?) She said she saw a cyst and went on with the sonogram. Then told me I'd here something from the doctor soon. I heard from my OBGYN about 2 weeks later saying that the sonogram was clean. I brought up what happened with the tech. They said it was a follicle and that I was ovulating. I was on my period during the sonogram. If I was ovulating like they said, I would've been on my period two weeks after the sonogram (I was not-cycle lasted 28 days like usual). I waited for my period so that I could rule out ovulation (painful ovulation last hours to a max of a couple days). Nothing helps the pain. At some point between now and 8.7, the pain went from being localized to the left to being on both sides (Kind of like a mirror: Same place but other side too). This brings us to 9.13, my next dr appt. The appt was with my PCP because I was not able to get an appt with my OBGYN until Sept 24th. 

My symptoms (I do not know if they are all related): pelvic pain that is constant, dull and achy(ish). Low back pain (I have had back pain for ages, but it has been everyday for a couple weeks, and is much more painful than normal. Frequent urination. Fatigue (probably because the pain makes it hard to sleep, and just because being in pain everyday takes a lot out of you.)

What the PCP did: Had me leave a pee sample (they did a pregnancy test and it was negative), They called the imaging center to see the sonogram and said that yes, it did look normal. They felt my my abdominal area and listened to it with a stethoscope. After that she told me she had no idea what was causing my pain, but that she thinks it is gynecological and that I should still see my OBGYN on the 24th. They also drew blood, but I don't really know what they are looking for. She wants me to call her after I go to the OBGYN because she wants to make sure that someone is dealing with my pain. She didnt want to step on their toes, but if they do not seemed concerned, she will discuss what to do next.

This whole time, I contemplate going to the hospital. I think that maybe if I do, I will be able to find out what it wrong. I do not want any pain meds. I want it fixed. I'm sitting here in pain as I type this. Part of me thinks I should wait because I've already waited this long. It interferes with my job (I am a teaching internship, and standing all day leaves every inch of me aching and I want to burst into tears while I am teaching--which is very unprofessional). 

**SO the big question is: Should I keep waiting OR should I go to the hospital?**"

Help me out?

His full Name is: Willard Mitt Romney
He was Born: March 12, 1947 and is 65 years old.
His Father: George W. Romney, former Governor of
the State of Michigan
He was raised in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan
He is Married to Ann Romney since 1969;
they five children.
Education:
B.A. from Brigham Young University,
J.D. and M.B.A. from Harvard University
Religion:
Mormon - The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints
Working Background:
After high school, he spent 30 months in France as a Mormon
missionary.
After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law
School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar exam, but
never worked as an attorney.
In 1984, he co-founded Bain Capital a private equity investment
firm, one of the largest such firms in the United States .
In 1994, he ran for Senator of Massachusetts
and lost to Ted Kennedy.
He was President and CEO of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.
In 2002, he was elected Governor of the State of Massachusetts
where he eliminated a 1.5 billion deficit.
Some Interesting Facts about Romney:
Bain Capital, starting with one small office supply store in
Massachusetts, turned it into Staples; now over 2,000 stores
employing 90,000 people.
Bain Capital also worked to perform the same kinds of business
miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy,
Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group,
Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others.
He was an unpaid volunteer campaign worker for his dad's
gubernatorial campaign 1 year.
He was an unpaid intern in his dad's governor's office for eight
years.
He was an unpaid bishop and stake president of his church for
ten years.
He was an unpaid President of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee
for three years.
He took no salary and was the unpaid Governor of Massachusetts
for four years.
He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity.
Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest self-made men in our
country but has given more back to its citizens in terms of money,
service and time than most men.
And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost
19% of his income....
Just for comparison purposes, Obama gave 1%
and
Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%.
Mitt Romney is Trustworthy:
He will show us his birth certificate
He will show us his high school and college transcripts.
He will show us his social security card.
He will show us his law degree.
He will show us his draft notice.
He will show us his medical records.
He will show us his income tax records.
He will show us he has nothing to hide.
Mitt Romney's background, experience and trustworthiness show
him to be a great leader and an excellent citizen for President of the
United States.
You may think that Romney may not be the best representative the
Republicans could have selected. At least I know what religion he is,
and that he won't desecrate the flag, bow down to foreign powers, or
practice fiscal irresponsibility. I know he has the ability to turn this
financial debacle that the current regime has gotten us into.
We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt,
but someone with Romney's background can do it.
He never was a ""Community Organizer"", never took drugs or smoked
pot, never got drunk, did not associate with communists or terrorists,
nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for God to damn the U.S."

I am going to college in a week. I am considering committing suicide. It is not an urgent issue, but I have been seriously thinking about this for quite some time. I still have hope because I would like to wake up in the distant future.

There are a few reasons for this. First of all, my family life is complete shit. Everyone, and I mean everyone in my family has died save my father. My mom died when I was 2 and all of my grandparents are dead. My only living relative is my father.

Naturally, he is depressed too. He has no hobbies, no real friends, nor a girlfriend. So he constantly tries to get approval from me, constantly saying ""I love you"" (literally) every 15 minutes or so. There is no substance to our relationship other than the fact that I am his entire world to him. We don't talk about anything else. It is suffocating.

Secondly, I believe that I may be transgendered. Obviously, people would tell me the solution would be to go to therapy and try to transition, but it's not that simple. If I am indeed transgendered (I'm not even sure if I am, I just might have a fucked up fetish), I would not be a real woman. I would have to ""unlearn"" 18 years of being male, adapt to being female and have to cope with having a lot of masculine features (including a deep voice, masculine face, narrow hips, etc).  I would also not be able to get pregnant and have kids. I would also have to deal with all of the transgender phobia that is circulating around. You have no idea how many people lost their jobs, friends, and sometimes lives because of this.

Thirdly, the line of work I'm getting into is not what I want to do and it robbed me of my childhood. Computer science. Instead of learning how to play basketball or skateboard I learned computer programming in middle school and neglected social interaction. I continued to do so thoughout high school, I was proud of the fact that I would become a software engineer when I grew up. However, I ha an internship at a silicon valley startup this summer and I realized I absolutely hate programming now. I would never want to do it as a job. I'm already in an engineering school and I don't know how to get out of it. I am also trying to be more social, I realize the more social and gregarious I am, my skill in computer programming diminishes. I prefer socializing over programming. 

Now, the reason for killing myself and cryogenically freezing myself is mainly because of the transgender thing. I believe in the future people will be able to get sex changes much easier than you can today (because of stem cell technology). I can just take these stem cells that will allow my penis to turn into a REAL vagina without any surgery and I would be able to have those feminine features that I would not be able to have if I transitioned today. There would also be no transphobia or discrimination because people would learn that it is a condition similar to being homosexual. This would cure most of my depression. Also, my mom is currently cryogenically frozen right now and my dad is planning on doing it as well, so in this future I will also have the family I always wanted. The computer science problem will also be solved because I will have a lot of money saved in the bank that will have accrewed interest.

Now, I have been fantasizing about this for a while. I know this is very risky but I honestly don't care anymore. I either want to be happy or be dead (at least when I'm dead there are the infinite possibilities of the afterlife I have to look forward to).

I know I am not thinking rationally right now, so I would like a rational persons input. Thank you."

I've read some posts here and I noticed, that a lot of redditors trying to help each other. I like that! I like that alot! And it gives me the feeling, that there are still good people on this planet...something that I'm missing right now at my job...

But let's start at the beginning.
I'm a student at a German university and I'm very close to my final bachelor's degree. Additionally I work as a journalist for a big newspaper for nearly two years now. Between my terms I write and produce there every day. Often for about 12 - 14 hours a day. Even in term I try to be there every day. My boss likes my work and I perform tasks, that no other free writers are allowed to do. He promised me, that I can start my ""editorial-journalist-education"" (I don't know if this is the right expression, in German its called ""Volontariat"") after my bachelor's degree (will be around february, march next year).
But yesterday he introduced to us a new free author. A girl, that I know from university. She's annoying like hell, thinks she's better than everybody else and told me once, that she would never work for this newspaper. She had some internships by big news channels and some bigger magazines. But now, she stands here in my office and wants the job, that I have worked for over the past two years! And my boss said to her, that she can have an internship here for three months and after that, they will decide, if she can do her ""editorial-journalist-education"" here.
I'm so angry about this situation, that I couldn't sleep this night. I love to work there and I get my whole self-esteem out of my work for the newspaper! It's pretty much the only thing I can be proud of. But today I had to literally punch myself to show up there...
I told my boss, that I have a problem with this girl and the situation. He said, that we have to see how this will work...

I don't know how to handle this situation right now. We have to cooperate very close here and I'm a person who likes to have a calm and nice environment to work in. But with her in the office, I can't even act like I'm ok with the situation...

What should I do? I'm right now at a point where I even don't know if I am the one who's the problem I appreciate every comment, thanks.

Sorry for my English, I tried to make as few mistakes as possible. It's some time since my last lesson.


EDIT: I thank everyone for your thoughts! Thank you very much! For your views on this situation and for opening my eyes. As I read through the comments yesterday I realized that I act a little ""childish"". Yeah there's a super stupid girl now at my job. Yeah, I have to deal with her for the next three months. But she has to do same the other way around. I'll keep up my work and push me just more now. 
So I started with that just now! I just began with my new feature-story about this very site, reddit. 
So again thank all of you! If I would have thought this over and over by myself (as I usually do...), I probably would slowed myself down just because I'm pissed off.
Aaaand I learned that my English teacher lied to me about this little friend "",""  thanks for that too ;)"
102m5l,3,2012-09-18,I have absolutely no motivation or ambition. ,bloodfyr,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/102m5l/i_have_absolutely_no_motivation_or_ambition/,"I'm set to graduate this semester. I picked a major that has little potential without grad school (English) because grad school's always been in the cards for me. For the past two years, getting my MLIS and becoming some form of librarian has been my goal. I've always liked libraries, ever since I was a kid. Working in one has always appealed to me for various idealistic reasons. 

But over the past few weeks, I've been really analyzing this decision and have been kinda stressing out about it. I've come to the conclusion that I have absolutely no motivation or ambition, at least in terms of something career-wise, and I think that's why I settled on my MLIS. A very competitive, stressful job is the last thing I want and from all indications from the research I've done and the people I've talked to, certain specializations/jobs within the field lend themselves well to that sort of thing. My cousin has a really low-key job in the field and a lot of time to dedicate to her hobbies, and honestly? That's all I want. Something that'll pay comfortably enough to live on (and my standards of ""comfortable"" are lower than most) and to let me indulge in my hobbies. 

This is rambly and borderline-nonsensical because I'm tired, but I guess the question I want to ask in the end is: is lack of ambition/motivation weird? Are there others like me? I feel so out of place in a world where I read about people who've worked six internships before getting their Bachelor's. One of my TAs in freshmen year told us about how he had a paper published in a leading Anthropology magazine by his sophomore year. I have absolutely no inclination to do any of that. Is a lack of ambition normal?"
102lpj,1,2012-09-18,No sleep,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/102lpj/no_sleep/,"There's so much going on I don't even know where to begin. I've gotten in this overly optimistic mode and I feel like the reality of everything that's happening to me is slowly setting in and I'm trying to block it out.

First of all due to being behind in schoolwork and house upkeep, this is the second night in a row that I have stayed up all night. Yes I know it's unhealthy but this is one of those rare times where I just NEED to catch up.

Speaking of which I have concerns for graduation. Due to a late start to the major, a high unit count (17-19) for the past year (including the summer), I haven't really had time to look into jobs yet. All the other Accounting majors already have internships now or jobs lined up for later. A online community I enjoy for accounting research is making it clear that I am nothing more than sub-par in terms of qualifications. It's making me very cynical. I am a positive person but lately I've been saying/thinking some really negative stuff. I feel irrelevant...like I'm ready to do something important but no one is noticing me. There was a meeting on campus today that didn't go well and some people were not very encouraging.

My dad had a PET scan today because there is a tumor in his kidney and suspicious fluid in his stomach. I am taking it well. I think. I don't know. Ignoring it. Telling myself it will be alright to the extent that I don't think anything is wrong with him. After all, they can just go in and remove everything. He's 55 and I'm just 22, nothing is going to be wrong. But I feel weird about it.

They put my childhood dog to sleep yesterday so that's a part of home that I will never get back.

I am working on the side of school writing papers for a good wage in order to help support myself. That's why I pulled the first all nighter.

I have the rough draft of a big project due in 8 hours and I have barely started.

I'm doing this weird thing where my free time is intersparsed between my work so I never really sit down to just relax for a few hours. I'll just browse reddit for like a half hour then go right back to work then sleep then repeat.

I have a wonderful living area near a beach and an amazing girlfriend so I hadn't really been hit with reality until tonight when I stayed up again.

It's starting to affect me all the fatigue and everything. For like the past four hours I haven't done anything really. You can probably even tell by the randomness of this post

So my question: I have class in the morning, 3 hour break, then class in the afternoon. I MUST be in these classes, I was gone a week due to bacterial bronchitis and used up absences. How do I space everything...like how should I spend the 3 hour break?

I was blissfully happy until tonight. It's one of those ""I feel it all"" days. Up to now I was just incredibly happy.

What do I do?",Numboman,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/102k13/reddit_im_18_years_old_my_grades_are_horrid_i_am/,"The grades I just received from my final examinations were abhorrent. I haven't been a good student, yet my parents are forcing me to go to college. I know I'm just going to be wasting my father's money. That's what I've been doing in school, wasting money. I keep trying to tell them to stop trying, I can't do any better in school, I wish I could, but I can't, but they won't listen. My dad's financial situation has gotten worse in this economy and I can't bear to burden him by having him drag my pathetic ass through college unwillingly. They think I'll never get a job unless I have a degree, and it looks like they're right. Everywhere I've looked, jobs ask for people with at least an undergraduate degree and years of experience. The one and only thing I've found myself good at is creative copywriting and every job I look for, even the most entry level of entry level positions, tell me to send in my résumé and I have 1 month of experience at a low grade ad agency where the dick Creative Director rejected everything I pitched in, because the office worked on a commission system (the less people on the credits, the bigger each person's cut) so I have no portfolio, and even when I applied for an internship at BBDO, they asked me to send in a portfolio. Nobody's going to hire an 18 year old dropout, that much is apparent.

I don't know what to do and where to go. There's no place in Chicago where I want to work and can work. If I work at McDonalds or something, I'll be paid minimum wage and I want to move out of my parents' swanky ass apartment, because I don't deserve to be there and I don't want to face my parents every day. I've disappointed them enough. However, again, nobody's going to let an 18 year old with a net worth of about 800 bucks and a few electronics sign a lease and there's no way I can expect to pay rent and utilities in Chicago at minimum wage, the taxes are nearly 10% now. To top it off, my older brother and sister are the very opposite of the spectrum for me; they've shaped my parents expectations. My brother graduated as a business major and is now working at a company and recently raked in about sixty thousand dollars in pure commission and bought himself a Saab on a whim. He's set and on his way to becoming exactly what my dad wanted for us. He also despises me for what I am, and rightfully so. My sister is in college, but she's well on her way to finishing her media and journalism double major and has already produced a major media event and moved out. There's no way I can live up to my parents' expectations and I've already contemplated suicide many times. I've never done it, because I know nobody's going to take care of my cat when I die and I really don't want to end the one shot I have at life and I know that there is a way to make it better. I just don't know it yet. Anybody know what course of action I can take from here on out?"

I am a 23 year old unemployed graduate of a decent, but by no means top-tier, university with a BS in Chemistry and BA in Pure Math. My grades were pretty good, I had a fair amount of merit scholarships, but I centered my undergrad career solely around chemistry. In fact I picked up math mainly for fun and to help support my former plans to be a physical chemist. 

   Last year, around this time of the year, I moved to another state to be a chemistry Ph.D student. Turns out things didn't go so smoothly, I lost interest in chemistry, moved back to my hometown in the San Francisco Bay Area a month ago and was forced to move in with my parents. Right after I dropped I really lost all my confidence in everything and my motivation completely tanked. I couldn't even get the will to go out and look for a job, I feel like I just failed at everything.  I've been out for 4 months now and it's still not completely back. I really want to try though!

   Considering my background and the fact that I always did prefer math a bit more to chemistry, I really want to try to make some serious plans for the future. The main hindrance is that my math degree did not  entail any formal programming courses so I basically have no experience coding (I'm working on this though. Trying the courses on MIT opencourseware.). That said I have two options in front of me that I have a bit of interest in pursuing: working on going back to school and eventually becoming a [quantitative analyst](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rlp2h/iama_wall_street_quant_amaa/c46to5b) or taking advantage of my location finding an internship and trying out the tech startup industry in San Francisco.

   The first option has some obvious drawbacks because of the barrier of going back to grad school in a completely different discipline (most likely statistics) which I have no contacts, no experience outside the classroom, and of course the financial barrier of supporting myself while trying to get these first two items before even trying grad school again. 

   The second option only came up recently when I made friend at the gym who is the cofounder of his own tech startup. He brought me to a happy hour at a coworking place and it really opened my eyes to how large the tech startup industry really is. Many are web, iPhone, Android developers and seem to be having the time of their life. It was really the first time I felt invigorated by a prospective future plan in a long time. Again, I have trouble because of my lack of coding experience, but I'd really like to try maybe interning at one of these companies. Would this be feasible? How would I even doctor up my resume to even think about applying to one of these? 

   I just feel so lost now that I'm not in school anymore, but at the same time I'm really up for trying new things. I'm not going to lie though, it is terrifying going into a field you know nearly nothing about.

102hwa,5,2012-09-18,Are there any unpaid summer internships?,[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/102hwa/are_there_any_unpaid_summer_internships/,"The reason I ask is because I personally don't feel that my resume is impressive enough yet to warrant an internship.  As of right now, I'm a 2nd year Mathematics major at UT Austin, 3.04 GPA, I have a little experience with Java, Python, and Excel, I have a leadership position in my fraternity, my only job experience is high school math tutoring and possibly working for the office of admissions at my university (will hopefully hear back soon), and I'm currently in Probability, planning on taking P/1 in the Spring.  I'm willing to go anywhere in the US for a summer internship.

The reason I ask is because if I didn't get an internship, I would just take summer classes and end up graduating a semester early.  I really don't see a point in doing so, especially considering how much I love college and college life.  I'm already relatively young for most people my grade (won't turn 21 until the summer before my 4th year) and want to enjoy my nonworking years for as long as I have left.  My parents have no problem paying for me to do an unpaid internship, as long as I'm doing something."

However, I'm not really digging my CS classes: They are very theoretical so far, and I haven't learned to program so much as I have learned to do programming exercises. I'm one class away from a CS Minor, so if I decide to major in Math, then I would definitely do that if not a few more classes. 

On the other hand, I have thoroughly enjoyed my Calc I-III sequence and I'm currently taking a proofs class and Linear Algebra I. I feel that Math is more difficult to teach yourself than programming is. Also, it seems my school's Math department has much better professors. 

I probably want a job programming though. Do Math majors have luck finding these jobs? Could I still get internships that CS majors normally take?

I could live with myself if I don't find a programming job. What other techy/mathy jobs should a Math major look for?"

She's been angry because she hasn't landed her dream job already, and also angry because her school didn't basically do the job-searching for her.  However she isn't a quiet and emo depressed kind of person, she's the kind who pouts on fb and is also quite rude to others now.  I've even seen her lash out at people who've gotten an internship at Pixar, or lash out at others who don't tell her what she wants to hear.

102ew8,1,2012-09-18,"High School Senior Looking to Enter the Industry, But Nothing is Clear",[deleted],truegaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/102ew8/high_school_senior_looking_to_enter_the_industry/,"I'm a High School senior, who for a couple of years now has been considering entering the game industry as my long-term career. This used to be idle, noncomitted assumption, but as of late it's gotten rather serious. At this point, I've decided concretely that I want a college experience directly pointing me toward the gaming industry, and I have thus oriented all the college research that comes with one's Senior year toward getting a handle on what the industry needs from me, which colleges can supply it for me, and where I'd be happy spending the next four-some years of my life.

My problem? There seems to be no consensus, or even anything resembling a consensus about the task I have before me, beyond the simple chant that everybody seems to be parroting in this sort of discussion: “The Gaming industry is really, really hard. Lots of people don't make it.” I get this now, and I appreciate peoples' candor, but ultimately hearing this repeated over and over is just not helpful in my situation: I am one trying find out how I can succeed.

Anyway, here's how I want this to work: from my research, the following conceptions have developed in my mind. What I need from you is to provide information where my research has been vague, and to confirm or deny the impressions that I have gotten thus far. Here's what I think I know:

+ With regard to actual involvement with games that are produced, the industry is essentially divided into three 	points of the trident:
`````O Artists: I don't think there's really any confusion as to what artists do. It looks like either through ` ` ` ` ````` freelance work or through salaried employment at a company, artists produce work based off of the design ````` documentation created by designers.
`````O Developers: From my research, it seems to me that “developer” is more or less code for “programmer.” ` ````` This could be an oversimplification on my part- that's why I'm asking you guys to help me out.
``````````- Something that is very unclear to me is the level of involvement developers have with design. Are ` `````````` they actively involved in the vision of what their code will eventually implement, or simply ` ` ` ` ` ``````````   construction workers to the game designer's architect status? Somewhere in between?
`````O Designers: While I know that it's an immature idea that such a thing as an “Idea guy” even exists, the ` ```` research doesn't seem to paint designers any other way beyond this vague notion of the architect, the ` ` ````man who decides what the game is going to look and feel like. 
``````````- What is a designer, and is it a sect of this perceived triangle that one can actually market himself ` `````````` as, or does “designer” status simply arise from an artist/developer getting a promotion?
``````````- Why is it that with pretty much every college I check out, the “design” major is either brand new, ` `````````` or at least years and years younger than “Game art” and “Game development”? It almost seems ` ` `````````` sometimes like this isn't a real position.
+ The industry will not hire anyone without a portfolio and/or previous industry (internship, co-op, or full) employment
`````O Thus, I assume that my college of choice needs to have opportunities for workplace experience, and ` `  ````` must heavily involve projects in the curriculum.
+ The indie market is both flourishing and voracious- it's possible to “make it”, but there are huge risks involved.
`````O More than anything else, I think this is where I'd love to work, but is it actually a practical ambition?

Anyway, that's the impression my research has given me. I also have a variety of college-based questions, but before I put those out, I'd like to tell you all a little bit about myself. 

My name is Brendan LoBuglio, and I'm a high school senior living in Bethesda, Maryland. I get mostly A's, and My SAT score is just a bit above 2000 (though I'll test again this October to see if I can get that up a bit). I consider myself a strong student, and am working as the Stage Manager of my High School's drama program. My interest in Gaming is deep, and has its roots in what I refer to simply as “experience”. I don't want to bore you all with my wishy-washy teenage ideals in what I hope to be a practical conversation, but I'll just say that I'm interested in working in the gaming industry because of the medium's potential for deep, immersive atmosphere and it's ability to create lasting memories in players. My favorite games are Pikmin, Earthbound, Cave Story, and many of the titles that Nifflas has put out. With regard to personal experience, I have been developing games in Multimedia Fusion 2 alongside my schoolwork for years, now, and though the work can only be sporadic alongside my so many other things to do, I pride myself on doing a good, thorough job, and I think my latest project, though very simple, has a rather high degree of polish. I've worked with some beta testers and an artist on this one, making it more of a team effort. I've had a bit of programming experience, but beyond some shallow Java work and MMF2 scripting, this is an area of expertise I definitely feel could use improvement. I can't really draw, but I write very well, and can do simple spriting.

I hope this self gives you all an idea of what I'm looking for in a career- though I'm not afraid of doing hard work to attain my vision, I'm more driven by the affective domain of video games, the atmosphere, design logistics and sense of experience, than the cognitive domain- programming and mathematics. Anyway, here is what I'd like to know about college and how it pertains to the gaming industry:

+ In accordance with my confusion regarding game designers and their jobs, is “Game Design” a practical major, or just a scam-out for those who want to pursue the wishy-washy concept of an “idea guy” who doesn't have to work to realize his gaming ambitions?
`````O As someone whose strongest abilities fall further into English and design than they do programing and `  `````art, do I really stand a chance?
+ What are the implications of choosing a liberal arts school over a “tech school” over a vocational school? What are the different experiences I can get from each, and is attending one particularly necessary (or dangerous) if I want to participate in the gaming industry?
`````O In other words, how does it affect me whether I go to a Ringling or an RIT or a Full Sail? Can I get a `   `````serious, practical education in Game design if I attend a university without Digipen's hypernarrow, super in-`````depth focus on the industry?
+ Am I “allowed” to take non-gaming related courses during college if I want a chance in the industry? Would it be practical to major in some Game degree and minor in Biology or sociology, for example? I know these are taboo words to be spoken in the same breath as Digipen, but I do have interests beyond gaming, just like any normal person does.
`````O I've been privvy to two conflicting notions about this: on one hand, a game designer is supposed to draw          `````creatively from widespread interests and experiences in his work, but on the other hand, I've heard bad `   `````things about spreading myself thin when I'm trying to enter such a competitive industry.
+ What are the benefits and hazards of choosing a degree program which directly pertains to gaming? If a prospective college does not have a gaming program, and I wasting my time with it?
+ How seriously should I take gamecareerguide.com, specifically with regard to it's college analysis? What about the Princeton Review's “Top Ten” list?
+ Finally, and very broadly, what are the colleges I should look out for as “not serious”, and which ones are known as the cream of the crop?

So, there it is. To put my questions in a nutshell, I want to know whether “Designer” is a real position, where I can go to be taken seriously, which sources to believe, and whether my education in Gaming needs to be to the exclusion of everything else. As much as I'd love to just enjoy being what I am and who I am right now, a High School student with good friends and a really nice life, I've started to realize that my first “rest of your life” decision is upon me.

I'm currently about to be a 3rd year CE student with a focus on digital hardware. I work my butt off in school, but I'm not the brightest crayon in the box. I spend a lot of time on school to get a decent grade. I also have club activities which I am an officer position for, and I don't plan to leave the club because it has helped me grow as a person. I feel like many times I don't have enough time in the day. But I have a lot of fears regarding my major.

I feel like I have what it takes to graduate as an engineering major, but I'm not sure whether or not I have what it takes in the real world in terms of designing stuff. I just realized I'm a total noob when it comes to hands-on things. My dad is a CE too, although he has an entire different focus. I had a talk with him and he basically said that I suck as an engineer. The differences in thinking between us is at a different level. I take ages to compute and think of a plan while something that I struggle with for days/weeks he can think of within minutes.

I barely have had any hands-on experience, and while my dad has let me play around with his USB module, I have no idea what the hell to do with it. I use LabVIEW and the USB module, although I fail because I have NO IDEA what the hell I'm trying to do. Hell I have a hard time following the LabVIEW tutorials on NI's website.This has also gotten me thinking: Do I really have what it takes to find a job once I get out of college? By 9 months I'm expected to have an internship even though I feel like I don't qualify as an engineer.

As a 3rd year I have barely taken any classes. I took a data structure class which I've almost(entirely) forgotten, my java is rusty and my C which sucked probably sucks even more now. I have taken a computer systems and assembly class, which I liked until we got to assembly. The other class was a logic/digital design class which I LOVED. That class was extremely fun although I had to put a lot of time into it.

Also another problem I have with as a student, I tend to work in groups/partners with other students. I'm not sure whether or not this is a downer, but when I work with somebody else I suddenly become much more efficient/smarter. When I work by myself I tend to get almost everything wrong, as if I doubt my ability to work on something myself. But when I work with somebody else I my doubt suddenly turns into confidence and I know how to approach things smart and efficiently, but when I'm by myself I feel like a lost boy in the woods.

Help me, please?"

**6,670 Pizza connoisseurs for 4 Years!**

I believe that [pizza](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EBkPS5il3sc/TAOt2UOxMpI/AAAAAAAAAEo/m1eklrmOUWA/s1600/macks-pizza.jpg) is the food of gods ..

When was the last time you had the privilege of dining this heavenly piece of soft baked circular bread with the colourful vegetable toppings which [lit up your heart](http://www.aiellospizza.com/pizza-page.jpg) and brought you to ecstasy ? When was the last time you took a slice from a pizza dripping with cheese and actually took a [bite](http://www.baciocheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image-1.jpg) and you could hear its crispness when taking bites indulged and overflowing with its heavenly smell ?

Writing these lines had me craving for a slice :D

In Neapolitan dialect the word ""piza"" was used to mean ""the way of snatching something from the hot oven"". It definitely is worthy of that name isn't it ? :D

The modern pizza was originated as you must have guessed it in the country which prides of the [leaning tower of pisa](http://www.travlang.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pisa_00.jpg), Italy. Pizza is a very famous celebrated dish today. Almost every country has restaurants which serve this delicious dish and accordingly, is prepared very differently in different countries as per the country's tastes! Pizzas come in [various varieties](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9MOB-niqBbI/TKpip35fJtI/AAAAAAAAMNA/gArVkbf_Mzc/s1600/recursivepizza2.jpeg.jpg) depending on the flavours and sizes and recently the restaurants to boost up the sales bring about newer innovative ways to attract pizza lovers like serving in a [cone](http://koshersamurai.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/pizza-cone-1.jpg), baking the bread in [different shapes](http://images.quickblogcast.com/18684-17848/mcpizza2.jpg) and other beautiful ways .. and rest assured each one melts the heart of the customers :')

I have always dreamt of the day when i will be at the top of eiffel tower eating a warm [classic margherita pizza with extra mozarella cheese](http://gwfoodjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pizza-food_C.jpg) accompanied by a lady friend where we are holding each other hands and looking into the stars ... oops i got distracted! :D But then again, pizza is a dish which is an instant mood setter, friend maker, a quarrel nullifier, a family/friends get-together(er)!  Offer a slice of Pizza to a person and he WILL become your friend! I know i will! :D

So i sat down with the mods of /r/pizza to have a cheesy interview with them and they had these things to say!

&gt;##1. What is your favourite pizza ?
&gt;&gt; **pizzatime:** It is proper pizzetiquette for one to say, ""The Pizza Nearest Thou"" in polite company. But, behind closed doors I would tell you as a friend. The #1 (subject to infrequent changes) pizza for me right now is made by my neighbors the Dragoni Family of Pizzeria Dante. On the thin side, amazing crust that is slightly crispy, but properly chewy. Goat cheese, arugula, a splash of balsamic and no sauce

&gt;&gt;A distant runner up was just discovered around the corner and is called the Loaded Baked Potato, you can take that for face value. It's good and guilty, but not Dante.

&gt;&gt;**mrsnakers:**BBQ Chicken or something with lots of Pineapple.

&gt;##2. Do you make pizza ? where did your love for pizza originate from ?
&gt;&gt;**pizzatime:**I do make pizza and this will send ripples down the community, but I have been experimenting with cast iron slabs instead of pizza stones! 

&gt;&gt; I would say around '91 when I was heavy into the Ninja Turles. The trend resurged around 2006 when I actually started eating gourmet pizzas and traveling around writing the word pizza on everything. In 2007 at Bonaroo we turned Pizza into a gang and it was awesome. To be in the gang you have to know your favorite pizza place, remember the best pizza that you ever had, high fives, and don't ever forget to have fun or else you get kicked out until you eat pizza again. It is not a violent gang.

&gt;&gt;**mrsnakers:**I use to make pizzas pretty often but I recently moved into an apartment that has a very bad oven. It burns everything so I stopped using it. Ruined too many good pizzas by burning the edges :&lt;

&gt;&gt;TMNT

&gt;##3. Which is the best pizza you have ever tasted ?
&gt;&gt;**pizzatime:**Best pizza I ever tasted was on the Big Island, Hawaii. It's one of the last meals I remember eating with my Uncle. It also kindled my love for artichoke hearts. It was delicious, but more importantly a good memory.

&gt;&gt;**mrsnakers:**Hard to say. My tastes seem to change quite a lot and I love pizza and I love trying new things. The only way I can really answer this question is by saying something about the best pizza I've had recently which was at a local pizza shop called Pane e Vino. Their ""Mona Lisa"" is amazing but quite different from your traditional pizza. Goat cheese, olive oil, bake pear, arugula. Customized with additional Pineapple and chicken. It was baller to say the least.

&gt;##4. Do you have something to say to your readers and your future readers ?
&gt;&gt;**pizzatime:**I've been waiting for a proper forum for this for a while. I sat through the whole bacon craze for 5 years thinking that something was being seriously over looked. Sure, it was comedic, bacon tastes good...but why are we glorifying ONE ingredient when Pizza could have bacon crust, bacon fried cheese curds, pancetta simultaneously, etc.

&gt;&gt;Anyway, now that it's all faded and I really see Pizza picking up steam as a super food. It's a primordial birthright. A simple dough and ingredients that are available to you. It's all very human.

&gt;&gt;**mrsnakers:**Stay golden.

Happy dining and a happy tuesday! :D

102aru,2,2012-09-18,Help with Letter of Resignation,redsight,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/102aru/help_with_letter_of_resignation/,"Hello fellow accounting nuts,

I currently work at an accounting firm as a lower-level tax staff manager. I have worked there for approx. 1 year and have worked my way from intern, to tax staff, to lower tax staff manager. 

Now, my firm in the past 18 months has had a very high turn over ratio of employees. As in: 4 CPAs have left, 3 experiences tax staff have left, and they have hired no one but inexperienced interns to fill the gap.

This means that they are planning on relying a lot on me, one other tax staff member in the same position I am in, and three younger CPAs that are also considered managers. 

I have come across an opportunity that I cannot pass up and I will be putting in my 2 week notice on October 12th. I know that the day I tender my resignation they will just ask me to leave and not stay for the two weeks (this has happened with every employee that has left so far). I also know that they will act and sound some offended and not be very civil (this too has happened in the past). 

I want to be professional and let them know they I have enjoyed my time there, but I know they feel like they have invested a lot into me and will not take the resignation very well. 

How do I resign? Straight to the HR person, face to face with the managing partner (we talk casually often)? A simple e-mail to the HR person? Paper?

102a6s,13,2012-09-18,I constantly think about how I want to die.,doctor_haus,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/102a6s/i_constantly_think_about_how_i_want_to_die/,"I'm not suicidal. I am not going to kill myself.

I am selfish and I often feel like I want to die. 

Not sure whether it's because of how I was brought up or just something I decided somewhere along the line but to me suicide is quitting. I don't see myself as a quitter and I don't see giving up as an option. I also know how much it would hurt the people that I love and that love me, even if I don't always feel loved. Suicide is selfish.

So I think about dying in ways that I can't control. I sometimes wish that I would be in a bank or store when a gunman comes in. I tragically wished I was in the theater in Aurora that was shot up... I could have died protecting someone I love. When I'm driving I wish someone would crash into me. You get the point.

I don't know why I feel like this. I just do. Living and moving through day to day is painful for me. I suppose it is relevant that I have been going through a breakup that's taking a toll on me to the point of sleeplessness. We dated for just over two years. I got an internship out of state for the summer and she had to stay here. A break turned into a breakup. Now I'm home and she doesn't want to get back together. She wants to ""be single"" and not have to worry about anyone else. I know her well enough to know she isn't sleeping around.

And here's the thing. I feel deep down that we're going to be together. We still get along reasonably well but if you ask her, we aren't getting back together. If you ask me, I feel like we will get back together and I feel like we're going to be together for the rest of our lives and I feel like we will be happy. 

Honestly, I have never believed anything so whole heartedly in my life. I can't explain it, but it's how I feel.

That said, I still feel like everyday lasts an eternity. I feel alone all the time. Every moment is just agonizing. I had issues with depression when I was younger and it's something that flares up here and there. It really flared up when I was gone for the summer. About a week into it, I just felt very alone. I was living with strangers, renting a room. I didn't know anyone in the city where I was living. I made a bunch of friends and spent time with them, but it felt fake. It felt wrong. I just felt alone all the time.

I just don't know what to do and I don't know who to say this to. Maybe someone has the right words..."

**I need your help to build a better model of education!**

I've been working for almost 10 years in urban education and for the last five, I've been designing a different model of education (mostly stolen bits from other models).  But I continue to run into difficulties in how to go forward. I know a room full of brains is better than one, and I am hoping the same is true here.

**The problems**  

-how do I start a new school on entirely different model without hurting traditional public schools?  
-how do I go about getting it approved?  
-how do I get the word out and students?  
-how do I get teachers to be willing to come work there?  
-what other problems are there that I am missing?  


**The Model** (for those who are interested a brief overview)  

* no grades or grade levels  
* no discrete classes only subject matter experts (teachers)  
* students are organized into learning groups (flexible and later student-determined)  
* students determine projects they are interested in  
* guiding teacher connects subject matter components to project  
* subject matter components have computerized competency tests student must pass before completing project   
* The school and teachers focus more on modeling, teaching, and cultivating  
critical thinking, collaboration, innovation, problem-solving, etc. rather than subject matter expertise.  
* The school has an ""admin"" but they are more of a facilitator who helps to implement the vision and decision of the teachers there  
* The school is limited to 120 students  
* 1 ""admin"" and 10 teachers  
* Real-world internships for students are mandatory

",Kelso22340,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/102256/introduction_and_an_explanation_of_my_current/,"I wanted to start by saying that I've been lurking here for quite some time and I have been inspired and amazed at some of all of your awesome progress. Seriously, as someone who has struggled with weight issues ( a lot being psychological ) I am brought to tears some times with how great some of you have improved your lives. 


I have dealt with feeling over weight for most of my life. Not seriously over weight.. but enough to make me uncomfortable in my own skin. I guess that all started around 4th grade. But, it took me until middle school to have an absolute melt down. I remember getting back my school pictures in the beginning of 6th grade and literally running to my moms car crying. I also hadn't grown into my adult teeth yet and I was convinced I looked like a fat bever. I begged my Mom to help me lose weight. She gave me tips and I joined every sports team that was offered to me. This is what I consider my eating disorder phase of my life. I became so obsessed with what I ate, I even got mad at others for eating things I couldn't around me. Thinking back on it now, it's sad to think that 12 year old me was that unhappy and obsessed. But, I lost all my chubby adolescent weight and grew out of my obsessive food issues by high school (no I was never actually diagnosed or taken to doctors, but now when this part of my life comes up my mother has said that she thinks she probably should have taken me to see someone). I went through the rest of high school as a normal teenager... not over weight but not skinny...[this](http://i.imgur.com/h2WgC.jpg) is probably the thinnest I was in HS ...around 16...looking back on the pictures now I can see how I gradually gained weight up till my [senior year](http://i.imgur.com/4NcxQ.jpg) Throughout high school I was a consistant 145-150lb ( I am 5'4)  ... I played varsity lacrosse and ice hockey... and RUINED my ankle. My senior year of high school, I went through physical therapy hoping that would fix my  ankle... but alas I was told I needed constructive surgery. 


My freshman year of college, I started out on the lacrosse team....but over christmas vacation [This](http://i.imgur.com/0ZSBa.jpg) happened. I didn't realize how little I would be able to do after surgery. I had to get rides to class... became very lazy... started smoking..quit working out...but continued to eat like an athlete.. and before I knew it I hated myself. I wouldn't look at myself in the mirror after getting out of the shower and I would never consider weighing myself. I talked myself into thinking that clothing stores had changed their sizes and that their cloths didn't fit real people anymore. I couldn't wrap my head around that I didn't fit into any of my cloths anymore... I seriously just couldn't grasp it. It took till the end of my sophomore year of college,[picture](http://i.imgur.com/6Q81J.jpg) and another [picture](http://i.imgur.com/3gI5O.jpg),when my lacrosse coach told me that I either needed to drop 30+ pounds or just not bother coming back to the team. Well... most people would say screw you and walk off the team... but after realization that I needed to weigh myself and that I really did want to play on the team and get back in shape.... I cried a lot and then decided to get on the scale. Mind you the last time I had weighed myself I was 145...and in my head.. thats what I still was. But I got on to find I weighed 170lb... and on my 5'4 frame....thats a lot to have gained. Especially considering I thought in my head I was still in shape.... So I joined the TEAM weight loss group at my local life time fitness and the whole summer of 09' I spent working out at 5am and watching everything that went in my mouth. In august before I went back to school. I had [lost 25lb](http://i.imgur.com/PyAlB.jpg)and was hoping that my friends at college would know how much effort I had made. Well, my team mates... and my room mates definitely noticed. I'll never forget how awesome it felt when I showed up at my apartment and my room mate opened the door and yelled... WOAH WHERE IS THE REST OF YOU. Unfortunately my coach didn't acknowledge my weight loss... but he didn't kick me off the team either...it felt great when all of my team was congratulating me in front of him. I don't think he really expected me to man up and do it. I played lax for the last two years of college and we had our own problems butting heads over other issues... I was always the team emotional punching bag for my coach. 

My weight fluctuated a little bit my last two years of college.. but not a bit to really make a difference... but now that I've been off living in different states for my internships... and not on a sports team... I am having a very hard time maintaining and losing the extra weight I put on after college. I moved to atlanta last fall and made a ton of friends... went out all the time... drank and started smoking again.. so of course I gained weight. I moved to connecticut last winter.... had no friends... became depressed... worked out constantly but I didn't eat enough... So I didn't lose weight then either.. I went up from 147 to 157 this past summer and am devastated... I am now living in savannah GA... and I joined a gym and havent smoked since last year... but I am again having a hard time losing weight... I have tried cutting calories... and that will work for an extent... but I am unable to get under 150. I have been working on a lot of heart rate training lately... getting my heart up to my max HR... letting it come down and getting it back up again.  I am sick of just feeling alright about my weight and I want to get the extra 15lbs off that I was unable to get off when I lost weight in college... I figure that if I post my situation here that I will hold myself accountable some how that other people know what I am trying to do. I joined a soccer team here as well trying to get some more exercise in ( Ive NEVER played soccer before in my life!)... but if anyone has any help with plateaus I am more then open to it. 

This is me [now](http://i.imgur.com/pibqf.jpg)
5'4 153lb 22 years old
and I am stuck. 
I know I don't have any huge loss to brag about and I feel like I look whiney in this post. But I figured if anyone knows about how to lose that last 15... its ya'll. 

Thank you for all your inspiration and positive encouragement loseit!

We had an unbelievable amount of commonalities; love to exercise, biology majors, identical fall schedules at the same school, similar interests, we even both live with our grandparents while in school! The list goes on. We went on a few dates but I didn't detect interest on her end, so I dropped contact and forgot about it. 

She texted me a couple weeks later, and a couple weeks after that, and I started thinking that maybe I was wrong and that she was actually interested. But then she left for the summer on an internship, only to contact me as soon as she was back in town, and a few more times in the days leading into the fall semester. 

Fast forward 5 weeks later, we spend almost all day, every day together in our classes, I've been in a cast so she gives me rides to school and to the gym, where we workout together. And when we aren't together we are texting each other. I'd had a girlfriend that I'd been dating almost 4 months, but broke up with her a couple weeks ago because I realized I felt so much more strongly about this girl. She is not that big of a flirt (she's acts a bit like one of the guys) but the signals were impossible to miss, even for my socially inept ass. 

So I finally ask her on a date, and she says yes, only to contact me the day of the date to say:

*""So I've been, for lack of a better term, in a long distance relationship with this guy that's in the navy for a while. It's a really weird situation, but I wanted to establish where you and I stand I guess. I have so much fun with you, and I think you're really attractive and you're smart which makes you even more attractive, but I'm worried that if I start spending more time with you I'm gonna end up in a position that I don't want to be in. If you would still like to go to dinner tonight, I will pay for myself. If not, I totally understand. I have been struggling with this since you asked me because I hate hurting people's feelings, but I don't want to lead you on/end up giving myself a reason to stay in [city] when I really don't want to be here after next semester""*

And after my reply, another:

*""I'm sorry. I really do feel awful, but I can't put myself in a position where there's a possibility of me liking you more than I do now, and it's more than I should anyway. Thank you for being cool about this. I'm sorry I didn't say something earlier.""*

I should mention, that I actually am exceptionally good looking (I know lots of people think this, but trust me), and a pretty good catch overall (if I do say so myself) and I've become quite used to winning over any girl I choose. But although I have dated my share of women, I don't date as often as people assume I would. I'm pretty picky to be honest. I'm either not attracted to the women that I share interests with, or find the attractive girls dull or too interested in partying. So to find such a match was astounding.

Suffice it to say, this rejection pretty much crushed me. I'm not a very emotional person and typically handle rejection easily, but I've never cared this much before. And to make things more difficult, I still receive rides from her each day, and we're still lab partners in class, and she seems content to be friends and continue on as normal.

But I dont know that I can do that, I feel more strongly about her than I have towards any of my long relationships even, and it kills me to be around her now. If you've read this far, I simply want advice as whether it seems worth pursuing her, as I believe she may have really been torn about this decision herself, or whether I should forget it and move on, like I usually would when finding out about a girl's relationship.

I am a beginning video editor and what I want to ultimately do is the visual/picture editing portion. I believe sound is important, as it is also part of video editing, and to understand it better I'm taking a sound design class. Through this, I met a sound editor from a major studio who offered me an internship at his own studio.


Of course my initial thought was, ""Heck yea!"" But now I'm not sure if I would be doing the right thing. Part of me thinks it would be good to get a well-rounded foundation of video editing, both in visual and sound. I barely know Pro Tools and it wouldn't hurt to have him teach me more in depth. However, I've already wasted time getting an unrelated degree and am worried that it will just lead me to continue doing sound (I have a couple other sound contacts at other major studios) when what I'm actually good at and want to do is visuals.


-Do you think it would truly help me and that it will only make me a stronger video editing candidate in my job search later on to say that I know both FCP and Pro Tools?

-Or do you think having that in my resume would land me mostly opportunities in sound and I should focus more on what I specifically want to do?


Of course I am grateful for the opportunity. I'm just afraid to go down the wrong path again &amp; it's very hard to turn down help from editors at big studios.

105wfg,3,2012-09-19,"[22/m] Temporarily moved back in with emotionally negligent parents, feelings of past resentment resurfacing. How do I make the best of things before I leave again?",file13bin,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/105wfg/22m_temporarily_moved_back_in_with_emotionally/,"Hello Reddit, using a throwaway for this one because it’s pretty personal for me.  This will probably be a little long &amp; read like I’m on a therapist’s couch, so I apologize in advance. :(

I am 22 year old male that will be graduating in December &amp; has plans to move to the other side of the United States to start fresh with my life.  For the last 4 years, I have lived on an urban college campus, attending university. I just moved in with my parents (to save up money for the move) for my final semester &amp; am currently running into issues that I’m afraid will escalate if I don’t figure out how to manage them. 

Let me elaborate. 

I grew up an only child &amp; a latch key kid in a small town– my parents were always working and I would spend hours upon hours alone at my home. On the upside, this molded my into a very independent person. I later grew to realize my parents are very superficial people who hide their personal or emotional issues from others (even each other).  My father is emotionally negligent &amp; controlling (I think he may have some sort of OCD) while my mother grew up very sheltered &amp; is superficial/unable to accept that she's capable of any wrongdoing  (think similar to ‘sheltered suburban housewife’ meme - yeah).  This made for a very lonely upbringing where my emotional problems were rarely consoled by my parents.  I harbored resentment towards my father, as he always made me feel like I wasn’t good enough.  My mother seemed so submissive &amp; self-centered that she didn’t do much to help the situation &amp; I didn’t know what to do besides just swallow my emotions.  I never acted out, never revolted against my parents - I harnessed my resentment through the arts and became a relatively successful musician in the closest metro music scene. I did very well in high school, graduated with honors, &amp; coped with the loneliness… until I fell into depression in college.

My band that I had dedicated my teenage life towards broke up, I lost a lot of friends, got involved in a toxic two-year relationship, &amp; found myself popping in &amp; out of therapists/psychologists offices for a whole year.  I was diagnosed with chronic depression, severe social anxiety, ADHD – got put on &amp; off medications, lost interest in almost everything in my life, college GPA plummeted, confusion &amp; anxiety happened on almost a daily basis. I was going to drop out.

Then I got a surprise scholarship to study abroad &amp; spent a good portion of this last summer overseas in many foreign countries.  It was a breath of fresh air &amp; the best thing that has ever happened to me. I got back in touch with who I really am, stopped taking my meds, made new friends, and did well in my classes. I felt like my life had somehow escaped a car crash &amp; I had a whole newfound appreciation for everything.  I felt free to live my life, rather than be haunted &amp; held down by past experiences.

Now here I am, Reddit, in my final semester in college – staying healthy, working out, working a job &amp; internship, &amp; trying to stay focused on my studies.  But I feel like I’m starting to become undone again. It’s difficult with this living situation, I find myself slipping back into the person that I was before I left overseas – depressed, anxious, easily irritated, overwhelmed.  I’ve talked about my previous issues with my parents (Finally addressing the loneliness of growing up) &amp; I can tell they somehow, in someway, empathize with me – but I can’t help but feel they transformed my bad situation into OUR bad situation &amp; now they feel bad for themselves for not being “good parents” so it turned into a pity party.  And I don’t want them to feel that way.  But it does makes me angry that I feel lonely again in a situation where I reached out to them &amp; didn’t get anything of substance in return.  They just don’t know how to address my issues, which I don’t expect them to – but they also don’t really TRY to address them either.

I’m tired of feeling lonely but I don’t want this to escalate into something more – that’s the last thing I want before I move away.  Despite the resentment, I want to leave on good terms – I regret when I act out due to suppressed anger.  I don’t attempt to try and make them understand much anymore because I think we may never see eye to eye, and that’s probably my fault for staying silent so many years – they just don’t understand how much of an emotional toll it took on me. 

I feel like maybe I haven’t thought about the right way to go about things &amp; there is a way I can get through to my parents that I haven’t though of…? Am I doing something wrong? Or are my parents really just negligent towards emotional issues? If I can’t get through to them, should I just avoid being at the house as much as possible to avoid any issues? 

I need you’re advice, Reddit!  It’s only a 4 months or so until I’m out of this, but it’s a big turning point in my life &amp; I don’t want to regret anything before I leave them! 



**TLDR: Grew up with emotionally negligent parents, went to college &amp; became a sadass w/ depression, went overseas &amp; perked my happyass back up.  Now temporarily living at home again &amp; my happyass is starting to droop into a sadass again. Don't want to blast ass all over my parents before I leave. What do?**



Edit: Wow. That was really long. So I gave it a TLDR. Sorry.

I'm hoping that no PMO along with giving up my internet connection at home (still can access internet on my phone for emergencies) will make a difference.

- How important are grades versus all the rest?  Have any of you been accepted while having a strong application but lacking outstanding grades?

- Do you have any advice when reaching out (through e-mail) to a professor who has research interests that line up with mine?  Just how important is this?

Last week I have been playing a little WvW on our Eternal Battlegrounds before I went to my internship in the morning (GMT+1 around 6:30 that is, I live in the Netherlands). Every time I've ran into a group who had the ability to make strategic decisions and pulled it off to conquer objective after objective. We did not split up (every now and then I left the group with 1-2 others to kill a sentry and cap a point and join the group afterwards), we did invest in siege equipment, we had good communication going. One dude build a siege golem at a supply camp two days ago. Got called out in chat, the group came over to help getting it build and we marched to battle with myself and some others keeping swiftness up. In other words: a group who did get things done. I really enjoyed being a part of it a few days in a row.


It crossed my mind I actually regret I dont know who build the siege golem. I dont know the guys who build it up in a matter of seconds a supply camp. I dont know the people who talked about different strategies and came to a consensus and went to battle with a great frontline, while dodging a zerg of another server who greatly outnumbered us (Xaoc or something?).


I believe some of those people are there every morning and I also believe they are fanatic WvW'ers, not held together by a guild but by a passion for WvW. I would like to get in touch with these people, march to battle with them more frequently. So my toughts: why not make a guild for those morning-WvW'ers on Gandara who roam the Eternal Battlegrounds in the early morning like a boss? Ofcourse we all have our own guils, friends and social contacts in this wonderful MMO. But at times we can represent other guilds you know. Every morning there are a bunch of great players with the same goal. I believe their efforts would be even more effective in a guild who spends influence at upgrades that benefit WvW warfare, coördinates even more, gets to know eachother and eventually might grow in numbers.

Are there any people who second this feeling? Honestly, it has been my greatest WvW experience so far and I would love to get in touch with those people more. I am wondering if other people on my server are experiencing the same.

[I am not even sure if this is a recruitment post or not, I just wanted to ventilate my toughts. I've had great times and if people are interested this might be the start of a great WvW guild on Gandara. If I was supposed to post this somewhere else, I apologize.]

While in college I have used a wide variety of other languages though, which I created a few small to medium academic projects in. These languages were C#, Python and Java. Now this was a few months to a year ago. So I have used these languages before, and could easily read their syntax. However, I would not feel comfortable writing code in them by memory or answering specific language interview questions. Is it wrong to list these languages as a skill? Should my resume only contain the languages I know strongly or all the ones I've technically worked with before?

As someone newer to the industry I guess I feel like with just C and a few other things listed in my skills section it would seem pretty empty. But on the other hand I would hate to list all the languages I've worked with but am not up to date with and get grilled in an interview. 

Ideally it would be nice to find a job in C, and I will be applying to these jobs. But, would I be perceived as having a narrow skill set with only C listed as a programming language skill?

It's the Multicultural Advertising Internship Program. Pretty much, you apply for your position (pretty much any position in advertising) you do a lot of work for the application, if you're applying to be a creative you need to have a portfolio (mine was terrible, don't let it stop you) and do a campaign for them. (the rules may have changed since I was in it)


If you get through the semi-finals and finals and all that, they'll give your name out to a lot of big agencies mostly in New york, but also in Chicago and San Fran and a couple other places and they pick you from a list. I could be wrong, but a lot of big agencies here always pick at least one or two interns from this pool. When I interned, my agency picked about 6 of us from this list.


My partner and I were hired on full time after our internship and I attribute it directly to MAIP. I wouldn't have had a chance without them. It's an amazing program. I can't talk it up enough.


If you have any questions about it, let me know. I'll try to answer them for you. But seriously, If you qualify, and you have no earthly idea how you can make your way to a great agency in a great city, you really should apply. It absolutely changed my life. I wouldn't be here if I didn't apply.


Good luck, folks.

Here's what I was thinking of alst night

&gt; You're waiting at your desk. Its been 15 minutes since you emailed your boss and you hope you don't have to stay back much longer. I just sent you a pic of me in nothing but your favorite stockings and your mind is really racing. You wish you could just finish the damn document and rush home because you know I'm waiting. So eagerly waiting. You look around the office. And sigh ... Its just you and that intern, and he's also about to head home. You are lost in thoughts, when suddenly, you whiff a rather familiar scent. It smells like my favorite perfume, but how? You can't imagine I could possibly have snuck in, but then you remember there's a spare key at home. And you turn around, and let out a laugh of excitement.


&gt; ""Shhh .."" I step forward and place a finger on your lips. ""You might startle the intern."" You stay silent. But your eyes are wide and wondering. What on earth am I doing here. You only then have the time to look me up and down and you see a little nipple poking through my dress. I'm not wearing a bra. Even better, I'm not wearing any underwear. I smile as I take your hand up my skirt slowly and I let you play with my thighs and my lips. You can feel the warmth and how they're starting to get slick. You can't help but put a finger in and I stifle a moan. But I arch my back in pleasure as the light casts a wonderful shadow on my dress showing off my curves.
I bend down and sit kneeling at your chair. I'm almost out of sight from the intern, hidden by the big file cabinet. You look around, almost expecting trouble, but instead you hear your zipper getting unzipped. You mouth ""are you serious?"" as I can feel your bulge growing in excitement and fear. I nod my head. I start to twirl my tongue on the tip of your cock and taste that lovely precum. Oh my, there seems to be an awful lot today. Very tasty and slick. Looks like the excitement's getting to you. Looks like the excitement is getting to me too. I gently suck on the tip as your expression remains wide-eyed. I love it. ""Let's wait for that email, shall we?"" I whisper as I take your cock down my mouth ...



How would you continue it? :P"

This affects all aspects of my life...fml

It's empowering to know, but when I first realized this I felt like I got bricked in the face and trying to break the cycle I decided not to be hard on myself...

Anyways, the specific situation is that I joined a start up in February (I was jobless at the time) to learn and build my portfolio and started working a very demanding job a few months in.

At first, I was supposed to write content but now my boss has marketing and I'm not sure with the stress of my new job that I can continue..

I need to have 'the talk' to tell her how much I can handle. She's trying to grow her business and I don't want to just walk away but she's also become a friend and I feel bad that I can't handle both my day gig and this.

Also, at the start she said I'd have the freedom to do what I want with no mention of deadlines or specific goals so it seemed easy to handle given other commitments. Now I have other folks she's hired assigning me laundry lists of 'action items' for this unpaid gig.

How do you quit a job or internship without feeling bad about it? Especially if it's a friend? How do you determine it's just too much for you? The hardest part was realizing I'm just spreading myself too thin.."
104x37,1,2012-09-19,Is college worth it?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/104x37/is_college_worth_it/,"I am a freshmen who entered college not five weeks ago, declared in computer science.  My college experience so far has really disillusioned me towards an institution that, growing up was just assumed as the next logical step in any well-off teenager's life after high-school.  And I am well off.  My parents have always placed education highly, putting money into a state plan to allow me to enroll wherever I choose (in state, of course). On top of the other state-awarded scholarships, my decision to go to the college I'm currently at was heavily influenced by a full tuition paid scholarship, that came with a subsequent internship in my field.  The only point I'm trying to make here is money shouldn't really be an issue I'm worried about, in the sense of student loans or running my parents bankrupt.  But money is one of the primary reasons I'm considering quitting.

I think everyone agrees, to an extent, college is a bit of a rip-off.  We generally go along with it due to it being a pre-requisite to most higher paying jobs, etc, etc (you're all pretty smart, I don't need to tell you what you already know). But if I don't want those higher paying jobs, as my experience with my internship suggests, why bother? Throughout my entire high school career I did intern at the local university, developing software in a very relaxed environment, and enjoyed it greatly, but this cynical fast-paced ""enterprise""-ridden job I currently hold is ruining my love of computers. That's not how I want it to be. And to be clear, I understand not all companies are like that, but just by my nature I'd rather learn and grow in the subject on my own time, at my own pace.

So, barring you haven't stopped reading after deciding this is just ""another stuffy college student complaining about nothing"" (and I wouldn't blame you), this is the plan I see for myself:

* Probably call my parents today, and tell them that I am at least having some doubt about college.  I'll fill them in on any quick worries they might have, but mainly just so it's not a full shock when they come down in two weeks when we can discuss it more.  Such worries might include:
	* Will I finish the semester? Yes.
	* Depending on how much we've already put down on housing deposits on the next semester, will I stay for that one too if needed? Yes.
	* Am I depressed? No.
	* Is it because I'm having trouble with my classes? No.
	* Is it because I'm not meeting enough new people? No.
	* Is it because my dog just died? No.
	
* Continue to mull this over and give it a lot of thought. 
* Discuss it more with my parents at length when they come for parents weekend.  Most likely I'll suggest (to hopefully ease their worries) that I'll just take a semester off as a trial run, something to that effect, not to completely rule out returning.
* Move back home at the end of the semester, and quickly find a job.  I want to be independent, so I'll do lots of extra chores around the house until I can pay some form of rent, and slowly ween my self off their dependence (phone bill, car insurance, health insurance) and eventually find a place of my own.

Basically that's it. That's my plan.  And while I have a few other things to clarify, it's probably a good time to ask my actual questions: how much of this sounds like bullshit?  Does this seem like a bad idea? Should I just ""man up"" and deal with the stresses of collegiate life like everyone else? Also, as financial security is always a concern, should I just bite the bullet for that reason alone? Give me your wisdom, Reddit (anything else about the situation I've left out or you think would be helpful, just ask).

And finally some other things that could factor in to your answer(s):

* I generally have a good deal of anxiety over things, whether it be tests, work, or something else unless I have 100% confidence in myself I know what I am doing.  This is another reason I think ""college-level"" jobs my not be for me, at least for the time being.  I'd rather work at something I can do very very well (food services, for instance) and be happy.
* I'm a very frugal person, and already live very minimally (yes, I know this is easy to say as a college student, so feel free to call me on this if you think it's an important point to emphasize), so the wages of the jobs I'm looking for should suffice my lifestyle needs.
* Adding onto the last point, I've always saved half of of what I've earned (at my father's behest), so I have about $6000 in the bank.  While I may not be able to add a full half my salary at the wages I'd be making, I'd say that's a pretty strong security net for a nineteen year old.  

**TLDR:** Not happy with college, would rather be happy.

[If you had only primitive weapons, and had to fight a dinosaur to the death in a ""Dinosaur Death Match"", what is the biggest dinosaur you think you could defeat?

Then I would stick it with a sharp stick through its blinded eyes into its brain and win.

On a side note:  [i really enjoy this version of this song by him](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P3_8ifqZlM)

[How do you go about making your beats?  Specifically, do you have a specific technique that you use when you start out with a track to make you able to finish it? I usually have problems finishing a started project when I produce.    Was it hard breaking into the music industry? How did you go by making it to the top?    Any rapper you've worked with who was nothing like the person they try to portray themselves in their songs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3k6b?context=5)|Far as making the beats: i usually start off with melody, then do the drums, layout, hook, start a mix. and then leave it alone till the next day and work on the mix again, and minor tweaks untill im satisfied with it.  I was fortunate enough to be invited into the Anno Domini collective a while back.  Lots of super talented producers with varying styles that compliment each other.  From here I was able to help produce for many different artists.  Then I joined Shadowville and things really took off.  . Its not a piece of cake, but if you work hard, stay focused -  time just passes by, one thing happens after the next and all the sudden u look around and you're in there with the majors...  As far as artists who are not true to their rhymes... :)  theres many... but personality wise I found almost all the artists Ive worked with to be pretty grounded.
[Do you feel hip hop has changed drastically since the days of Tupac and Biggie. And if so, for the better or worse? I know many people who feel its gotten worse.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3i9b?context=5)|Great question.  I wont say that the current state of hiphop sucks.  Its evolving.  I do sometimes feel as though you have to dig slightly deeper to find the gems.  I miss Pac and Big a lot - On a sideways thought, I recently remixed a 2PAC song but because of copy-write laws here in Germany i cant seem to get it uploaded.  Bummin'

The track features Method Man and is amazing.  Hopefully I can get a video for in the next couple of months. As far as stuff that I have released I really like the new Choo Biggz stuff.  Ive given him some good beats and he has put that NY sound over them really well.  So probably ""Pay Homage"" by Choo.

Kept trying to make moves, and trying to myself in THAT position. So many people quit after the first time they get shot down.  Its probably 20 to 30 rejections before the first bit of recognition or appreciation.  Thats not even a big bit.  Then snowballs slowly into something bigger.  Sure, things will happen on their own, but you have to set up the scenario for that shit to happen. if that makes sense?. Being good at what you do is important of course, but what you do with your talent is even more important.  Lots of unrefined talent in this world. Sure a slight bit of luck plays a role but you have to work to give yourself something to start with.  My big break was really getting hooked up with the guys at Anno Domini and we started building together.  Also Shadowville has helped lots of aspiring rappers discover my beats.  I didnt do it all myself.  Tell your friend who makes beats to keep doing that...  maybe someday he'll look down and see a lil golden nugget in his pan.  Thanks for the question.

I understand about C/O Rick Ross and that controversy - and the taking of the name of Freeway Ricky Ross etc. I dont think he was unoriginal as much as paying homage when he picked that name.   However, Rick Ross can still put out good music in my ears. His lyrics are ehhh quite often but his beats are bangin'.  I try to avoid being a hater.  Also a lot of the thug stuff you mention is rooted in the fact that music is an ENTERTAINMENT industry... A lot of stuff is fake. I dont know ross personaly, i dont know how real or fake he is. I enjoy working most with people that are real with their rhymes (hard to find though). i dont want to bash rick ross or anybody for that matter. Still i do prefer people who put truth into rhymes.  Thanks for the question.

[When it comes to making music, how much of the creativity is from the artist, and how much is from you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3ia4?context=5)|My creativity really comes out when I am alone and working on the beat.  Its kind of something I build until I am happy with it.  From there it is up to the artist to continue to build.  Sometimes I have to accomidate X number of bars that an artist wants - or mix something up but usually when an artist gets a beat from me my work is 90% done.  
[When you send a beat to a producer is it structured for verses/choruses? Does the artist specify this? I'm interested in producing  and I've never thought of how this works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4ag7?context=5)|Seems online the standard popular beat seems to be 2 or 3 verses of 16 bars with a chorus.  Artists request this to be mixed up sometimes if what they have written needs accommodating. So yah the artist can specify.  I suggest you give producing a try... it turned from a hobby into work for me.

Lil Wayne and his group of friends are successful at what they do. I dont have room to speak on him as I dont listen to his stuff if I can manage.

[If you could work with any artist and/or producer, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3ycg?context=5)|Rza.
[What midi controller(s\) do you use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a559f?context=5)|Midi is a CME UF60 right now.
[Is sampling ""copyright infringement""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a559f?context=5)|Of course sampling is a part of hiphop.  It can be infringement though for sure.  Getting clearance for a sample can be expensive and difficult and I can see sampling something for a mixtape or something - but to just jack entire parts of tracks ie Vanilla Ice on David Bowie  - I think theres a line there thats actually pretty clear when you look at it.
[What about when it's fantastic, like Frank Ocean using the whole instrumental from Hotel California for his song American Wedding? I'd think more people would fight for Vanilla Ice if he was actually good like FO.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7lou?context=5)|You might be right.  I think Frank Ocean ripped almost the entire song though without the lyrics if Im not mistaken.  that's cool if you're not going to sell it on itunes or make any money on it.  If its for the love of the art then no problem but making money on others people work without them being compensated I think is where the problem was with FO.
[Whole song, no lyrics. On a mixtape (Nostalgia/Ultra\), no money made, yet The Eagles are trying to sue the shit out of FO. I can almost guarantee it was just for the love of the art, and it's ridiculous to sue over what could be considered an homage to a legendary band.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7qzl?context=5)|Yah we let people use our beats for mixtapes for free as long as they dont make money on it.  As soon as they are making money on it we would like to be compensated for our contribution just like any other business.  If its for the love of the art and not for sale on itunes I dont see the issue.
[What are your thoughts on rappers like Childish Gambino? and what do you think of the way he cooperates with the guy who makes his beats wirh him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6xw5?context=5)|Donald Glover is super talented.  Acts well, raps well... my only slight criticism would be his sometimes shallow content. Too many references to his dick I think it was that bothered me.  His videos are good too... he has a lot of resources to work with.  
[Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3f78?context=5)|I watched the video.  It was decent.  Reminds me of Pitbull for some reason.
[Do you think rap is better or worse now compared to the '90s?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4ybc?context=5)|There is something about the 90s hiphop that was real and raw... it was new.  Fresh off the shelf.  It was original.  There seems to be slightly more rehashed product out there.  I try not to hate... I try not to say ""hiphop these days.""  But yes I think maybe because a lot of what went on with hiphop in the 90s was happening for the first time and it felt really alive and sometimes I do feel current day music in general is flooded with redundant mediocre stuff.  There was lots of mediocre stuff in the 90s too.  :)  Its a toss up.
[I tend to stay away from mainstream rap because, its generally shit. Whats your favorite song of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5yix?context=5)|In The Mood by Glenn Miller.
[What tune has not yet been sampled that you really think *should* be sampled?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5377?context=5)|I have always really loved the song by Sam Cooke called A Change is Going to Come and Ive been waiting to hear a good track with a sample from it.
[Link to www.youtube.com Maybe the beat wasn't flipped the best but still a nice tune, good singing from D haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5nhj?context=5)|Damn lol.  Nice find!  Thanks for diggin' that up.  Back in 1998 i was listening to a ton of DMX.  SMH at his lyrics. ""Kind of like a bitch with an erection"" - def would have rather heard something similar to slippin' over that beat.
[Check out this Irish hip hop song let me know what you think.  Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5p6i?context=5)|That is not bad at all.  That beat is dope... reminds me of Guru's old beats that Premiere put together.  That rapper can spit too.
[Have you heard of Flosstradamus or baauer?  What do you think about the cross over of electronic music and trap? (personally, i think its awesome\)  With the explosion of electronic music in nearly every genre, would you ever try to incorporate electronic music into your own sound?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a88tu?context=5)|Nope just looked up Flosstradaumus.  Interesting stuff.  I love when people push boundaries and electronic music as a whole is doing just that.  A couple producers over here at Anno Domini have messed a little with the electronic vibe.  I personally have not... who knows in the future though :)  I might give it a try someday.
[Where can I find more of your personal work?  I really dig the ""swallow the razor"" beat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aaliu?context=5)|Thanks a lot for the listen.  Check out some of the stuff Ive done as a side project.  [""The Unbeatables""](http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=963114)
[Got a book recommendation? And, need an intern, I'm local?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5sho?context=5)|The Little Prince.  Im not looking for an intern right now :)  Thanks. Book recommendation for me?
[Hi, i have a freind named austin who wants to be a rapper, i was wondering if you could check out some of his stuff and i could pass on anything you have to say, here is his youtube link.  (Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ai5zv?context=5)|Whattup.  I checked that stuff.  He's a youngster still and will grow.  He sounds like he trying to emulate wayne.  You should get him to listen to some Brother Ali or something with more emotion in it.  His rhymes are decent but lacking emotion.  Sometimes switchin up the content to something a little more heartfelt can bring that out.  Im not saying to rap like a pussy but Im saying suggest to him to think about widening his range.  The best part about this kid is he is decent and so young - so as he gets older his flow gunna tighten up and his experiences going to color his rhymes a little more.  I respect the effort it takes to do what hes doing.  Send him my regards.  Take care.
[Want to listen to a rap my roommate wrote? (He's white, but not bad\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a63nw?context=5)|Sure shoot me the link.
[What is your opinion of the work done by the Rhymesayers guys? Personally, I think they put out some of the best cuts ever made. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7hgq?context=5)|Damn I could go on.  First RIP Eyedea.  Saw him perform his song Now! live and he didnt miss a beat. That guy was so damn talented.  I literally cried the day he passed away.
 |Watching the Sayers grow has been amazing.  From back when slug was rapping on Dynospectrum to being a ceo of a multimillion dollar label.  Pretty damn impressive.  Plus they have stayed a family through it all as well.  Thats sick. My favorite Atmosphere track is Guarentees and that video is sick.  Brother Ali's track Forrest Whitiker is a classic already in my opinion.  They do good stuff.  RIP Eyedea.
[Lyric video (has better sound\)  One where you can see him.  This one is, in my opinion, his worst one.  But he hasn't uploaded most of them :/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a69e2?context=5)|""losing the sleep at night feeling the creep of fight"" - i like lyrics like that.  Talented writer for sure.  Send him my respect.
[Any MUST HAVE plug-ins? Also, PC or Mac? No hate on either, just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7ejw?context=5)|PC - Im not good with Macs :)  As far as plug-ins everyone is different... theres not really must haves...  its what you best feel you can work with.
[Sweet, thanks! You're the first response I've gotten from an AMA with a famous person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7kdc?context=5)|Im not famous but I appreciate you taking time from you day to inquire about mine for sure ;)  Later!
[Hey, you're a way better producer than me by a long shot, so you're famous in my book! Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7m53?context=5)|Thanks UnknowingWall81 :)  Later.
[Do you have a discography? i'm having trouble finding one online ... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4lde?context=5)|Here is a list of Anno producers - as well as som of the stuff that we have worked on.  Thanks for taking the time to look me up :)  [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini_Beats)
[Thoughts on J Cole?  Great AMA, real down to earth guy. Keep grindin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aauez?context=5)|Sick, thanks bonersoup for the read.  J Cole writes incredibly well.  I mean next level expressing himself.  A+ lyricist.  Thanks again for the comment.
[Would you ever work with Shaquille O'neal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6qju?context=5)|On a song.  LoooL - I would try for sure...  Have to make a slow temp west coast beat for him.
[How was Ghostface Killah is he really a scary dude as everyone says he is? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aaqvg?context=5)|Yes!  Do Not Stare Ghostface Killah in the face.  It will not end well!
[I am freaking out MAN!! Which songs did you produce in particular for him and Method, also did you work with any one in Wu Tang?  Edit: Other than Method for the second question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aazxt?context=5)|Haha. yup, also, along side Meth and ghost, got Inspectah Deck, and prodigal sunn.
[Hey :D.  Firstly, which DAW do you use to make your beats? (I'd imagine FL Studio\). Also, do you have a favorite VST for sounds, or for effects? Finally, where do you get your drum samples?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5t9t?context=5)|Much in FL - East West plugins are great! As far as drum samples no specific place. where ever i find them/come across them.
[Yo.. Did you buy fl when you started using it? Because its a great tool to learn on and I've recently started my own journey in producing, but I couldn't buy fl if I wished right now. I mean as soon as I ever think about selling a beat made with it I'll buy it, but until then, no dice. How about you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6abznx?context=5)|Yes, FL studio is great! One of the best programs out.
[I noticed you've worked with both Shyheim and other Wu-members/affiliates.  I won't ask specifics about them, but does beef between artists ever effect your business or who you can, will, or won't work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a8xus?context=5)|It has not affected my business that much.  Its interesting though because a certain artist that will remain nameless used one of my beats to diss 50cent without my permission - and Im tight with a few of the NY guys and respect the hell out of 50.  So I can see where it can cause some problems.  It hasn't for me.  I try to keep things professional and not let personal suff bother production.  Thanks for the question.
[This is awesome I really enjoy the Anno Domini Beats. I am also a producer but having such a hard time finding people who wanna use my beats. I am interested how did you do it. When was your big break? Any tips for a young producer like myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a77wp?context=5)|Thanks for the support man... not just from me but from the rest of the Anno Domini family.  It is a big struggle at first man but persistence will pay its dividends. I would say my big defining moment or big break was when I got method man to record over one of my beats.  Really proud then.
[Ever work with Nas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a75ed?context=5)|Na never worked with Nas.  One Mic and all the stuff he did with Damien Marley is awesome stuff though.
[Are you upset with Kool Keith's exit from hip hop?  Also, are you friends with KutMasta Kurt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6e0m?context=5)|I think he said he was only considering retiring.  Still he has had massive influence so his contribution was apparent a long time ago.  I just looked it up - he performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos recently :) 
[Top 5 hip hop/rap artists? favorite RA track? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6xbb?context=5)|R.A's verse on Uncommon Valor is unparalleled. Also the track he did with vinnie paz ""Nosebleed"" is sick.
 |Top 5 so hard to say... 5 of my favorites besides already mentioned: 50, wu tang, dmx, redman, choo biggz 
[Who's your favourite rapper right now?  Ever produced for Curren$y?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a65yx?context=5)|Ive never produced for Curren$y and as far as I know no one else from the Anno Domini collective has either. Favorite rapper right now is a toss up.  I like a lot of the guys from New York:  Shyheim, Choo, 50 etc.
[I'm wise of you man, you produce on Shadowville as well if I'm right?  I've recorded a few tracks over your beats, you're a great producer, I am unable to afford your exclusives though, latest beats are so amazing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6adx0b?context=5)|Hey, yea. thank you very much! Its ok to use the beats for non-profit as long as credit is given.
[No mention of illimatic???!!!,??!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7vj5?context=5)|Illmatic was revolutionary for sure. Beats/Rhymes - agreed deserve a mention.
[What are your thoughts on immortal technique and lowkey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a750f?context=5)|Its hard with Tech because I love 84% of what he does and 100% of how he does it.  I think my issue with Tech is the same as my issue with Vinnie Paz.  They are saying some real shit and its easy to get into. Then sadly... bam... vinnies talking about skeletons on the moon and Im lost.  Still Immortal Technique is wonderfully talented and from what I have seen of Lowkey he is as well.  I haven't seen much of him though.  What is you favorite lowkey song that I should check out?
[The last song I recorded over one of your beats was 2 years back: Link to www.hotnewhiphop.com.  My latest: www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvJUnWaIcSA.  You're really talented man, love from the UK! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6adzbl?context=5)|Damn dude you are talented for sure.  Very talented.  Stay writing brother.  You are already good at what you do with room to grow.  You could be making some big moves with your rhymes.  I appreciate their honesty a lot.  Sick.  Respect.
[I'd say long live palestine, something wonderful, and just shine, to name a few. Very talented. Have you heard hopsin? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7tm8?context=5)|Thanks for the suggestions.  Yes I have heard of Hopsin'...  I think he has blown up almost as much as anyone over the last year.  His content is refreshing and his delivery is on point.  He's a talented guy.
[How much do you get paid to make beats? Also, if a song blows up, do you get more in return?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a78ev?context=5)|How much Im paid varies on the project.  Specifics Im contractually not allowed to disclose but yes... if the song is a hit that number skyrockets for sure.
[Have you heard of Jay Park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a57yw?context=5)|I have actually.  He blew up on youtube a couple years ago.
[Who's handling your publishing/admin?  I hate to mix business with Reddit, but it sounds like you should be making some serious mechanical income.  Regardless, keep up the grind and the great placements!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7czu?context=5)|Thanks for taking the time to ask a question.  Out here the royalty company is called the GEMA.  They handle the royalty stuff.
[How rich are you? Do you have porsche? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aca68?context=5)|Not rich... no porsche.  Older Benz :)
[Do you think Vinnie Paz should have used Anno Domini's version of ""Same Story"" for his album?  I LOVE the Scott Stallone version though (been trying to get that instrumental + Domini's for a while now!\). Was just wondering about your thoughts. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a9q0l?context=5)|Naw, I think Vinnie did whats best for his music.  The dude is a beast on the mic and he typically makes good decisions regarding beats.  I support his decision.  Its kind of a blessing anytime someone of his caliber is willing to even get on your beat.  He's does excellent work and he has long ago established himself as an underground legend.
[I'll have to check your stuff out, you come across as an intelligent reasonable person.  What are your thoughts on the electronic scene with artists like Deadmouse, Skrillix and Flying Lotus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a88s2?context=5)|Thanks a lot.  I have listened to some Skrillix.  There is some good stuff there but for the most part I am not really into electronic music for I think the same reason some people arent into hiphop.  the repetitive noises do get to me a bit more in electronic stuff not exactly sure why because I know the same exists in hiphop to some degree.
[Do you get paid at all by all the basketball highlight clips on YouTube that use your beats? see comments all the time saying, ""the beat's way better than the video!"" that's how i'd heard of you fwiw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a62mw?context=5)|There is actually a contract in place for some of the baskeyball highlight videos and of course others are fan made.  I dont know much about contract specifics but yes our music was licensed for those videos.
[Sick beats you got there...  When you say platinum selling, what platinum hits have you provided beats for? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ab6p0?context=5)|Thanks a lot man.  The only platinum track I was a part of was with the beat I made for a french group called Sexion D'assaut.  [Here is the song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MzYca2HbRs&amp;feature=youtu.be)
[Thanks man, I appreciate it. You're rockin' this AMA as well btw! My favorite beat artist is Dave Tipper. If you want to hear creative beats and sounds in a studio, he's a true pioneer with noise! This is one of his latest EP's. Peace!  Bubble Control.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ab1x2?context=5)|Wow.  thats strange stuff.  the beginning was almost like theme music for a swimming level in a mario game   Enjoyed the share again.  thanks :)
[My friend said he's still recording it this week (He's in college\) would it be cool with you that I send you the link after he finishes the recording? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a91rp?context=5)|Of course man.  I login to reddit once a week or much more so just shoot me a link here when you get it.  Take care.
[How did you get with French rappers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6jnn?context=5)|Their manager contacted me after they had heard my beats.  That was the start of it.
[Do you speak French? How was the communication with foreign artists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6o57?context=5)|Nope. I dont speak french and it was nearly impossible to commuicate correctly with them.  Hahaha :)  But damn something clicked between us.
[Why are you selling Platinum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aa2cs?context=5)|Four and one eighth to the left.

[Anno Domini! Wow, I remember when I first started writing scouring through soundclick and the first pages I would check would be Anno Domini, actually until this day I still do, so major props to you.

**3.450** sleeping in fighters for **8 months!** 

Imagine yourself in your pyjamas, or like jaxspider in your birthday suit, on a random night, before the day you have an important appointment early in the morning. Before you are ready to enter the [magical dream world](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/) you quickly set your alarm before you forget it. You fall asleep, your head being cuddled by the soft pillow, not realising what tomorrow will actually bring you.     
The next morning your alarm goes off. It's one of your favorite songs which you decided to use as an alarm, because then you would wake up happy. You hate it now. And because you are getting irritated as hell, you turn the alarm quickly off.      
You turn your head, now looking in the shadows instead of the light coming behind of the curtains, taking a deep breath.     
*""I can rest for another 5 minutes""* you think, followed by a gape.       
Your eyes close slowly.       
You open them again but there is something wrong.      
You feel awake. *too awake*. You look quickly at your clock and realise that in the what seemed like 5 seconds time, an hour has gone by. And the three feared words rush through your mind resulting in feeling a cold shiver down your spine: *I'm too late*. 

Now imagine the fact that there exists a subreddit, capable of making that scene never happen in your life (again). Sounds good right? What if i told you it exists? ""Get Out""! You will yell.      

Well, I'm glad i had found this subreddit because i've had multiple encounters with the sleeping in experience. With some big impact as result. Let's not get into details, i will just say it had something to do with the following words: Friends, weekend, job, no job. So i am more than happy to feature this subreddit, for you.

/r/GetOutOfBed gives you the best tips and tricks to get out of bed or to improve your sleep. For every person whose brain [decideded](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/yytsm/august_28_2012_rmyevilplan_my_evil_plan_is_to/) to get him/her almost every morning, this could be the antidote. But waking up by using an [irish waking song](http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=KgoczbY99OA) isn't enough. You need to get out of bed immediately.

So, are you getting excited to learn more about /r/GetOutOfBed? I had an informative talk with the friendly /u/ashrewdmint, moderator and creator of /r/GetOutOfBed, who will give you an idea of how /r/GetOutOfBed looks like.


&gt;##1.How did you come up with the idea to make /r/GetOutOfBed? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** At the start of this year, i really wanted to start getting out of bed regularly. I was inspired by other self-help subreddits and decided to start my own, just to see what would happen. Unfortunately, i have fallen off the bandwagon myself, but i'm glad to know that it's still a resource that helps others. 

&gt;##2.What sort of posts does one find here? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** Anything about sleep or sleep hacking is welcome, including tricks to get yourself out of bed. Sometimes people will post a nightly thread to announce they will get out of bed at a certain time in the morning or not to sleep in. 

&gt;##3.What is the best tip/trick you have seen posted? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** a popular trick is to practice getting up in the morning by using this: http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right-away-when-your-alarm-goes-off/ 

&gt;##4.Can    you    tell    me    in     a    few    sentences    why    i    should    /r/GetOutOfBed?     A    reason    to    improve    my    sleep?
&gt;&gt;    **ashrewdmint**    Well,    it    seems    that    sleep    is    really    a    challenge    for    people    in    developed    countries    and    we    never    seem       to    get     enough    of    it.    I    think    the    fact    that    most    people    have    a    hard    time    getting     out     of    bed    in     the    morning,    or    wake    up    uncomfortably    to    a    blaring    alarmclock,    is    a    sign    that    something    is    wrong.    Besides    just    the    quality    of    life    issue,    there’s    also    a    personal    motivation    issue    involved    with    sleeping    in.    I    want    to    wake    up    motivated    and    energized,    not    lazy    or    depressed.    And    I    think     that    you    can’t    really     isolate    the    selfcontrol    aspect    from    the    sleep    quality    or    health    quality    aspect.    I    find    that    if    I    get    bad     sleep,    forcing     myself    to    get    up    at    a    regular    hour    isn't    sustainable.    Ultimately    it    comes    down    to    what    you    want    from    your    life.    Do    you    want     to    feel    refreshed    and    energized    and    motivated     instead     of    lazy    and    complacent    when    you    first    wakeup?    Do     you    want    to    optimize    your    sleep    and    feel    great?    If    so,    then     I    think    those    ideals    naturally    lead    to    /r/GetOutOfBed.


&gt;##5.I   wake    in    the    middle    of     the     night     out     of     nowhere     multiple     times.     How     can    i    prevent     this    from    happening    again?
&gt;&gt;    **ashrewdmint**    Sleep    is    pretty    complicated,    and    I'm    not    too    qualified    to    Shell    out    advice.    But    I    can    list    things    that    have    helped    for    me    or     things    that    I'm    pretty    sure     will    affect    overall    sleep    quality.        

&gt;&gt;    1.Change     up     your     diet    if     you      have     any     digestion     issues.     I     eat     mostly     Paleo     and     that     helped     my      overall     health     and     sleep     quality.    Eeriment     with     cutting     out     certain     kinds     of     food     and      see      how     you     feel     afterwards.     Test     various     things     and     reflect     on     the     outcomes.            

&gt;&gt;    2.Limit     artificial      light     exposure.     This     is     probably      one     of      the     huge     things     that     has     changed     sleeping      habits     in     post-industrial     cultures.     Circadian     rhythms     are     ingrained      in     biological      structures     and     humans     are     no    exception.     Light     is     one      of     the     big      things     that    will     influence     your     clock,     and      blue      wavelengths     of     light      are     interpreted     by     your     brain     as     daytime.    If     you     are     in     front     of     a     computer     screen     or     a     TV     a     lot     at     night,     that     is     actually     going     to     decrease     your      brain's    production      of      melatonin      (a      hormone      that      makes      you      sleepy).      I     use      [f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/)      to      change      the       color      of      my      laptop      screen      at      night.      It      makes      it      warmer      and     more     yellow-y,     which     reduces    the      amount     of     blue     light     that     would     be     in     a     completely     white     screen.     I      also     will     wear    red-tintend     glasses     or     goggles     to     help     mitigate     the     effects     of     regular     indoor     lighting.     In     the     future    I     want     to    get    prescription     sunglasses     or     something     so    I    can     do     things     at     night     and     still     see,     but     also     reduce     the     effects     of     bright     or     white     light.     I     also     want    to    see     what     happens     if     the    sunglasses     are     darker     and     if     having      dim     light     is     more     important     than     just     having     red/yellow-tinted     light.           

&gt;&gt;    3.Take     lots     of     Vitamin     D     in     the     morning—like 5,000-10,000     IU.     [More     about     that    here](http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/).                 

&gt;&gt;    4.Calm     down.     This     is     something     that     I     recently      figured     out.     Although     diet      and     light     exposure     do    have     effects,     it     doesn't     matter     how     great     everything     else     is     in     your     life,     if      your      mind     is    stressed     and     racing     and     you     can't     calm     down,     you     will     get     really    crappy    sleep    if     you     sleep     at    all.     At     least,     that's     what     I     discovered       for     
myself.     Here's       what     helps     me     a     lot:       

&gt;&gt;    * Have     a     regular     evening     routine,    and    stick    to    it.     Make    it    an    iron    law.      

&gt;&gt;    * Experiment      with     binaural     beats.     I     use     the     iPhone's     SleepStream     app     and     choose    the     ""Deep     sleep"" wavelength,     but     there     are     also     lots     of     binaural     beat     videos     on     YouTube.    I     haven't     fully     researched     real     studies     done     on     beats,     and     although     it     may     be     a   placebo,     it's      a     placebo      that    works      for     me.     And     if     it     works,      I      don't     really     care     how     it     works.     

&gt;&gt;    * Sit     without     a     chair     and     count.     I      like     the     [seiza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiza)     position,     but     I     use     pillows     to     make     it      more comfortable     for     me.     I'm     not     used      to     it     enough     to     be      comfortable     without     it,     and     my     legs     still     fall     asleep,     but       I'm      getting      better.          
I    count     to     100     and     start     over,     counting     on     inhalation     and     exhalation,     but     only     going     to     the next     number      on      the     next     inhalation.     This     seems     to     help     focus     my     mind     and     it     helps     me     wind     down.     If     you     attempt        this     and      feel     restless,      anxious,     bored     or     frustrated,     it     means     you    really     need     to     do     it     and     you     should     keep     going.     The     more     you     feel     like     avoiding     calming    down,     the     more     you     need     to     calm     down.     At     least,     that     is     what     I     have     found     for     myself.         
   
&gt;&gt;    Anyway,     there's     a     lot     more     you     can     find     out     about     this     subject     and     I     encourage      you     to     have fun     researching     and     finding     things     out     for     yourself.     Unfortunately     I     don't     have     the     time     to     back    up     a     lot     of     what     I     am        saying    here    with     links,    but    it    is     generally        easy     to     find     where     I     am     getting     this     stuff     with     Google.

104hk7,1,2012-09-19,I wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for this program. white folk need not apply. Seriously though...,[deleted],advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/104hk7/i_wouldnt_have_a_job_if_it_wasnt_for_this_program/,"It's called [MAIP](http://www.aaaa.org/careers/maip/Pages/maip_students.aspx#how) and it is an absolutely phenomenal program for multicultural guys and gals. 


It's the Multicultural Advertising Internship Program. Pretty much, you apply for your position (pretty much any position in advertising) you do a lot of work for the application, if you're applying to be a creative you need to have a portfolio (mine was terrible, don't let it stop you) and do a campaign for them. (the rules may have changed since I was in it)


If you get through the semi-finals and finals and all that, they'll give your name out to a lot of big agencies mostly in New york, but also in Chicago and San Fran and a couple other places and they pick you from a list. I could be wrong, but a lot of big agencies here always pick at least one or two interns from this pool. When I interned, my agency picked about 6 of us from this list.


 My partner and I were hired on full time after our internship and I attribute it directly to MAIP. I wouldn't have had a chance without them. It's an amazing program. I can't talk it up enough. 


If you have any questions about it, let me know. I'll try to answer them for you. But seriously, If you qualify, and you have no earthly idea how you can make your way to a great agency in a great city, you really should apply. It absolutely changed my life. I wouldn't be here if I didn't apply. 


Good luck, folks. 


*Edit: Oh yeah, it's for a summer internship... I think portfolio school students can apply too, but I don't really remember and I don't care about you enough to look into it. "
104h2f,5,2012-09-19,Funding for Graduate Studies Abroad,hde128,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/104h2f/funding_for_graduate_studies_abroad/,"(I feel like this has been asked before and I might just be awful with the search function, but here it goes.)

I'm a mechanical engineering student in my final year of studies and naturally I'm looking into my graduate school options. I intend to go to graduate school in biomedical engineering to study artificial organs and/or tissue engineering, possibly with some regenerative medicine on the side. Because I'm an engineering student, I have no plans to pay for graduate school. (I don't mean to sound like an entitled douche who thinks he deserves free access to education. I just want to avoid going into debt and instead work through school as a GRA/GTA.) I'm planning to apply to some schools abroad alongside a handful of top-tier public schools. (As this is not /r/IWantOut I don't feel the need to go into much depth as to why.) However, I'm finding that funding is harder to come by as an international student. How would I go about paying for graduate school/living expenses as an American studying in a foreign country? Canada, the Netherlands, and Germany are the three countries in which I'm most interested.

Further background if it's necessary: I have a 3.88 GPA and a year and a half of work experience as an intern, which I'm using to fund a research-based, biology-heavy study abroad program for the spring in order to help me bridge the gaps between mechanical and biomedical and between industry and research. I think I have a reasonable shot at funding, but I don't know where to look.

tl;dr: How does an American ME-&gt;BME student get paid to get a MS/possibly Ph. D in Canada/Holland/Germany?"

1049zj,10,2012-09-18,"I am a freshman in college and just got my first photography job. As an amateur, I could use some basic tips regarding etiquette and just photo shoots in general. Can you help me out Reddit?",[deleted],photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1049zj/i_am_a_freshman_in_college_and_just_got_my_first/,"So here's a little background:

I go to university of about 5,500 students. At the beginning of the year, I applied for a couple jobs including an internship with the photographer of the university, who is obviously an extremely experienced photographer. I interviewed, and got the job. And this job is basically my dream job as a college student. I'm getting paid to do something that I love and the boss as well as the people I work with are fantastic. Basically, my job is to go out, and take pictures of various events around campus when they are assigned to me. The majority of these events aren't really too big, maybe 50 to 100 people per event. And these are events mostly consist of: a couple public speakers, food, and a lot of socializing among the student body and whatnot. I had my first photo shoot tonight, and overall, I thought it went really well, but I was left with a couple of questions:

I'll try to cut to the chase with these questions (sorry if a couple of them are a little stupid).

**How exactly do I approach people when asking to take their picture?** I feel like people give me mean stares and hate me when I do this. Is there are particular way to ask them?

I would love just basic tips on situations like this but I really do not have a really good idea. **Things like: How to handle all the gear (changing lenses), Should I socialize with the people? And just basic things like that.** 

Although I loved the photo shoot, for me, it was a really awkward few hours. And I would love to learn more about how to handle events like this. 

P.S. I am a pretty severe stutterer, making it a little harder for me to approach people, bit I still do what's necessary to get the shots I want.

Thank you in advance Reddit! If you need a little more explaining just let me know."
1046e2,1,2012-09-18,"My son still lives at home and wants his girlfriend to move in with us because she's being abused by her step dad. Am I a bad person if I say ""NO""?",ParentalThrowAwayMRS,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1046e2/my_son_still_lives_at_home_and_wants_his/,"Okay. My husband and I have 4 kids. Daughter 1 is 21 and in the military. Son 1 is 19 and lives at home. Son 2 is 18, lives at home and is in his third year of college, and is the one in question. Son 3 is 16 and lives at home/goes to highschool. 

That being said, we have a small house because we're poor. Really it's only technically two bedrooms, but we've converted a section of a basement and a small storage closet to bedrooms. My husband and I sleep in the largest room. Son 1 sleeps in the other bedroom (still fairly large). Son 2 sleeps in the closet (there's a twin bed, a little table, and a lamp in there. Nothing else fits. His dresser is at a little nook in the staircase). Son 3 sleeps in the basement.

So needless to say, things are cramped. Now he's come and asked me if his girlfriend (she's 17) can move in with us because she's being abused by her step father. I said to just call the cops and let them handle it, but they refuse to because then her parents won't sign her FAFSA forms and she won't get financial aid.

Am I a bad person if I say no? Things are cramped as is. Even if she did move in, we'd have to find another bedroom because I will NOT allow them to share one. And really, we can't afford to feed another person or let them use water.

She can't move out on her own because she can't afford it. (She's taking 22 credits at school instead of finding a job). I told son 2 to just rent her an apartment or room or something, but he claims he can't afford it. (Which isn't true. He's making tons of money at his internship. Like $20+ or even $25+ an hour. My husband is looking for work and I make only slightly above minimum wage)."

In my other classes in past years I had little interest because they did not interest me and I was just forced to take them (this is not a good excuse, but that is just how I dealt with them, which is regrettable today). That combined with a bout of depression and anxiety, I would skip class and not care at all. Ever since then I am fine and doing relatively well, mentally and in school.

Basically, I want to know what kind of career options I have? I honestly just want to know what is available and slim it down from there. I know I can't be too picky given the job environment combined with my transcript and lack of experience. Thanks to anyone who can give me advice or any useful information."

107y7a,2,2012-09-20,Need help Reddit - bad,24yearoldrandomguy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/107y7a/need_help_reddit_bad/,"Alright, Reddit. I need your help. Let me just give you a background on me and then any help/advice you have is greatly appreciated.

I am 24. I have always been a high achiever. Unbelievably high achiever.

In high school, I was HC king, captain of sports teams, and even recruited to play a college sport. I ended up going to a big University of 28,000+ people, and I earned a degree in Applied Economic Management (to be a Certified Financial Planner). 

At my University, I was heavily involved and excelled academically. Eventually, I became the Student Body President by my senior year. I was well liked, and did extremely well with women. I started a successful non-profit (that I no longer am a big part of), had successful internships, etc.

After graduating, in December 2010, I had three job offers and chose to move to Charlotte to work for one of the biggest investment firms. I was a relationship manager to high net worth families, managing a book of business worth $1.4 billion dollars. The craziest part was that I was 23 and the next youngest person was in their 30s. So, I was given an opportunity of my lifetime, and I excelled.

I started dating the girl of my dreams in March 2011, and she was the Student Body President at her college (that's how we met in like 2009). Our relationship was amazing -- even though we were long distance for about a year. I went through an existential crisis in December 2011, but I got through it. Spoke with a counselor, and my girlfriend was my rock. I didn't really have a group of friends in Charlotte, mostly because I don't like drinking. I went to various meetups, but basically just hung out with my girlfriend all of the time. Life was great, until July...

So, basically, my girlfriend and I moved in together in April. Life was good at first....she even got me a dog for my birthday (in May)! But then she had her quarter-life crisis and I became unhappy at my job. She hated her job and just was unhappy in general. We fought over stupid things, and ended up taking a break in July. 

Early August comes around and we officially break up (after 1 1/2 years), she moves back to NY, and takes the dog, too (I advised her to take him...I'll let you know in a second). I take two days off work after we broke up to be around people from my old University (administrators, friends who either work for the University or who are getting their PhDs), and I feel refreshed. New job opportunities open up for me at said University (I was offered a job with a company there, as well as, a free MBA). And a week later I get a call from one of my mentors who offers me an opportunity of the lifetime.....

He offers me a paid job to be the ""marketing guy"" for a venture capital backed educational technology startup in the Washington D.C area. It's a slight paycut, but he convinces me by saying, ""This is your once in a lifetime opportunity to be a social entrepreneur."" Plus, he offers me equity. 

I think about it a lot -- ask him to give me a week. I had never thought about leaving (financial services) company. I had a great relationship with my co-workers; I just wasn't happy with my life. I spoke with my manager on Wednesday; my company tried really hard to retain me. Nevertheless, after a lot of thought and conversations on the phone with friends/family/mentors, I decided to take the risk. 

Ironically, he needed me to start after labor day, which was the same day I needed to be moved out of my apartment! So, I moved back to the DC area to live with my aunt (temporarily), and I've been working here for 2 weeks. 

Now, here's my situation:

I am unbelievably depressed, and I have no idea why.  I have been unbelievably unproductive at work and there's a lot of pressure. We need teachers to sign up, but our product is a little complicated, and I don't know the industry. I used to do all of the marketing for my non-profit, but in 2 years, the entire world of marketing has changed. 

My work is in ""education technology"" and we offer a free service to schools. I don't wake up every day excited about edtech. Everyone used to describe me in three words: Passionate, enthusiastic, and an unparalleled work ethic. I wake up exhausted. I haven't been sleeping well. I am apathetic. I can't even read and comprehend information (I read and then I have to re-read because I forgot what I read).  I saw a doctor and was prescribed anti-depressants. I had blood work done and I am going in tomorrow to review the results. 

I've always read that in order to feel self-motivated, you must ask yourself three questions:

1) Can I do it?
2) Will it work?
3) Is it worth it?

I don't know if I can answer yes to any of those questions right now. 

What the hell is wrong with me?

Need insight!,obsessedwithpenguins,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/107vuc/i_need_help_figuring_out_how_to_pitch_for_a/,"Alright, for starters I am incredibly obsessed with penguins. My entire life I have been taken with these majestic sea birds because of how incredibly unique and adorable they are. When I became aware of the Penguin Conservation Center in Cape Town, I decided that I would do everything in my power to one day go there. Since then, I have changed my major to Wildlife Resources so that I can at least get my foot in the door to one day working with them in their natural habitat. For the purposes of my degree program, I am required to fulfill 80 hours of internship work and am beyond excited that the work at the PCC would fulfill this.
Anyway, I have crunched numbers and figured out that, at the very least, I need to come up with $4000 to cover airfare, my room and board at the center, and food, for a 6 week trip. I have looked into creating a ChipIn account, but have yet to really brainstorm a ""pitch"" to get people to contribute to my cause; I realize what I'm wanting to do is mostly selfish... I will hope to document my experience with SANCCOB (http://www.sanccob.co.za/[1] ), and the reasons for wanting to work with penguins in the future is to raise awareness of their need for human help (overfishing diminishing their food source, climate change impacting their habitat, etc), but it's selfish because this is MY dream to go and I'm only asking people to financially help me because while I'll be in school full time, I don't have the means to pay for it all by my lonesome.
I've had the idea of helping to fund myself by selling my paintings that I create with my boobs (Here's a link to some of them, I did a post a month or so ago where I got a lot of positive feedback, but all those that said they'd buy one, didn't come through http://imgur.com/a/mdxNj [2] ). Once I start school again, I'll be investing in many more canvases, get to painting, and get better pictures of the finished product in hopes of selling them, but I'm wondering if I'll even have success at that.
To sum up, I'm looking for insight and advice on how to fund this dream of mine. If anyone has done this or is well informed on how to, please help! And of course, constructive criticism is welcome. Thanks in advance, Reddit."
107u5r,2,2012-09-20,middle school English - literature circles,rain27,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/107u5r/middle_school_english_literature_circles/,"Hi folks! I'm a first-year teacher in an urban middle school. I spent two years in a high school in the same area as an intern, so a lot of what I'm struggling with is making the adjustment from high school to 6th grade. 

So far it seems like a funny but very interesting age group--they are such a mix of still a baby and surprisingly mature that it keeps my head spinning! I'm starting my second unit soon, and for my third I was thinking about trying more of a literature circles approach with my reading. I've done it (more or less) in high school, and I'm hoping to get more buy-in and engagement if the kids have some choice in the book (out of a selection) and if they are working in groups and have more control. I will also be able to differentiate a little better that way.

So I guess what I'm looking for is ANY advice on this. My concerns are:
1) We deal with a lot of behavioral issues constantly, so I don't know if tons of small group focused work would be too hard to manage. But whole-class or silent reading isn't sunshine and rainbows either.
2) With Lit Circles, I'm not sure how I'm going to do my mini-lessons, because we're not all reading the same book. I still need a text to teach inferring and all that. Picture books or something? A common text?

I'm really trying to find that weird place middle schoolers inhabit, and how best to reach them there. (Especially these middle schoolers--we are playing out the familiar story of white, overeducated, idealistic new teacher and mostly minority, inner-city kids who have dealt with more life-wise already than I probably ever will.) Will more independence empower them or backfire into chaos? Do pictures books excite them or make them feel treated like children? How do I go about doing this?

I know this is a very specific question. But if anybody out there has any similar experiences, I would really appreciate pointers. 

Thank you!"

107sga,0,2012-09-20,EE or BME?,Saleomar,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/107sga/ee_or_bme/,"Hey guys,

I'm looking for some guidance from current engineers. I am a senior biomedical engineering (BME) student at an east coast university. I am a years worth of senior design away fro my degree, but I have a problem. I don't feel like I know enough to be a valuable contributor to an engineering project just yet.

The way BME at my university works is that it is part of the ECE department. About 50% of my degree was EE courses. However, I keep hearing how BME majors have trouble finding jobs simply because of the lack of focus in the major (which I agree wholeheartedly with now after 4 years of it). 

To make a long story short, I took around 10 graduate level BME classes as my electives (not realizing I wouldn't be able to get a graduate degree from them) because I would be double counting them as undergraduate and graduate level courses. So I came up with a potential solution: switch my undergrad degree to EE.

It would only take 1 extra year (luckily, my mothers life insurance will cover the tuition cost) to finish the degree and I MAY, keyword MAY, be able to have the school transfer my graduate classes towards a masters in BME. In addition it will help me boost my GPA a little bit more and I would get to continue my internship in a lab for another year.

My question for you guys is this: is a degree in EE worth the extra year regardless of whether or not I get the masters degree in BME?

**TL;DR - Should I switch to EE (1 more year of school) or finish my BME degree?**

**EDIT: Changed ""BME"" acronym to Biomedical Engineering**"
107qlo,2,2012-09-20,How many adults here still live with their parents?,10thplanetwestLA,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/107qlo/how_many_adults_here_still_live_with_their_parents/,"I grew up in the '80s and any sitcom that had scenes of girls dating 'losers' was because the guy still lived at home with their parents.  Personally, I couldn't wait to move out and was one of my main motivators to apply for college.  I have a professional degree and a decent job to afford to live on my own, but if the worst were to happen in my career, moving back home would be my last option.  I'd much rather call in favors from friends or work a minimum wage job.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't have a bad home life.  My parents didn't abuse me or do any drugs (maybe a little alcohol)...just a regular upbringing.  It just seems surreal to me that anyone can still live at home after the age of 18, but maybe it's just me.  

EDIT:  After reading some of the replies, I see the following exceptions to living at home as an adult:
1.  You're still in school (Undergrad up to 22-23 years old and Graduate school, any age)
2.  You pay rent to your parents to keep the money within the family.
3.  Physical and/or mental disability that prevents you from living on your own.
4.  You had a job/career and were laid off or can't find a job after college due to the unemployment rate.  However, in this scenario, you really should be actively pursuing jobs, polishing up your resume, networking to find job leads or even taking an unpaid internship to get some experience.  Thinking of it as a vacation or free time to relax and play video games is not cool "

[Part1]http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/1022ig/discussion_i_had_one_of_the_worst_days_cheer_me/

and this...[part2]http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/1037sy/thanks_and_update_on_my_health/

[videos]http://www.ic-network.com/videos/ On Tuesday after my scary saga I spent almost an hour on the phone with this on the videos woman. She really helped me to understand what is going on with my body. Since doctors haven't helped or given me any information really. One of my biggest anxieties has been having to change my diet. I LOVE food, all food. Anyone who knows me knows I love food and love to make it. She told me I don't have to accept but I have to respect it. Then she told me the doctor I am seeing is one of the top 3 IC specialist in the country and that I was very fortunate to get in with him.

I told her about my desire to be a patient advocate. She told the the ICN only hires IC patients and that they are always looking for work and internships. They have helped people get their masters and PhD. She said there was work I could do from home and that if I am as passionate as I am about it to get back in contact with her when I am feeling better. What a WONDERFULLY IRONIC opportunity this disease has given me?

Today I met with the specialist. He was wonderful and through. He asked me a lot of questions and went through my entire medical history. He said that I most definitely have IC and probably pelvic floor dysfunction. He ordered test to determine how bad it is. He also ordered physical therapy. He assured me that this is going to be a step by step process, that will take time but he will get me there. 

They also removed my catheter. Turns out I was outfitted with a catheter WAY too big for me. The first thing the nurse said when she went to take it out was; ""OMG this is HUGE, well not HUGE but very large for a woman let alone someone with IC. This should have never been used on you period."" So that would explain why the pain got so much worse. Why I was in tears. Why every step I took, every move I made was agonizing. I am already in much less pain post-cath removal. This has been one of the hardest months of my life but there is light at the end of the tunnel. I may have opened the door to my career and I feel empowered that I was able to advocate for myself and make it through all the pain. 

This group has also helped get me through the last few weeks. I am glad I stumbled here when I did. :) Hope all is well and TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH!!! 

Edit 1: Karmic Irony here: My parents had Chinese for dinner. I stole a fortune cookie. It said ""In order to do something, you have to learn to be something."" So in order to be a patient advocate, I have to learn to not only be a patient but an advocate. Thank you capitalism and westernized Chinese food for shoving that one in my face right now of all times. lmao

I've got a few ideas kicking around, but I figured that it might be fun to throw the doors open to Reddit. I don't need a full synopsis, just give me a basic idea or a word and I'll use it as the seed to hopefully write a book of some sort. It might not be a long book, it might never get released... but I'll make sure it gets written.

I'll pick my favourite idea. It might not be the one with the most upvotes, but there's no harm in using them to help sway me."

Is it worth the money?  Considering you do get a TIGA Diploma and you can get an internship with legitimate development companies aswell as the involvement of video game royalty like Moloneux and Blazinski, I still have my doubts.

I originaly went and applied to just receive the training to be a games tester, but because I tinkered around with C++ and was making a pokemon rom hack and knew my shit, well, some of my shit, they suggested I go for development instead.

After digging around it bacame aparant that they were just polishing my marble as it were, making me feel a bit special, a bit more competant than I am at game development and programming

I'm having second thoughts, can someone tell me more about the course and what happened to them after they finished it?

Would I be better off teaching myself and going to a games studio after making a mod or somthing? "

Every meetup, conference, or dinner I meet other engineers, managers, and recruiters who tell me they are having a really hard time finding android talent, and the ones they find are inadequate.  This comes from contacts at Twitter, Facebook, and other big names you'd expect.  This also comes from first hand experience.  We get 2x the number of iOS candidates as Android, even though we put equal effort on both.  I've interviewed dozens engineers in the last 6 months and we hired one of them in the SF Bay.  Where are all the good Android engineers?

There has to be some great indie devs or people wanting to jump ship on this subreddit that would love to work at tech companies in the SF Bay.

Seriously, apply with us [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/careers), or other cool startups.  You have a great opportunity right now because the demand is so high.

At Evernote, we're looking for multiple android roles, for our core product, for our sdk, and for spinoff products, both jr and sr level.  We even do Android internships.

Make sure you know what the hell you are talking about before you waste anyones time though.

Edit1: This got big, Great! Seems like a lot of interning interest.  I'll be collecting info sent to me and sending it over to recruiting end of the day tomorrow. 

Some clarification. I'm a real engineer, not with HR.  I just enjoy helping grow the company and the Android platform grow.  I do help a lot with interviewing, conferences, etc... on top of my normal engineering responsibilities."
107e48,12,2012-09-20,"A rising concern from someone with a ""game design"" degree",NotyoWookie,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/107e48/a_rising_concern_from_someone_with_a_game_design/,"Hey r/gamedev,    (the last paragraph sums a bit of this up if it's too long for you)

It seems that a couple times a week now a new post pops up on this sub that talks about how terrible a degree focused on game development/design/etc. is from places like University of Phoenix, Kaplan, Colorado Tech. Institute, etc. Everytime I read one of these posts my heart sinks a little bit more and my stress levels kick into overdrive.
EDIT: Hey everyone, really appreciate the helpful responses. I'm glad to have been given actual constructive feedback for once. I will definitely look into trying to get a jump on a couple engines and try some of the self-teach programming for now since that's all that's really available to me at the moment where I'm at. I'm going to stick with the Game Design route I think, but I'm not 100% decided yet. I have a lot more confidence now that I'll be able to pull this off if I can just build up my portfolio and really get my hands dirty making prototypes and learning various skills. Thanks everyone!


I'm currently enrolled at Full Sail University for a BS in Game Design. I know a lot of you are skeptical or flat out trash Full Sail and I was right there with you up until the start of this year. After looking into it, however, I grew to actually respect the school more and more. It seemed like a legitimate school, had a broad focus on programs in the arts, film, gaming, and other media, and through my research I never really found anyone saying anything bad about the school (until I found this subreddit a bit back).  At no point have I really had a moment where I'm thinking, ""Oh fuck, Full Sail is like going to fucking CTU, what did I just do.""

I'm currently active duty military and after coming back from deployment I decided to get a jump start on my education. I want to try and minimize my career unemployment time between jobs and thought that this seemed like the place to do it. I enrolled in Feb. of this year and have only a couple months left in the army pending how well my surgeries go. I have so far not really had any concerns except for the fact that it's hard to work very extended full time hours as the classes start picking up. It's also all online and I'm a much more classroom oriented individual, and I think this gives teachers the oppurtunity to make students self-teach rather than do their job, but hey, you'll find that anywhere. 

I'm very serious when I say I want to make a career out of the gaming industry. I like to think I'm not at all naiive when it comes to how hard it is to break into it, what all the jobs require of you, that there's no such thing as an ""idea"" guy, etc. I'm a very commited, driven individual, who wants to get the most out of his education and come to my hopeful future employers with more than a piece of paper. 

I'm concerned that I'm going to be missing out on a lot more than someone who gets a programming or computer science degree from a 4 year+ university. I do my own self-teaching with certain programs (though I'm having some trouble where to start sometimes), and I plan on at least getting some programming under my belt through things like these online 8 week courses, or what have you. I know it's nothing like going to school for programming, but I can at least have a better understanding. I plan on applying to intern with certain companies now that I'll be out of the army, make and work on as many prototypes as I can, and just generally try and build up my resume to show I'm not just some asshole with a degree. 

This is a long winded way to say I'm concerned my degree at Full Sail will hinder my progress into the gaming industry. That no matter what I try and do outside of school, I'll just be passed up by a guy from a 4 year uni that did similar things as me. Is this something you all have encountered and what would you do? I feel like I'm already commited to this college and If I stop I'll have just wasted more of my money. Hard work and going above and beyond isn't an issue with me. I know I'm not the only one in this boat and everyone seems to just criticize or dismiss anyone who is starting out.

(this was a lot better worded, but my browser closed itself and I rushed while at work, sorry)

Edit: Title should have said ""pursuing a game design degree"" and I meant to add I apologize in advance if this isn't the best place for this or this is too ""newbie"" of a post."

I know it's not really imperative for me to be a part of any of those awards/programs, but i feel like my experience is so shallow that without the help, i'd be in a tough position :/

This past summer I had an internship with the 4A's MAIP program and i'm currently abroad in Asia traveling and studying media consumption and culture. I realize maybe these might be unique points, however I feel because there are so many students entering the work force, it's really not much...

I know a few internships and programs already have their applications up and I'll try to find the time to apply for those, but for actual job positions when and where should i start looking for those instead of internship experience??

16? You added the search mod? Ok - yeah… gotta add the 4 there. 20! **

Before you stands a male with a history in graphic and web design along with writing, cooking, retail and production. A Bardic Knowledge bonus to the check reveals his comic writing got him a write up in Wizard Magazine as one of 5 writers to look for in the next 5 years. 

**You want to learn more - Gather Info. Nat 20? And a synergy with Knowledge local? Whoooooooo!**

Luke studied **Graphic Design** as a votech student during high school. In addition he was also a **Boy Scout**, was a star player on the Academic Quiz Team, brought his **Skills USA** Quiz Team to state for Bronze, was a member of the Skills USA Section Parliament and started on building connections to various people
.
When he went to college at the **Art Institute of Pittsburgh** he ended up changing his focus from Graphic Design to **Web Design and Interactive Media**, hoping to have a wider range of knowledge. While there he ended up assisting web musician superstar **Akira the Don** who commented **""For the past few years Luke Herr has been in regular contact with me, offering his ideas, many of them excellent. His insight, persistence, and unwavering enthusiasm would be a valuable asset to any organization.""**

He ended up working **McDonald's** for a while where he had customers thank the manager for his upbeat attitude, followed by a stint at a now closed comic shop which he enjoyed a lot more, before leaving to focus on his portfolio and internship and everywhere he went he brought the same positivity. 

The internship with **Let's Be Friends Again and Adam WarRock** was mutually beneficial one where Luke learned a lot about content management, concert booking, forum creation and problem solving.  Curt Franklin, writer of Let's Be Friends Again, commented **""Not to be too hyperbolic, but Luke was an excellent intern. He regularly updated us as to where he was on the various projects assigned to him, he was extremely proficient in the various software we asked him to use. If he wasn't familiar with something he took it upon himself to research and learn it as quickly as possible. He worked more hours than we asked him to and also showed lots of initiative when it came to working on our web forums and our site.""**

Two weeks before graduation, disaster struck when his computer and his backup were destroyed in a freak desk-with-a-swinging-arm accident but he didn't give up. Faced with 3 freelance projects, 5 finals, his own portfolio, the Small Press Expo and his own portfolio display he beat finished all of his projects. He finished the three websites before his own work, received A's on his finals, which included a presentation on Jack Kirby's The Eternals and another on Let's Be Friends Again Inc, had good enough sales at SPX all with time to spare. Unfortunately, the portfolio show was poorly attended due to random chance and a really crappy day to hold it so he didn't get a job then and there. Also he slay an orc.

So after that he returned home for free rent and board to work on freelance but now he desires something more steady, social, continuous and creative in between writing web comics, working on his graphic novel and operating [Nerdcenaries, a fake comic news site](nerdcenaries.com). After a very recent incident with factory labor to make some extra cash, he decided he might take to Reddit and approach the situation from another angle.
His site, which is currently being revamped [is located here](http://www.lukeherr.com/).

He is willing to move just about anywhere, take any job and he will work through the pain including that which might cause him lose his big toe nails. Also side bonus - he is totally willing to DM some campaigns and is familiar with rules.

106yij,1,2012-09-20,Do all/most engineers have to do 'bitch' work for the first few years of their careers?,Ragemon,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/106yij/do_allmost_engineers_have_to_do_bitch_work_for/,"Hey guys, I guess I should give you a little background first.  I was interning at my company, which is a structural engineering company, (I myself am an ME who just recently graduated from grad school with my masters this past may) since the end of 2007 up to the beginning of 2012.  

I basically did very little actual engineering work.  Most of the work I had done was coding, which was actually something I didn't know a damn thing about going into the job.  The most engineering work I did was when I had to make a program that could do bending moment diagrams...keep in mind that I worked on this for about a month during my internship.  The rest of the time I was coding and making a program run the way we wanted to (no engineering work here at all, just aesthetics).  I stayed here because the money was really good and the schedule was anything I wanted it to be.

This January when I was going to start searching for a full time job, they actually gave me a job offer which I accepted.  I was told that since our company is small, we could be flexible in the types of projects we get.  In the offer sheet, I was told that my duties would involve mechanical engineering, mechanical design, software development support, and experimental research.

In theory this sounded great, but so far, all that I have done seems to be intern type work.  I've had to buy stuff from online for projects, reserve cars, and manipulate a program to match some data.  I'm still doing some coding, but we are almost done with the program that we've been working on.  I've done very few engineering type things such as using Solidworks, LS-DYNA, and some other things that don't come to mind right now.  Basically, if I had to turn it into a percentage, I'd say that 90% of my time is spent doing bitch work and 10% may be engineering related work.

SO, with all that all being said, is it time for me to look for another job or is this just the process that all entry level engineers go through?

And because this post is so damn long...

**TL;DR-**I am an ME that interned at a structural engineering company for 4 years doing non-engineering work, was finally given a full time job offer in January.  Full time job duties include 90% bitch work and 10% engineering work.  Is this normal?"

At the time I was in a bad financial situation and I jumped on the opportunity. It's a ""good job"". Big company, benefits, whatever.

I've learned a lot in this job, but I plateaued about 2 years in. Now I'm in a rut. 

* I maintain the same systems I did when I started. 
* It is a bureaucracy heavy job with lots of unnecessary paperwork and little programming. 
* Management is from a different era and doesn't understand the Internet and don't value what I do. 
* The policies are draconian and prevent me from getting work done. No open source software, IE only (!!), can't use source control... and on and on. The people who set/enforce the rules don't understand them, and it's a letter-of-the-law rather than spirit-of-the-law kind of place. 
* Much of the little technical work I had to do is now being handed to offshore workers, which I am expected to hire, train and supervise.
* We are using severely outdated technology and my skills are slipping.

This makes me miserable day in and day out. I no longer do programming in my spare time because my spirit has been crushed. I think to myself ""I'll never be able to use this in my job, so why bother?""

I really, really want to leave but I'm too afraid to do anything. This is the only job I've ever had and I didn't finish school. If I leave, will anyone ever hire me again? Shouldn't I be happy to have a job at all? 

Another thing that worries me - if I go looking now I will need references and then people will find out I'm looking, and *nobody* I've seen has ever left this place."

I'm actually going to interview a few candidates and choose between them. 

My goal is not to stump this guy, or intimidate him, I just want to find out as best I can if he's going to be a good match for the business and for us working together.  His technical background is actually very strong and its likely he'll fit that part of the spot without a problem.  

What questions have you faced in an interview that you felt really allowed you to demonstrate your personality or strengths, that you wish you were asked more often?

My most memorable is when the final interviewer of a large national bank asked me for 3 weaknesses that would be relevant and a challenge to the position I was applying for.  I gave a softball answer at first, something about organization and how I overcome it - his response was ""sounds like you already solved that one, now tell me about a few that exist that you'll need to solve after you begin this position.""  It was a tough question it was intimidating but I felt my answer and how I handled the second response was actually the reason I got that job. (this isn't really the type of question I'm going to ask because I left thinking that guy was a jerk.  I also never worked directly with him, but its my most memorable interview question)

106lst,1,2012-09-20,How could I possibly link Design and Anthropology?,[deleted],AskSocialScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/106lst/how_could_i_possibly_link_design_and_anthropology/,"Hey,
First of all, I hope I'm in the right forum. If not, my apologies. I tried.
Here it goes: 
I'm currently studying Graphic Design, something I fairly good at and I believe I'd have a nice, confortable life working for design agencies after I graduate. However, I love academia: even though my current major isn't exactly what you'd call academic, I do enjoy every opportunity I have to write essays, do research and overall I think I'll always put a lot of the way I think and develop my academic research into the way I develop projects - even though the final outcome will be a visual product, everything is deeply researched and explained (even if sometimes it isn't required).
I am quite happy on my course right now (I did transfer from a very practical university before I finally came here), but do feel like I'd like to study something else in the future. After a lot of research (typical) I've realised that I really, really, like Anthropology. Everything about it interests me. I have books on the subject, I read blogs, studies. I'm particularly interest in Social and Cultural Anthropology and am seriously thinking about applying for this course once I finish my degree in design and maybe have a few years/months of experience with internships. And I'd probably be a freelances during my time at uni.

Well, I'm happy doing what I do and excited about future plans, nevertheless, I'm afraid I'll just end up being a graphic designer with an Anthropology degree because that will be easier for me. I've also thought about the fact I like social-environmental design (design stuff for people, communities, environment etc) but that works a lot better with 3D/arquitectural design than with graphic design (I've done some activists campaigns but how could I possibly make money out of that for the rest of my life?) and I maybe go from there but I'm not even sure. What kind of career could I have? I guess this is a very vague question without a specific, obvious answer for it, so I'm not really hoping to hear any job descriptions or anything, but rather to hear your thoughts on this and maybe have some ideas myself. Some people have mentioned advertising, but I feel I wouldn't really be happy spending the rest of my life designing stuff for people to buy (I know I'm a graphic design student and it's main purpose it selling products, but I believe design has a much bigger potential...). I hope I was clear enough, if not feel free to ask."

I'm a college student, and I'll be graduating in December of 2013.  I have a great job already from an internship, and I want a companion.  I want to get my bully now so that I can spend the first 2 years training and spending a lot of time with him before I work my 9-5.

That being said. This ""breeder"" I found.  The puppies are NKC registered, and I'm told they have no health problems, and the parents are healthy as well.  The grandpa is supposedly Bishop of Naptown Bullies. (google him he's gorgeous.)

However I've only been in text contact with the breeder, I've spoken for a puppy, and it all seems really great.  I'm just a bit concerned about a few things.

1.) The breeder doesn't know my name, living situation, or anything, seems only concerned with selling the pups.
2.) I'm not really familiar with American Bully's.  My mom breed AKC English, but she's super busy with life and doesn't have to help me shop for a puppy, nor does she know the breed.
3.) Naptown Bully pups go for 1500 (male) 2000 (female).  Why is the breeder selling them so cheaply if they have such a great bloodline?

Lastly, I just want a friend and companion, somebody I can workout with, take in the car, go camping, and I can still have the bully personality in a larger, more active dog than an english.  If this is a puppy mill, or not great breeder, I can still help the puppy out, what should I look for as warning signs.

** Edit** Realize my link didn't work. 
 I'm getting a male for $500 He comes with first shots and worming, papers, and I was given a chance to visit, haven't got to head over there just yet though.

**Edit 2**
Thanks for all the warnings guys! I really appreciate the feedback and it seems to be about how I feel on the issue.  What I think however, is that this lady isn't really a breeder, she's simply attempting to make some return on the female she bought for 2 grand.  At least that's what I'm hoping.

I'm going on Sunday to see the pup and living conditions.  I'll be looking at how feedings take place, how happy the puppies are, any kind of lethargy.  The mom should be there and I can look at her, and hopefully the case is I have a lady who doesn't really know what she's doing and had a litter of great pups....

On the other hand. if it's a crappy situation, then I have a serious decision to make =("

What should I do?",Hitamu,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/106i8c/i_am_still_deeply_in_love_with_my_exgirlfriend/,"Hey reddit, so this is a long story but I will try to keep this as brief as possible. I met this girl, lets call her ""Lilly"", during high-school and soon after we started dating. This continued for 4 and a half years and I consider those 4 years as the best 4 years of my life. Once we moved up to college however things got harder to manage. The short version is that Lilly started to distance herself from me during the last 2 months of our relationship due to various reasons that would not be addressed until after the break up. She started spending all of her time with another guy, lets call him John, and began acting completely different than normal. So for 2 months she spent all her time with him, started to avoid me and even sent me a text one night saying that she and John were going to go to a town 5 hours away for a night.(This of course did not happen but the severity of the situation is not lost on me.) The thing is even after all of this I still could not leave her, in the end we broke up because I told a group of strangers what had been happening between us and I lied when she asked me if I had. Eventually John found out that I lied and told Lilly that I was doing so. We had a short fight and it was finally over. Fast forward a few months and I am a changed man now. The break up has made me completely different and it has also changed her. When she returned from her internship over the summer she admitted that she was cruel to me and has never stopped hating herself for what she did. She told me she loves me but she doesn't want this to happen again so she needs time to date other people. (It is important to note that I was her first boyfriend) She is now dating John, thankfully it is going terribly between them, but every time I see her it kills me. What should I do?

This past summer I had an internship at a software dev company. It was paid, the work wasn't so bad, and it turned out that I was good enough that they offered me a job to work there after I graduate in December.

While I feel extremely lucky to have been offered a job, I don't really want to work there. I was not interested in the work and I did not enjoy it. When I took the internship, I was really just looking to get some experience and to figure out what I like and what I'm good at--I made this really clear to my employers that I was there for a primarily learning experience, and was not really interested in making a career.

The issue is that I've been mailed an employment contract. If I sign it now, I technically shouldn't be applying for other jobs and attending job fairs for something I'm more interested in, and I believe that other employers will be unlikely to hire me if they know I've already signed a contract. If I wait before returning the contract, I'm worried that they may rescind their offer or at least annoy them. 

I've tried talking to my parents about this -- my dad thinks that I should wait and try for something better (he also thinks that I deserve to be paid more, but hey) and my mom thinks I should accept the job because at least I'll have some guaranteed security for when I'm done with school in four months, and I should start applying for new jobs after I've started working there.

There are ups and downs to both sides clearly, I'm wondering if anyone can elaborate on the legal ramifications of signing one of these contracts and then applying elsewhere, or for waiting (how bad is it if I wait a month..?). They haven't given me a ""due-date"" but I feel slightly pressured by them to return it asap.

All thoughts welcome, and thanks."

I moved from Canada to North Carolina this past January for a job at a large engineering firm.  I graduated with a masters degree a little over a year ago.  My job pays well and is secure.  I have no debt and am aggressively saving for a down payment.

The Plan:

My company runs an internship program where new university grads complete three work terms at different locations around the county; each is six months in length.  They all say it is a huge headache to find an apartment and move their stuff each rotation.  I want to buy a large house, live in one room, and rent the remaining rooms to interns as they rotate through my location.

The Problem:

Since I have only been in the US for about eight months, I have a very short credit history.  I contacted a few mortgage loan officers (only large banks so far) and they explained that without a two-year record of employment, housing, and credit history, they are unwilling to work with me.

The Question:

What options are available to me?  Try to find a smaller lender that can work exceptions to these types of rules?  Try to get a mortgage through a Canadian bank?"

10666k,1,2012-09-19,Address match on ID Requirement for Parcel Pick-up,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/10666k/address_match_on_id_requirement_for_parcel_pickup/,"I've moved a lot recently for school and internships, and I've lived in a lot of places temporarily (e.g. 4 or 8 months).

Since I wasn't a permanent resident in most of these places, I'm not required to get any of my ID changed.

The requirement for the address on my ID to match that on any parcel I receive is a pain in the ass, and seems to do little to prevent theft. I have the slip that says ""A parcel has been delivered"" and a piece of ID with a matching name. This should be more than enough to prove it's my parcel. 

Note, if I was trying to steal someone's identity, I would be looking for documents, which come in regular mail and go in a mail box (thus do not have to be picked up), not parcels.

Even though I have found permanent residence now, and I have got my IDs switched over, it takes time for the IDs to come in the mail, so I don't have any photo ID right now with a matching address. There sometimes is the option of using a bank statement, utility bill,  etc. along with a photo ID with a non-matching address, but since I just moved in, none of these will be issued for some time. The parcel will only be held for five days.

I'm hoping my lease will be sufficient to pick up my parcel, but not everyone has a lease. I know for a fact that some live at temporary residences where everything is ""under the table"". They receive no utility bills, bank statements, or anything else at an address (except for an occasional parcel/letter), and they never sign a lease. They just wrote their landlord a cheque. What would one be expected to do in that situation to pick up a parcel? 

I know people go through so much worse injustices than me, but this is an unnecessary pain in the ass.

Some express disgust for Dinoland due to the tacky appearance and general lack of rides. However, Imagineers have filled this area with details and gems. Chester and Hester’s Dinorama located right off the highway 498 and the highway is the subject of today's post. Most people write [this Highway 498 sign](http://i.imgur.com/8eHuK.jpg) off as purely decorative, but this is Disney.  Disney’s Animal Kingdom has a special relationship with 498. The number 498 represents Disney’s Animal Kingdom’s opening day on April (22) 1998. (Sidenote: April 22 is Earth Day which is fitting for Disney's Animal Kingdom)

The posts will feature a topic like the Tower of Terror and you guys get to “reimagine” the ride, your way!

",Miss_anthropyy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/109x0d/phds_of_reddit_i_want_to_join_you_but_im_torn_its/,"(This became way longer than I intended, I apologize; don't feel obligated to read the whole thing!)

I graduated in August with my BA in political science.  (I’ve been in school part-time for around two years now; I finished with an internship and independent studies, so my coursework ended spring semester.)  I did an elective honors thesis that I'm presenting at a conference in November.  My father is a PhD and my mother used to be an elementary school teacher, so education has always been highly valued in my family.  

I really love political science, and doing the research for my thesis was one of the best, most fulfilling things I've ever done.  I absolutely adore my major, but I'm not a big fan of partisan politics - I prefer looking at the bigger picture, the overlying framework, theories and themes.  I want to do something that has a practical application, but doesn't neglect this perspective.

My plan has been to pursue an MPP, aiming for a career as a public policy analyst.  However, what with student loans, that's looking more and more difficult financially.  I know I'll have a better chance of getting funding if I apply for a PhD program.  (My grades are high, my resume’s competitive, etc.)  As my one doctoral candidate friend put it, ""For your master's, you pay them $30,000.  For a PhD, they pay you!""  Additionally, while I know I don't *need* a PhD for my desired career, I don't see myself being happy with anything less than the highest degree in my field.  I love my research and I think it's important.  What I really want is to be a ""political scientist,"" but of course that's not an actual job title. 

I've been talking with a friend of mine who's in the poli sci PhD program at an Ivy League school about my options. I'm thinking that maybe a doctoral program wouldn't be so bad after all.  I'm hesitant because I don't really want to be a professor.  My dad teaches an awful lot of classes at once and seems to do comparatively little research, but of course plenty of professors do as little teaching as possible and focus on their research.  I've tutored before and teaching is quite rewarding but it's just not what I'd want my life's focus to be.  But I wouldn't mind immersing myself in research, and teaching a couple classes on the side.

Right now, I'm thinking I'll apply to a doctoral program, do my master's work there, and see where life takes me.  I guess the feeling I'm getting from my non-academically minded friends (and my parents) is ""That's a lot of work... are you sure you can handle it?""  (Thanks for the vote of confidence, right?)  It’s a big commitment, but having seen what I have of the “real world,” I don’t really want to leave academia.  I miss school!  And it’s not about avoiding reality or anything… I miss learning, I miss reading and writing and researching and all of it!  I don’t see myself being happy anywhere else.  

Ugh, I don't know, I'm torn, and I don't know enough PhDs to really discuss this with.  Help me, Reddit.  How did you make this choice?

109trg,1,2012-09-21,Why we need this,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/109trg/why_we_need_this/,"So I've been going through a difficult time for the past several weeks. Fapping about once a day, when I'd been doing so well before then. Just yesterday and today I began to realize something. I must start with a story.

So yesterday was the career fair at my college. I was dreading this day for weeks, because I knew I had to go, but the lazy/socially-awkward person in me was fighting so hard to find a way for me not to go. I put off preparations like setting up my resume and calling my dad to ask him to bring me a tie for this reason. I figured that once the day came I wouldn't be prepared to go and wouldn't be able to, so I wouldn't. But then I made one of the best decisions I ever made. I was sitting in a physics discussion with a group of guys in my major that I had talked to a little before, but still wouldn't really call them friends. (BTW I have made almost no friends since I started college, so this was new for me.) We got to talking about the career fair and I said that I might not go because I didn't have a tie. Then one of the guys told me he had a spare tie and would be willing to lend it to me. I underwent a rapid change over the next hour. We walked to his dorm to get his tie, talking the whole way, I said thanks, and walked back to my dorm. I have never felt so confident in myself than I did yesterday. I updated my resume (like a boss), bought a padfolio (like a boss), got dressed up all fancy-like (like a boss), and went to that career fair feeling like I had the ability to do anything. I got two potential internships for next summer and never lost that confidence. 

I didn't have the urge to fap once yesterday. The thought didn't even cross my mind. I was too good for it. I have a few reasons for partaking in NoFap, but the prime one is to get more confidence. So I was surprised when it wasn't NoFap that led to confidence, but the other way around.

So I woke up this morning feeling like any other day. Lethargic, worried, socially awkward, unconfident. And you know what I did? I fapped. I realized that the reason I fap isn't to satisfy sexual desire/tension. It's to shield myself from my emotions. When I feel down or depressed or unfaithful in my ability to do anything, I fap, because it provides momentary relief from those feelings. But when I'm done, I feel even worse than when I started. So this results in a chain reaction of building negative emotions that lead to more and more fapping. It's a vicious cycle.

This is why some people can fap casually without consequence. They don't fap to shield themselves. They fap for the natural reasons. It's not like that for us. We can't fap because it lowers our confidence, while it doesn't for them.

And the most important lesson is this:

NoFap doesn't lead to confidence. Confidence leads to NoFap, which will give you more confidence to continue. 

For those of you who are dependent on NoFap to magically heal you, WAKE UP. You need to fix yourself before you can start NoFap and do it right."

I recently dropped out of Syracuse University(studying computer science) due to financial reasons and now I am at home looking for a job to start saving for loans. =[ The job search has been terrible; not even a rejection letter or email (except from one source) has been sent back to me. 

As for my skillset: 

Recently, writing has taken a fancy to my interests, and I've even begun writing a small book that I would like to publish sometime soon. I've been searching for writing jobs, and can submit an iota of my work on request. 

Music is something that I want to get into, hopefully sooner than later. I'm teaching myself how to play guitar now, and it's working off a bit. I'm no Hendrix... yet haha. I also make instrumentals on Garageband and Logic Pro 9 that range from hip-hop to meditative, to just plain chill. If you'd like to hear what I'm working with, I'd be glad to share a few tracks with you. I love music and want to spread my sounds all over. 

Video games are also a huge hobby of mine. I currently record gameplay footage and post it on YouTube, although I've just begun so the channel isn't quite booming yet. Speaking of the YouTube channel, I make videos about random topics, some serious and some with a hint of wisdom hidden in there. Finally, concerning videos, I'm a skit writer, so I have a few skit ideas that I would love to expand on if I had a team of people I could work on them with. [You can check out my YouTube channel here](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheJeeTeam)

On a website called Fiverr, a user can create several small time gigs that people pay five dollars for. My profile on there is increasing in status. My most popular gig involves creating a happy birthday song for buyers (after they give me a bit of info on the subject of the song). I've done quite a few; they are short and comical and buyers love them. [You can check out my Fiverr profile here](http://fiverr.com/eazyryder)

Philosophy is a subject that I am studying on my own. I have always loved the universal ideas of philosophy as a child, and this summer, after realizing I probably wouldn't return to school, began to read ""Introduction to Philosophy: Classical and Contemporary Readings"" by John Perry, Michael Bratman, et al. I've also taken quite a few philosophy classes whilst still in school, and I've retained a fair amount of information from them. I'm not saying it makes me a reknown philosophy guru haha, but I do wish to expand on that knowledge myself, and would love to intern at a philosophical institution or something of the like if possible. I'm a huge conceptual thinker and I love to discuss ideas with other people that go beyond abortion and gay rights, i.e. something with more of a worldly meaning to it.

I'm innovative and quick to learn any new skills needed for a job. If the job requires a quick lesson on a program or a physical task, I can pick it up easily within a week or two, depending on it's complexity. I'm self-reliant too and can be trusted to work alone and efficiently. 

If there is anything else you would like to inquire, please don't hesitate to ask me.

Thanks for reading this. If you are an employer finding something you can utilize or looking for someone to whom you can teach skills to and depend on, look no further because you've found one. If you are someone who can offer me a bit of help on where to look for jobs that fit my persona, please please please help me out. I would greatly appreciate it. =]"
109pjj,4,2012-09-21,I'm being spied on by my parents when I'm in the basement. What can I do to stop this invasion of privacy?,JPannullo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/109pjj/im_being_spied_on_by_my_parents_when_im_in_the/,"So 19m here and my dad is one of those paranoid guys that has to make sure if his houses are alright. So what he did was put cameras outside the house to make sure that no one tries to break in.

But recently it has gotten out of hand. Just last month I noticed a camera set up looking at the back door. This upset me, but since my family goes to Florida monthly and leaves me to house sit, I was fine with it. It unsettled me, but I decided to just hang out in the basement most of the time anyway.

Today I was in the basement which I have transformed into a mini ""man cave"" and I look up and see a camera pointed right at my favorite couch that I sit in most of the time I'm down there.

This was extremely unsettling to me. It just feels like it is really over stepping the line. I have thought of bringing it up to him but he is a violent man and gets excited really easy so it makes it difficult to have a peaceful debate about something he is doing that can be considered ""wrong"".

Right now I am staying at my grandpa's house and my family doesn't know why.

So, what should I do? Should I grow some balls and talk to them or just deal with it?

tl;Dr: my dad has a camera pointed strait at my spot I sit in most of the day. Should I tell him it is wrong?

Edit: my family is moving out in three years ( when my brother graduates high school) and said they would give me the house and all I would have to do is pay rent and utilitiesuntil I can by it from my dad.

I put a lot of work into that house, it just doesn't feel right to leave.

Also, I work minimum wage for two days and intern in I.T. for three, I don't have the money to move out"

* We've known each other for about a year, since he interns for someone my dad works with. 
* We're both part of a sports team where the practices are at night.
* He seems really concerned with my safety, especially because I have to walk halfway across campus (half a mile or so) by myself at night after practice, because everyone else, including him, lives in the opposite direction. He's even walked me home several times. None of my other friends, male or female, have done that. 
* He asks me often (sometimes several times a night) if I need help with my math, because he's a total math/science geek and I'm, well, not. Even if I say I'm good, he'll press me to be sure.
* Part of our team (seven or eight people) went and got dinner last night, including me and him. He gave me some of his food and finished the parts of mine I didn't want. 
* He's started hugging me longer and tighter than he used to, and more often. 

I thought all of these were just signs of being good friends, but I've talked about him to my mother and a few of my friends, and they all hint that he likes me. I'm not entirely convinced, so what do you guys think? "

[This article](http://www.avclub.com/articles/unpaid-black-swan-interns-now-trying-to-spark-an-i,83785/#disqus_thread)'s comment section seems to be in favor of the interns suing Fox Searchlight for what a lot of them feel to be a practice of ""taunting a dog with a steak.""

Being in college, with hopes of entering the film and TV industries, instructors stress heavily that all students should take internships, if only just for the sake of making connections and gaining experience. Most likely, this would mean going off to live in New York or L.A. for a summer, not making any money while spending long hours just making coffee and copies. 

To anyone who has done an unpaid internship, was it worth it?"

I was a communications major and film studies minor. Teaching English is an excuse for me to live abroad and experience other cultures but it isn't what I want to do for a career. Film/Television production is. I don't have much experience however (only 1 internship with a local tv station back in college and working as an extra) and I don't have any contacts. I'm not too concerned about moving out to LA and networking to find that first PA job but I'm wondering if waiting until my mid-late 20s will make it nearly impossible to get started on the career ladder.

Please be as honest as possible. As much as I'd like to experience Japan before settling down, I'd easily put it aside if I knew it would screw up my entry-level job prospects in the film/tv industry.

Thanks everyone!


P.S. If you couldn't tell, I love traveling and living abroad. The US will always be my home base but it would be amazing to find a way to merge those interests with my film career.

Thought others who struggle through certain relationship issues might find out somemore about themselves. 

Original Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/108jzz/nice_guy_symdrome_very_important_issue_for_fappers/

I'm currently reading a book about Nice Guy Symdrome. The author lists many characteristics of ""Nice Guys"" that i'd like to share with you. I used to be a ""Nice Guy"" before my NoFap challenge - i'm changing now. I think that you guys will identify yourself with many of those characteristics. One detail that the author doesn't know: ""Nice Guy Syndrom"" is TOTALLY related to fapping. I thank God and NoFap for saving me of this shit. Here we go:

Nice Guys are givers. Nice Guys frequently state that it makes them feel good to give to others. These men believe their generosity is a sign of how good they are and will make other people love and appreciate them.

Nice Guys fix and caretake. If a person has a problem, has a need, is angry, depressed or sad, Nice Guys will frequently attempt to solve or fix the situation (usually without being asked).

Nice Guys seek approval from others. A universal trait of the Nice Guy Syndrome is the seeking of validation from others. Everything a Nice Guy does or says is at some level calculated to gain someone's approval or avoid disapproval. This is especially true in their relationships with women.

Nice Guys avoid conflict. Nice Guys seek to keep their world smooth. To do this, they avoid doing things that might rock the boat or upset anyone.

Nice Guys believe they must hide their perceived flaws and mistakes. These men are afraid that others will get mad at them, shame them, or leave them if some mistake or shortcoming is exposed.

Nice Guys seek the ""right"" way to do things. Nice Guys believe there is a key to having a happy, problem-free life. They are convinced that if they can only figure out the right way to do everything, nothing should ever go wrong.

Nice Guys repress their feelings. Nice Guys tend to analyze rather than feel. They may see feelings as a waste of time and energy. They frequently try to keep their feelings on an even keel.

Nice Guys often try to be different from their fathers. Many Nice Guys report having unavailable, absent, passive, angry, philandering, or alcoholic fathers. It is not unusual for these men to make a decision at some point in their lives to try to be 180 degrees different from Dad.

Nice Guys are often more comfortable relating to women than to men. Due to their childhood conditioning, many Nice Guys have few male friends. Nice Guys frequently seek the approval of women and convince themselves they are different from other men. They like to believe that they are not selfish, angry, or abusive — traits they link to ""other"" men.

Nice Guys have difficulty making their needs a priority. These men often feel that it is selfish to put their needs first. They believe it is a virtue to put others' needs ahead of their own.

Nice Guys often make their partner their emotional center. Many Nice Guys report that they are only happy if their partner is happy. Therefore they will often focus tremendous energy on their intimate relationships.

What's Wrong With Being A Nice Guy?

We might be tempted to minimize the problem of the Nice Guy Syndrome. After all, how can being nice be such a bad thing? We might even chuckle at the Marvin Milquetoast behaviors of these men as portrayed in comic strips and television sitcoms. Since men already represent an easy target in our culture, the caricature of a sensitive guy might be an object of amusement rather than concern.

Nice Guys themselves frequently have a difficult time grasping the depth and seriousness of their beliefs and behaviors. When I begin working with these passively pleasing men, almost without exception, they all ask, ""What is wrong with being a Nice Guy?"" Having picked up this book and puzzled over the title, you may be wondering the same thing.

By giving these men the label Nice Guy, I'm not so much referring to their actual behavior, but to their core belief system about themselves and the world around them. These men have been conditioned to believe that if they are ""nice,"" they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life.

The term Nice Guy is actually a misnomer because Nice Guys are often anything but nice. Here are some Not-So-Nice Traits of Nice Guys:

Nice Guys are dishonest. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest . Nice Guys are secretive. Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, ""If at first you don't succeed, hide the evidence.""

Nice Guys are compartmentalized. Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.

Nice Guys are manipulative. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.

Nice Guys are controlling. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.

Nice Guys give to get . Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc. Nice Guys often report feeling frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.

Nice Guys are passive-aggressive. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.

Nice Guys are full of rage. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.

Nice Guys are addictive. Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.

Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying ""no,"" ""stop,"" or ""I'm going to."" They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the problems they are experiencing.

Nice Guys are frequently isolated. Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.

Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing. This behavior is often the result of the Nice Guy's childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. Unfortunately, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time putting out fires and managing crises.

Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships. Though Nice Guys often put tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, their intimate relationships are frequently a source of struggle and frustration. For example: l Nice Guys are often terrible listeners because they are too busy trying to figure out how to defend themselves or fix the other person's problem. l Because of their fear of conflict, they are frequently dishonest and are rarely available to work all the way through a problem. l It is not unusual for Nice Guys to form relationships with partners whom they believe to be ""projects"" or ""diamonds in the rough."" When these projects don't polish up as expected, Nice Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness.

Nice Guys have issues with sexuality. Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, I have yet to meet one who isn't either dissatisfied with his sex life, has a sexual dysfunction (can't get or maintain an erection, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.).

Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful. The majority of Nice Guys I've met have been talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to their full potential. ""

There's been a thought burning in the back of my mind for quite some time now, and I thought I'd get some opinions from the community.

Is there more to CS? Obviously I know the answer is yes, as there are a huge number of problems that can be investigated and researched. But I have a nagging feeling that if I just settle for my Bachelor's, I'm relegating myself to a life as a software engineer. I currently work at a pretty good company as a co-op engineer, but the work isn't as fulfilling as I'd like.

I've started thinking that I should use my CS knowledge and thought processes to supplement my venture into another field. My dream job is to be an astronomer, and I feel like my CS background could do some good in that field, since it deals with such large quantities of data. As I thought about it more, it occurred to me that a CS background would be invaluable in almost any science related field.

In closing, what are your thoughts on how to get into a more research oriented position, rather than just writing corporate software? One drawback for me is that I'm 26 and I have a family to feed, so starting out as a research assistant or unpaid intern isn't really an option.

I want to take control of this aspect of my life.  I am starting school again on monday (barely graduated once, with shitty grades, no internships, and no jobs ever panned out).

10985q,0,2012-09-21,Does Reddit make you more cynical?,CitizenShips,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10985q/does_reddit_make_you_more_cynical/,"Hey there. I've only recently started going on Reddit on a consistent basis (Heyo internship), and recently I started noticing myself becoming a lot more cynical. 

Now, when I say cynical, I don't mean that in a ""suddenly everything is clear to me"" way. I mean humanity's prospects for the future look genuinely bleaker than they did previous to my Redditing. I realized that I was getting a large amount of my information about the world from Reddit, which made me wonder if it wasn't the medium through which I was receiving the information that was modifying my outlook. I just don't understand it. Our technology is amazing, and we have SO MUCH to look forward to, yet all I hear about is fighting, riots, slanderous corporations, and corrupt politicians.

Now there are some confounding factors that could be coming into play here. First of all, I don't normally keep up with news. Most of what I learn about current events (Before Reddit, anyway) is through conversation with others, after which I research the information by my own means. I've always tried to maintain a non-biased stance on new issues, and for that reason the only news source I ever trusted was Al-Jazeerah. However, even with that, I rarely watch formal news sources. So maybe this is just a result of me finally exposing myself to what everyone else already sees.

But coming into Reddit, I was barraged by daily updates on current events. Even today, I've seen at least 5 posts about the people who died in the Pakistan riots. And it just makes me wonder: Is this really what I need to see on a daily basis? If I needed to be barraged by tragedy and death, I'd turn on a major news station. 

Maybe it's just poor timing. After all, the riots in the Middle East (Which I do NOT want to discuss here. I am sick of hearing about it, and there are other places to talk about it) are a fairly significant event, and the presidential elections always bring out the worst in people. 

Anyway, what are your thoughts? Do you think Reddit makes people more cynical? Or is it just the news itself that is depressing? Or do you disagree with all of it, and think that things aren't really that bad?

TL;DR: Never kept abreast of current events through any more than casual means until starting to frequent Reddit last week, after which I became noticeably more cynical of society. Wondering if it's Reddit."
1097t2,6,2012-09-21,"Might have an opportunity for an internship at Google, advice and tips greatly appreciated!",Exasm,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1097t2/might_have_an_opportunity_for_an_internship_at/,"Hi fellow programmers, I come here yet again for your wise words!

At the moment, I work part-time as a webdeveloper for a company in the Netherlands and I'm a CE student. For the last 2 years, I've been working with a lot of national and international big clients at my current job. Which still amazes me everyday, people are always shocked when we tell them the age of our programmers, 20 years old. I've been doing mainly webdevelopment and a bit of C, C++, C# and Java at school.

Now, through this job, I got to know to know someone, who now works for Google. Thinking 'what the heck, trying never hurts', I decided to email him, asking if he could set me up with an internship at Google next year September. I was shocked when I got told the ""big news"". He is willing to set me up with other contacts at Google. And another thing: we(the company where I work), got pretty exclusive access to one of the Google APIs(due to privacy, I don't think I can tell which API). With access to this API I've got a headstart on competition, and I basically have a year to use it to my full extinct. 

I'm still shocked and amazed at this opportunity and I really want to make this happen. Getting that internship is my dream, and I will do anything to get it.

I don't even have any questions -yet-, I am simply looking for advice, tips, wise words, anything really. Even though I've been working with big clients, I'm still a rookie in the business game and probably even the programming game as well. You might even say, I'm just very lucky.

So, wise ones, please share your wisdom, it is greatly appreciated!

The service has a relatively low awareness/market penetration rate. We recently paid and had a website made, and did all the copy ourselves. We did not however, SEO the site. Soon after the website was finished, they shifted my focus from creative support to sales, and I went into long days of cold calling businesses. I'm not adverse to cold calling, however, this can't be the only way we should be generating leads. Foot canvasing seems to have a very low rate of success as well.

I don't like the idea of ""giving up"", but there is a lot of pressure on me to provide more leads via calling, and it's been very hard to get owners or CFO's to agree to even a meeting to learn about our service, which is *free* for the client.

I don't know what to do. I've tried researching cold calling techniques. There's got to be more to it than this, and I'm starting to get frustrated and it's affecting my work ethic and my call productivity. 

I've made suggestions that we should try and generate some leads through other channels, or SEO the site (to which the response was ""we just wanted the website because we just needed to at least have one"") but as I'm relatively new to the concept of social media and blogs for B2B marketing, what should I suggest for other ways I can spend my time to help grow leads, beyond sitting in front of a phone for 6 hours a day?

The service is a really good service for some, and doesn't work for others, but we go into the meetings with our clients to provide that information for them, not to try and hook them on something they don't need. I like the company, but I can't see myself doing this any longer once I graduate."

I'm currently 18 (19 in bout a month), never dated before, never kissed a girl and a sophomore in college. The problem comes from my insane courseload haha. I attend a top 30 (overall) university and have a full ride to this institution. Finished my first year with a 4.0 and was lucky enough to intern with Merrill Lynch in their special situations group within the middle market proprietary credit investing desk. 

I was brought up on the notion that having a girlfriend at such a young age will bring unnecessary distractions and cause my academics to fall. However, It is slightly depressing when I see my friends happy with their partners.

What do you guys think? Should I attempt to date as of right now? I need to keep my 4.0 since I'm looking to get into investment banking focusing on energy/natural gas upon graduation. Bulge bracket firms won't even look at you unless you have a 3.8 or higher haha. 

I also have officer positions in 3 student organizations as well as am a resident advisor for one of our honor dorms. I just simply don't have time.. and feel like even if I got a girl, I wouldn't be able to spend quality time with her. Yet on the other hand... It is slightly depressing that I have never kissed a girl haha. 

What do you guys think?"

1090ea,3,2012-09-21,I [26/m] fell in love - while being in a relationship of 8 yrs (26/f),thrwy08,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1090ea/i_26m_fell_in_love_while_being_in_a_relationship/,"Hey Reddit,

After 8 years of being in a relationship with my girlfriend, I made the mistake of meeting a friend from university who I knew for a couple of years. We went out, had something to eat, I walked her back to her appartment and we continued the night at her place drinking wine and talking. At the end of it, I needed to get home but there was no transportation service so I asked her to crash her couch to which replied that I could as well sleep in her bed. So we slept in her bed, nothing happenend (that was the deal) and the next morning we parted in a friendly - not awkward - way.
Since then, my mind is constantly thinking about her. I know exactly that I fell in love. 
But here comes the problem - my actual relationship of 8 years. We've been together for two years and then had to be on a long distance relationship the last 6 years. Right around two months ago she cut all her ties in her hometown and moved over to my new city and began her internship. We even moved together in a new appartment.
Our relationship was always very peaceful, I never cheated her and we've never had the ""relationship on rocks"". But the last 2 years I grew kind of tired of her and was bored. Silly things led to arguments which frustrated me because of redundancy. And right now I have problems showing love and affection towards her, which even saddens her.
So... I know, I'm a total scumbag. But I need your advice and experience here. Have you ever been in a situation as this before? What would you do? Leave her and try to find new love although it might end up with an apocalypse?
Stick to her and ignore all those warm feelings of new love until they become dull and I continue my life in the known way?

[tl;dr] After 8 yrs of relationship I accidentally fell in love with a new woman. I'm scum. What to do and how?"

After a couple of hours I got an awesome comprehensive answer! I was expecting for my question to be deleted, or at most simply responded to with a canned response by the office intern, but nup -  here it is:

&gt;**Me** Hi, I was just wondering, is all ABC content free to download? Since it is a publicly funded broadcaster, is the content public domain for Australians?

&gt;**ABC** Good question and worth a thorough answer! We have a lot of radio and TV programs available online for free download and even more is available to stream online through the website or via ABC iView for television content.

&gt;However, not all of the content that is broadcast on air by the ABC is available for download online. There are a variety of reasons why this is the case that revolve around the copyright and licensing of content.

&gt;Unfortunately it doesn’t follow that just because the ABC is publicly funded that any of the content it broadcasts will be in the public domain.

&gt;Public domain is a very specific legal state of copyright which has international and creative implications. If something is in the public domain it has essentially forfeited copyright so that anyone can use it in any way and for any purpose.

&gt;Please also note that the ABC doesn’t own the copyright to all the content it broadcasts. In many cases the ABC licenses content from other broadcasters (such as the BBC for programs such as Doctor Who and NPR for programs such as This American Life) or from production companies (such as Zapruder’s Other Films for programs such as Gruen Planet).

&gt;We also need to pay licences for other things such as the music that is used in programs or promotional material, this is why some TV promos are geo-blocked on YouTube and many podcasts do not include music on iTunes.

&gt;Increasingly the content licenses are extending beyond just on air broadcast in Australia to other uses such as online streaming, replays on digital channels (such as ABC2) and sales in ABC Shop - just to name a few.

I've heard this speculation before, but nothing to this specificity.
Here is the actual post:
The following is a list of dead people connected with Bill Clinton: 
 
-James McDougal Clinton's convicted Whitewater partner died of an apparent heart attack, while in solitary confinement. He was a key witness in Ken Starr's investigation. 
Mary Mahoney - A former White House intern was murdered July 1997 at a Starbucks Coffee Shop in Georgetown. The murder happened just after she was to go public with her story of sexual harassment in the White House.  
-Vince Foster Former White House councelor, and colleague of Hillary Clinton at Little Rock's Rose law firm. Died of a gunshot wound to the head, ruled a suicide.  
-Ron Brown Secretary of Commerce and former DNC Chairman. Reported to have died by impact in a plane crash. A pathologist close to the investi-gation reported that there was a hole in the top of Brown's skull resembling a gunshot wound. At the time of his death Brown was being investigated, and spoke publicly of his willingness to cut a deal with prosecutors.  
-C. Victor Raiser II - &amp; - Montgomery Raiser Major players in the Clinton fund raising organization died in a private plane crash in July 1992.  
-Paul Tulley Democratic National Committee Political Director found dead in a hotel room in Little Rock, September 1992. Described by Clinton as a ""Dear friend and trusted advisor"".  
-Ed Willey Clinton fund raiser, found dead November 1993 deep in the woods in Virginia of a gunshot wound to the head. Ruled a suicide. Ed Willey died on the same day his wife Kathleen Willey claimed Bill Clinton groped her in the oval office in the White House. Ed Willey was involved in several Clinton fund raising events.  
-Jerry Parks Head of Clinton's gubernatorial security team in Little Rock. Gunned down in his car at a deserted intersection outside Little Rock. Park's son said his father was building a dossier on Clinton. He allegedly threatened to reveal this information. After he died the files were mysteriously removed from his house.  
-James Bunch Died from a gunshot suicide. It was reported that he had a ""Black Book"" of people containing names of influential people who visited prostitutes in Texas and Arkansas.  
-James Wilson Was found dead in May 1993 from an apparent hanging suicide. He was reported to have ties to Whitewater.  
-Kathy Ferguson Ex-wife of Arkansas Trooper Danny Ferguson died in May 1994 was found dead in her living room with a gunshot to her head. It was ruled a suicide even though there were several packed suitcases, as if she was going somewhere. Danny Ferguson was a co-defendant along with Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones lawsuit. Kathy Ferguson was a possible corroborating witness for Paula Jones.  
-Bill Shelton Arkansas State Trooper and fiancee of Kathy Ferguson. Critical of the suicide ruling of his fiancee, he was found dead in June, 1994 of a gunshot wound also ruled a suicide at the gravesite of his fiancee.  
-Gandy Baugh Attorney for Clinton friend Dan Lassater died by jumping out a window of a tall building January, 1994. His client was a convicted drug distributor.

108wte,10,2012-09-21,How did any of you break into project management?,Fantasysage,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/108wte/how_did_any_of_you_break_into_project_management/,"So here is where I am now:

 * Mid 20's
 * Business and technology management degree from a *very* good school
 * Landed a job 1 year out of college (been here 18 months) as 'support'. I ended up being a full time sysadmin, and through trial and error ended up administrating a windows domain, 100 end users, exchange, vmware, etc. Got that down right now and keeping everything alive is a lot easier than it was when I walked in the door. I still use a lot of google-fu (more than I should)
 * Prior job experience is a few unrelated internships and 4 years of part time onsite installation and relocation work.

Pretty much I feel like I am going to stagnate here. Environment is toxic, no budget, no policies (I make them and no one enforced them so I stopped wasting my time), no chain of command, nothing. Sales rules, operations drools might as well be our motto. I have no certs and I suck pretty hard at book studying. I choked my way through a CCENT book to get a better grasp on networking but never bothered with practicing for the test. 

Where the fuck would you go from here. I eventually want to get into more of a project management role. But I know that is 10 years of experience away. I think I might look to get a Jr. Sysadmin job at a larger company with rules and such but that would most definitely represent a MAJOR pay cut. 

Any ideas?

EDIT: 

For what is is worth things I have done (other than straight tech):

 * Gathering quotes and comparing vendors
 * Acting as interim office manager when office manager is away. Dealing with facilities, electrical, contractors, etc.
 * Accomplished an office move and all the bullshit that entails
 * Open and closed a satellite office
 * Dealt with the building flooding, and a lot of power losses
 * Been the point of contact for shit going tits up for almost 2 years"

Longtime lurker, full-time law student here.

I have never had any remarkable trouble meeting women, but I have had an extraordinarily hard time interviewing for internships and jobs within the legal community.  Yesterday, I had an interview with a law firm, and in digging up research on the interviewing partner, I found out he graduated from law school the same year as my mentor from back home.

""Total douche,"" said my mentor.  ""Be cool, be polite, but if they suck, don't waste your time.""

I don't know how mutually exclusive being alpha and beta is, but it's safe to say that I'd been more alpha when it came to my social scene, and totally beta in a job interview setting.

During the interview, I sit down with a male and a female, and I employed the same sort of mannerisms I usually use when talking to girls I meet: (1) penetrating eye contact, (2) gap-filling laughter, and (3) unexpected responses to shit tests (for example, I brought them an updated resume, then made them spot the differences instead of pointing them out myself).

Now, I'm not sure if this is the kind of tactic that can cross into any industry, into any office, or is just specific to this firm.  But I do know that it worked, because this morning I found a job offer in my inbox.

Strangely enough, my law school held a Career Services event where they invited hiring partners from 5 different firms, and they all said the same thing: ""INTERVIEWING FOR A JOB IS LIKE DATING: IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING A GOOD CONNECTION AND LEAVING A GOOD MEMORY IN THEIR HEADS.""

TAKEAWAYS:

1. If you're good at job interviews but suck at approaching, try using the same charm that you have there in a social setting. 

2. The inverse may be true.  Related to yesterday's daygame v. nightgame debate, the daygame crowd is much more likely to be successful with this interview style.

3. Being outcome-specific is going to make you lose.  

4. Women, like employers, don't have to be put up on a pedestal.  They all take monster shits, they all have at least 30 people who all think they're assholes, and (MOST IMPORTANTLY) they're all capable of being impressed.

5. Do not have the presumption that these people and everyone you meet are great.  Instead, have the presumption that they're just people. Holding that presumption gives you a lot more confidence than giving people undue respect. 

POST-SCRIPT: I'm declining the offer.

108mk4,0,2012-09-21,Uhh I'm not sure if I have adhd,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/108mk4/uhh_im_not_sure_if_i_have_adhd/,"Sorry, I really feel like this sub reddit gets a lot of questions like this and that it takes away from the value of the content that is posted here, but I'd rather get a solid answer before seeing a doctor(also if you know a better sub that I could post this to I would rather it be posted there I'm just not aware of it right now).

So here's the thing, I've read your stories and symptoms and I kind of feel like I have some.  Like when people say that their thoughts are constantly changing, that happens to me but in a different way.  Like my thoughts bounce off what I see, and associations of what I see, but I can keep a connection between all those thoughts.  Like today I saw a professor and I know he deals with internships, so I thought about how I want to intern in a different state.  Then I thought about getting a place there, or staying at my families place (which is about 45 minutes away by car).  My thoughts then bounced to biking there, and whether or not I could bike from my families place, or should I have a car, and if I don't have a car my parents would have to drop me off or pick me up if something were to happen and I couldn't do that to them (it's 5 hours away from my hometown, so a 10 hour total trip if they were to pick me up).

Also it seems to happen most notably when I'm in class or group meetings.  Like I always draw something when I'm in those situations.  Trees, people are the main things I draw when I'm bored, and if you've seen my notes from both they are filled with drawing of random stuff, or random song quotes or what have you.

Also I feel like I forget to do a lot of little things, such as send out emails to people I really need to, until I am absolutely reminded to.  I do scheduling for events on my campus and seeing whether or not people can see work, and typically I know about them for 2-3 weeks in advance but only send out the emails asking if they can work 2-3 days in advance.  If there is something better to do, my mind automatically goes to that thing and I start doing it (like visiting reddit).

The final thing is that I can't really sit still without doing anything.  I bounce my feet, I tap my pen, I click my pen.  If I'm in a car listening to music I'm slapping my knees to the drum beat.  People must think I'm obnoxious but I can't help it, sitting still just hasn't been what I've been about.

Also the final, final note is that back in high school I thought I had adhd, and my principals thought something was up.  I approached my parents and told them, and they just said that I was trying to get the medicine (which honestly I've never tried) and was just being lazy.  My principals came up to a teacher/coach of mine and asked if there was anything wrong with me.  He just said I was playing them for a fool, because people think I'm smart.

So I'm sorry for the length of this post, and for the post in general, but I want an opinion.  I was going to set up an appointment to my doctor and talk to him about it, but I don't want to waste my parents money if I don't really have to (i.e. I'm just being lazy or whatever).  Any insight would be very much appreciated.

Thank-you for your time and have a good day/night/afternoon/whatever."

long time lurker but thought I would ask you guys for an opinion on a question I have.  It actually pertains to my brother, who is not a redditor (trying to get him started).  Anyways, he's been trying to apply for med school (he's at a very good undergraduate school) and just took the mcat.  However, his score was not as high as he would have liked, scoring a 27.  He's now trying to figure out what to do and I guess he feels that maybe its not good enough to apply to schools right now.  Last time I spoke to him, he said he was thinking about taking a year off and applying to internships and then taking the test again that year.  The thing is, he's gotten pretty good, if not really good, grades in the premed classes as well as doing a lot of volunteer, lab work pertaining to the medical field. Reddit, do you think he has a chance to get into a med school with this score and background?  Or should he wait?

The most recent incident: I just moved into a new apartment building and I went to do laundry for the first time here. I ran two loads (putting the second in when the other moved to the dryer) because I was told that you're allowed a maximum of two machines. I moved the second load to the dryer about half an hour after the first one. I assumed the drying process would take about an hour since that's about how long all the previous dryers I've used have been. I lost track of time a bit and went to retrieve my clothes about 20 mins late (i.e. about 1 hour and 20 mins after I put the first load in the dryer), and found that my first load - panties, bras, and all - was strewn across the table. Okay, whatever, someone needed the machine. I push it all into my basket and head back upstairs since I can't grab both loads at once. The elevator arrives and a middle-aged guy steps out. He takes a look at my laundry basket and asks if my clothes were the ones he took out of the machine. I say yes. He asks me angrily if I could take them out myself so other people could use the machines. He claims he took them out of the machine 45 minutes ago. I apologize and say that I didn't realize they would take that long (that is, they would be done that soon - but I can't form words well on the spot). He continues to yell at me about how he's sick of taking other people's clothes out, and other people need to use the machines too, etc., etc. This goes on for a few minutes, I continue apologizing, he continues yelling. I finally get in the elevator and start tearing up. Worse: I have to go back for my second load, tears in my eyes, fumbling about trying to get my clothes out of there as quickly as possible (dropping them on the floor multiple times) as the guy just stands there and watches me silently. Then a lady casually asks me about my laundry basket in the elevator as tears are streaming down my face.

I hate being a crybaby. I hate taking everything so personally. I honestly wish I could just stop caring about everyone and everything. Sometimes people make mean-spirited comments *on the internet* (which I grew up with, so I should just be used to it now) and I start crying. Now I'm thinking of getting a rolling laundry cart and taking my clothes to the nearest laundromat (1.5km away, I don't drive) because I'm terrified of ending up in that situation again. I'm terrified of running into him in the elevator. I've been crying for an hour because one guy was angry at me for 3 minutes. I don't have any close friends I can talk to.

I'm away from home for school right now. ""Join a club! That's the best way to make friends!"" - I can hear you exclaiming it already. On that note, earlier this week I thought I'd join the archery club at school. Turns out there's really high demand and it was very busy. I've never done archery before. At one point in the night, I was preparing to shoot and my instructor walked off for a minute to grab a different bow for someone else. I have terrible posture and he had been adjusting it before all of my shots, I don't want to pick up any bad habits early so I lowered my bow and waited for him to return. This guy was standing behind me waiting to shoot and he told me I was ""swinging my bow around too much"" (I admit I swung it about half an inch right as I lowered it and turned partially to see where my instructor had gone... there were 5 targets and I was shooting on the leftmost one). I shrugged it off and said ""oh, sorry."" Then he went on, ""if you're not going to shoot, can you get off [the lane]?"" I was pissed. My instructor came back and I said ""I was waiting for my instructor to come back so he could check my posture and such."" Then he told my instructor about how I was dangerously bow-swinging. Super pissed. Even now, I'm *still* angry and upset about it, and it was such a small thing. I almost don't want to go back because I don't want to see that guy again.

Several months back, I received a mediocre final evaluation at the end of an internship and I started crying. It seems really inappropriate for a professional environment and I really want to avoid it happening again... I just want to stop feeling. I want to cut out my tear ducts and the part of my brain associated with emotion. Alternatively, I'd like to hear some more realistic approaches to woman the fuck up and stop being such a crybaby about everything."

108ai6,4,2012-09-20,Electrical vs. Biomedical,Saleomar,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/108ai6/electrical_vs_biomedical/,"Hey guys,

This is a x-post from /r/engineering. I'm looking for some guidance from anyone.  I am a senior biomedical engineering (BME) student at an east coast university. I am a years worth of senior design away fro my degree, but I have a problem. I don't feel like I know enough to be a valuable contributor to an engineering project just yet.

The way BME at my university works is that it is part of the ECE department. About 50% of my degree was EE courses. However, I keep hearing how BME majors have trouble finding jobs simply because of the lack of focus in the major (which I agree wholeheartedly with now after 4 years of it).

To make a long story short, I took around 10 graduate level BME classes as my electives (not realizing I wouldn't be able to get a graduate degree from them) because I would be double counting them as undergraduate and graduate level courses. So I came up with a potential solution: switch my undergrad degree to EE.

It would only take 1 extra year (luckily, my mothers life insurance will cover the tuition cost) to finish the degree and I MAY, keyword MAY, be able to have the school transfer my graduate classes towards a masters in BME. In addition it will help me boost my GPA a little bit more and I would get to continue my internship in a lab for another year.

My question for you guys is this: is a degree in EE worth the extra year regardless of whether or not I get the masters degree in BME?"

Him and I have been together, well, it will be 5 years towards the start of this next year. We have gone through most of college together and some of the there after. I love him a lot and have wanted to take 'the next step' the last two-three years with him. However we have had some pretty odd up and downs. We do not live together and only had for a short period in college. And he does not want to move in because he does not have a permanent or at least stable job yet and he wants to be able to pay rent. (not to mention at the start I didn't either cause it seemed silly, we both got along well enough staying with each other and had crappy enough room mates to realize we'd be okay together) I can understand this and this is a great reason, however, I can't help but get sick of waiting. Every year someone who has known each other for a lot less is moving in together or getting married and here we are living nearly a 20 to 30 minute drive apart and waiting for the rest of our lives to happen. I'm starting to blame everything on him and then myself for getting mad. In the last year I've decided that I could deal with not getting married and maybe even just moving in together but he still doesn't have a set job yet (it doesn't matter that I wouldn't mind paying for us both to stay in the same place). I've been realistic and brought up splitting up and maybe taking a break for a while but he doesn't seem keen on that either, he gets very sad and says things along the line of as long as you're happy. About a year and a half ago I  gave him a 2 year deadline in my head to get a job and move forward in some way. He has had some recent interviews that may end up working out, I truly hope so, but I worry our problems go further. So many people jobless or not find a way to be together all the time and many people less fortunate than us have gotten married or moved in together. I guess I worry that he is making excuses and that I'm just holding on for no reason. How long do you keep waiting? Is our relationship already ruined because I'm getting mad at him over issues that wouldn't exist if we were living under the same roof? or are those issues we would have anyways and I'm using that as an excuse? 

Some more background on us :
I haven't always been the model girlfriend either, we are (24 (f), me ), and he is 23 (m). I moved to his home state near his hometown, away from all my close friends and family, for my first job nearly 2 years ago. He has been looking for a job for about 4 months now and worked an internship prior to.

As a lower class minority student, I’ve encountered many facets of the Ivy League that I love and hate. I want to give my opinion of the Ivies / elite schools to explain any prevalent stereotypes that may hold some truth to them.

To preempt any questions about my background:
I am a second-generation Mexican student from SoCal majoring in History. My mother and father have worked at packing house since I was a child but have recently returned to school. I applied to Yale along with several other universities using my experience as an embodiment of the generational / cultural divide between my parents and I while focusing on my struggles with identity. I pay around $500 a semester due to financial aid and my parent’s income. Prior to college, I worked at supermarkets and in the fields. Since then, I’ve explored an interest in law through internships at LA firms.

I’d have to (badly) compare elite universities to reddit. Some moments remind you why you’re proud to be in a community that promotes conversation and growth. Other times, you see a comment that makes you just want to give up and delete your account after realizing how callous people can be. At the end of the day you’re still roped into the opportunities that it provides because there is simply nothing like it. Similarly, I’ve encountered some really amazing people at school along with some pretentious assholes. 

I guess I’ll answer a question of my own to start things off.
Are Ivy League students pretentious douchebags?
No, for the most part I would characterize students as oblivious - oblivious to their privilege, to locals, to the consciousness of their larger social role. If you were to ask a student at any IL about their social class the majority would claim to be middle-class when in reality most are upper-middle. A good amount of students have been in comfortable worlds of private schooling and will never need to concern themselves with worries such as finding a next meal, paying rent on time, etc. At the same time that doesn’t make them bad people. I’ve met some amazing students from a wide variety of backgrounds that do pass up lucrative jobs in favor of teaching or non-profit work, realize the absurdity of the IL, or are simply good people.

Not sure if this is interesting to anyone but let me know if you have any questions.

I have switched majors MANY times. I have worked in the real world more than most and finally came to the conclusion that, unlike most people say, a stable job that pays the bill takes away a lot more stress than being broke and loving what you do. So here I am, actually getting somewhere with accounting. And now I must decide my career path. 

I ultimately want to end up in a high position. I know everybody wants that, please don't ridicule me. I am a hard worker and do what it takes to get where I want. I am a dreamer and will eventually get there and I will enjoy the journey. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy accounting, just not as much as business.

I feel as though a position that would suit me very well as an entry level professional would be some form of business advising. I want to start in a position that will let me help small business owners fix or grow their business. Not forever, but I think it will start me on the path I want to be on. 

Now, for the real question. I chose this major for one major reason and that is job security. There's never going to be a time that accountants are not needed and I want to know that I can get one if needed. So should I do my internship as an auditor and get my CPA or should I go straight for the gold? Thanks everyone for your help!"

10bdls,0,2012-09-22,"Mitt Romney and more.....the down votes begin. (this is NOT spam, but watch it get spam deleted)",[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/10bdls/mitt_romney_and_morethe_down_votes_begin_this_is/,"Subject: MITT ROMNEY
Just some facts about Mitt Romney that we will not hear about from the media.

Mitt Romney:

* After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar, but never worked as an attorney.

* As a venture-capitalist, Romney's first major business deal involved investing in a start-up office supply company with one store in Massachusetts that sold office supplies. That company, called Staples, now has over 2,000 stores and employs over 90,000 people.

* Romney or his company Bain Capital (using what became known as the ""Bain Way"") would go on to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others.

Got your calculators handy? Let's recap.

* Volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign 1 year.
* Unpaid intern in Governor's office 8 years.
* Mormon missionary in Paris 2 years.
* Unpaid bishop and state president for his church 10 years.
* No salary as president of the Olympics 3 years.
* No salary as MA governor 4 years.

That's a grand total of 28 years of unpaid service to his country, his community and his church. Why? Because that's the kind of man Mitt Romney is!

* And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost 15% of his income..
This is real character vs....well you bullshit liberal rhetoric.

Romney may not be the best representative the Republicans could have selected. At least I know  that he won't desecrate the flag by continuing to bow down and apologize to foreign powers, or squander my money on multiple vacations and failed loans. 

I believe he has the ability to turn this financial debacle that the ""Spending President"" has aided Clinton and Bush getting us into. We didn't know that when Obama said he'd give us change, he meant nickels and dimes, and he would get the big bucks publishing books about his life that contained made up material and material composed of multiple events rolled into one. 

We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but someone with Romney's background we have a better chance of doing it. Why did we hire a community organizer to fix our fiscal problems? Would you hire Pen and Teller to run the House and Senate? Would you hire Snoop~~Dogg~~Lion to run the DEA? Would you hire Keith Richards to head up pharmaceuticals? 

Romney never took drugs, did not associate with communists or convicted terrorists, nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for an omniscient being to damn the United States. Granted I'm not crazy about magic underwear but it pales in comparison to a church that damns our country. 

Obama pledged a transparent government and pledge to place the discussion of every bill before he signed it on the White House website for Americans to vote on, he pledged that large bills would be on C-Span where we could see it. he lied. None of those things ever happened.

Obama pledged to shut down Gitmo, He lied. It's still open and fortunately so because the very detainment center and the very methods he campaigned against and swore to end, are the very same used to put an end to Osama Bin Laden. He even promoted general David Patreus to head of the CIA. Yes Obama made the man most of you labeled General Betray Us head of the CIA. Obama pledged to do away with many Bush policies and instead has lied continuing on most of those policies. 

Obama has become the very type of politician most of you bitch about , rail against and voted against to put him into office in the first place.

I am a fiscally conservative and socially liberal independent. I'm voting for Romney. He's paid his dues in taxes and more in charity than Obama(who also pays a tax rate lower than his secretary btw) and if it's the best complaint and argument you people can come up with as to why you want to vote for Obama other than team politics and you aren't able peel yourself away from being a Democrat (or a Republican in the case you refuse to vote for Obama) to vote for somebody else...you're voting for all the wrong reasons. 

I refuse to not vote for a man simply because of his political party of choice. I refuse to not vote for a man simply because he's wealthier than I am.  I refuse to demonize one rich man and defend another simply because of political party affiliation. I refuse to believe all the bullshit on tv, the campaign ads, and the ridiculous polls. I refuse to let left leaning /r/Politics force me to be quiet even if they keep deleting my submissions or claiming it to be ""spam"" (What a fucking joke...""liberals"" that rally against imperialism who imperialistically delete my non liberal leaning submissions) I will not go quietly. I will defend my choice.  Condemn me for it all you want but remember this....

This ain't fucking football and  even if it were....

We're all Americans first.

We're on the same team."

The war was ended by a joint effort and raid inside of the enemy fleet, a suicide run that's still classified to this day.


Several cities are still rebuilding and eighty or more movies are in production of the events, along with countless books by survivors, including this one.

I thought about collecting perspectives of the war, ending with my own. I lost a hand and some feeling in my arm in a battle, so I'm guided along by an iPhone 6 and about three interns on a global interview trek.

We are a Survival/Role-Playing Game server that has recently become ""premium"".

We feature dozens of plugins (listed below) and several venues that may pique your interest. Such venues include The Mall, The Event Plaza, The Gallery, NPC Villages, etc. In addition, we try our very best to host events daily regardless of how many players are online. Some of our events include Unscramble, Trivia, Zombie Apocalypse, Hunger Games, PvP Tournament, Building Contest, Pig Race, End of the Line, and the King of Ladders. We strive to provide the best service possible. Our staff is always ready to assist players on the go. In short, we assure you of our best attention. Our grand desire is for all players to have a memorable experience here at InvisionCraft. With everything said, it is up to you to walk into the door. Are you in?

I'll keep this short and sweet. I'm an American who is technically still a student in Paris until January 2013. I have received a job offer from a relatively small (but growing fast) company in Paris. They'd like to start me out as a stagaire, since a convention du stage is incredibly easy for me to obtain and then, if all works out well, switch me to a CDI towards the end of the year.

I'm here because I'd love to know from any non-Europeans what that process is like. I know that the government isn't exactly dying to give out CDIs to Americans (or anyone non-European) so:

1. are there any tricks? 
2. How long does the process typically take to go from foreign student --&gt; CDI worker?
3. Have any of you done this successfully? 

Finally, does it make most sense to start as an intern as they suggest and then negotiate the CDI thing later (clearly much sooner than later) or try and start with the CDI, which as I understand could forfeit the remainder of my student status if I am not approved by the government.

Man, living abroad can be complicated! Any and all help would be MUCH appreciated!

Merci à tous!

**TL;DR** Got a job offer in Paris. I am still a student. I am American. Process for obtaining a CDI? Help? Dites-moi! Merci!"
10akur,7,2012-09-22,"[21F] in LDR with [21M], different ideas about commitment",hellodaisy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10akur/21f_in_ldr_with_21m_different_ideas_about/,"My boyfriend and I [21M/F] have been dating for a year in a LDR (EU/USA). We met last summer, started dating while I was in Europe, then did long distance for a couple months while I was in the US, before I moved back to Europe to study abroad for 6 months--now I'm back in the US and we're back to being long distance.

It's my senior year of undergraduate and my schedule is slammed. I'm taking above the maximum allowable course units, doing an internship, running a campus organization, and trying to recruit for jobs. I'm gone from 8AM-10PM most days--this, on top of the 9 hour time difference, has made it incredibly difficult for us to Skype, and my boyfriend is not coping well at all.

On average, we talk once a week for 30 minutes to an hour. Throughout the week, I'll send him FB messages and emails, for his birthday I'm planning on getting him a smartphone so we can text via Whatsapp (Right now, texts cost us .50 cents each, so we don't do it very often). Still, he's told me that he doesn't really like messaging and wants to talk more often face-to-face. 

Unlike him, I am completely satisfied with this arrangement. I miss him, but I am very absorbed in my life here and in making the most of my senior year. I feel that while we're apart, its important that we connect with the people around us and not spend all of our time talking to someone who can't physically be there. I love him and treasure the time we have when we Skype, but I honestly feel like what I need to focus on right now is myself and accomplishing all of my academic/personal goals before graduation. He understands, and is trying to be accepting, but this has still put a serious strain on our relationship--I can sense his unhappiness, while makes me feel unhappy as well, and then angry because I feel like he's guilt-tripping me, even though he does his best to hide how he feels (yes, this is irrational). I don't think things can continue the way they are now, but I don't see how they can change either.  I've suggested taking a break or even breaking up, but he wants to stay together (as would I, but I want what's best for him and don't want to sell him short either). Am I being selfish? Should I be more compromising? How can/Should we continue?

tl;dr: I think talking once a week is OK, my boyfriend wants more commitment. I'm busy and not able/willing to change, but he wants to make this work. What should I do?"

I have been attending a film trade school in Europe for 2.5 years now and my internship period is coming up in February. Since my school has a very good reputation for their interns and graduates I can pretty much apply for any (realistic) intern position. 

I have a passion for both equipment, camera's and cinematography, so I thought it might be nice to try to get a position as Camera Assistant. But I also want to spend my time wisely. I don't want to turn my internship into a 8 to 5, i'd rather spend 15 hours a day on set and learn as much as possible and build up a network around me. There is a intern spot left on a CSI type weekly Crime Series (TV), I would be working on the set for the next 6 months but I doubt I be given any camera work but I probably would learn a lot of how stuff goes down in a proffesional heirachy. 


This is a 6 month internship and I would have to choose another place and position to intern at for another 6 months after. Both of these internships are a huge decider(sp?) to what I will  be doing after I graduate, since most people get offered jobs in their last year or freelance for their connections gained through intern periods. Personally i'd love to be working on shorts as a director (i'm currently directing my first 25 min short) or become a DP in the future. So i'd want my internship to prepare me for that in some way. I still have lots and lots to learn !

I reach that point. ",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10adg4/im_not_suicidal_i_need_to_turn_my_life_around/,"I'm 21, go to university, do very well academically, had two summers of internships. 

And I've had chronic leg pain for 3 years. I've been to Stanford, Mayo, every doctor who will see me. And there's nothing. Painkillers help, but I am only content when sitting or lying down. Doctors gave up, so I've given up.

I think I would make a great boyfriend or friend. But, I have trouble both meeting people and connecting with people. Partly because I can't do anything active and partly because I don't trust people. 

Friends that I had before my chronic pain worsened have all ditched me. 

The last girl I kissed (2 years ago) didn't want to date me because I was ""too boring"" on account of not being able to go hiking and other fun things. 

There was one girl that I really connected with and felt that she liked me despite my chronic pain. But, of course, I screwed that up too. Too attached, I suppose. I've been trying to meet a girl that makes me feel the way she did, but I haven't even gotten close. 

I have awful chronic pain with no treatment in sight. I'm alone. I cry myself to sleep wondering when it's going to get better.

I was prescribed antidepressants, and they made me angry. I even got pissed at my only friend. I know she feels uncomfortable around me. 

Do I want to kill myself? No. I have no plans to. But, I just don't get enjoyment from living anymore.

Next quarter, I'll have a packed schedule and I recently got an on-campus job and I am on track to start an unpaid ""internship"" for a few hours a week.

I've never been to a party. I don't enjoy getting drunk or doing drugs. Last year, I hung out with similarly minded people, and although I felt the first two quarters were a blast, the last quarter, I just dreaded college and wanted to go home.

Should I feel ""pumped"" to return to college? Am I a weirdo who doesn't have fun in college? I enjoy learning, it's just that last quarter I dreaded college and felt bored with it, already.

I guess this is more of me sharing my thoughts than a question...but I'd still like for some people to share their experiences or provide some insight. Thank you for reading this far."

I'm 19f, my bf is a 21M, 9 months together, the friend is 30M

 First off, as I wrote each email I had my SO over my shoulder so he's completely informed. Anywho, I sent him an email saying something along the lines of ""I don't think it's necessary for us to share a room together- it seems like you have other intentions. This is just a career chat between friends, right?"" He replied right back with ""My god... I just realized how incredibly sketchy that sounds. I'm just so used to traveling alone I figured having a friend around would be nice. By all means, I'll get you another room, anything at all that you need. Honestly [My Name], you are very attractive and I would sleep with you in a heartbeat had you been single, but you're taken, and I would never want you to feel uncomfortable around me. I would love to talk to you about [my university]. I'm so sorry I made you feel this way. I feel awful..."" Etc. Etc. 

He goes on to say we should chat over Skype first, to see he's not a creep. We talked on Skype, he seems normal as can be. We talked from his office and his secretary even came in to give a wave (he told her about me). During the chat we talked about our past few weeks (BTW, I was in my office dressed conservatively, so don't think i was boob-a-licious in a tank top in bed chatting). During the chat I told him I still felt a little uncomfortable about the whole thing, and he asked if a lunch would be better, and insisted I bring my SO so he could meet him too. But if I still wasn't comfortable with him, he insisted that at the very least he could write me a recommendation for any job or internship, and call if anybody gives me a hard time.

I feel in my gut that this guy is real, but I know what I've seen on the news and I know no matter how genuine he is online he could still rape me of kill me given the chance. I'm going to Skype him a few more times and discuss business school and the like. He seems to have good intentions (even though he did mention he'd like to sleep with me...) but I'm keeping this purely through the internet until I have the time to meet for a lunch in with no hotel room, and I'm bringing my SO. If he at anytime gets creepy or makes me uneasy, I'll cut contact, but for now he seems to want to be a nice guy to a poor college couple. I have no idea why he's taken me under his wing, but we've become friends, and somehow this feels ok. I know you're going to say I'm an idiot, I'm naive, and I'm a stupid girl, but I'm going to ride this out with my SO over my shoulder every step of the way. Thank you all for your concerns.

**TL ; DR: Keeping contact with friend to gain more trust, keeping SO in the loop every step of the way.**"

I was also a network administrator at my college for two semesters.

I love learning languages (both human and computer languages, though I have much better luck with computer languages) so hopefully I should not have major problems adjusting to different languages. 

I do not have any criminal convictions. Perfectly clean record.

I am willing to consider alternative destinations as well. I'm not too choosy about the location, though I would prefer moving permanently (or for a long time, at least). I'm an Indian citizen living in India.

I would strongly prefer having a job first, however, as opposed to getting there and then looking for a job. I've tried applying for a few jobs online, but didn't receive any replies.

Could anyone please share any advice or suggestions on what I could do? Thank you!"

* Zero work experience

* Associates degree in Electronics Engineering Technology

* GPA: 3.5 

* http://efedotov.carbonmade.com (stuff I made outside of school)

* I also made http://www.gladiator-studios.com/ (didn't create the art and products)

* I am a competitive, no bullshit person. Wherever my interests lie, I strive to go above and beyond.

* I want a job that deals with assembly, electronics, technology, etc. 

* I will relocate to anywhere.

* I can't drive.

I have gone to a job fair, open house, Craigslist, Linkedin, tried to apply in-person, and personally contacted hiring managers. I have received replies. I know my resume is out there, because I have been contacted twice for a position (unfortunately not related to my skills). Yet, it looks hopeless. I haven't been interviewed once (other than that open house). My college had no internships for me. I need experience. I feel so hopeless knowing there's so much I can learn, but without any solid backing, I feel overwhelmed. I'd be happy with $10/hour as long as the job fell under my interests. I am lost; where should I be looking?"

Tuesday is the Engineering Career Fair - http://www.engineering.iastate.edu/ecs/career-fair/

Wednesday is the Business / Liberal Arts / Human Resources Career Fair - http://www.business.iastate.edu/careers/career_fair

A lot of good companies will be present - among them my employer, Boeing.  We'll be looking for Engineers and IT folks for full time hires (graduating seniors), and internships (all other years) for next year.

The IT new hires would be part of this program: http://boeing.com/careers/collegecareers/rotational_programs.html#iscfp

Normally candidates are required to go through a lengthy online process for the ITCFP (IT Career Foundation Program), but for people that we meet during the career fair, we will be doing onsite interviews (later in the week).  We're also looking for a few (very few) new hires in information security (data loss prevention / incident response / cyber threat mitigation).  The IS jobs will not be interviewed for onsite, but we are collecting resumes for them, and will reach back out to qualified candidates.

I'm not on the engineering side of things, but I believe they are doing onsite interviews also.

Even if you don't want to work for Boeing - stop by and check the fairs out.  There are some very good companies attending: http://www.eng.iastate.edu/springfair/companysearch.asp?major=all

I'll be there Tuesday - feel free to stop by and ask questions (re: Boeing).  (I'm at the airport right now, but I will also check this thread later tonight also for posts.)"

Had a couple of interviews that ultimately went nowhere, and it's starting to get discouraging.

It's pretty competitive out there, and I'm worried about having to find a non-career/retail job to keep me floating for a while. I don't think there's anything wrong a job like that, but I'm worried about losing momentum in the pursuit of a career-based job, and somehow making myself less hire-able in the eyes of interviewers when they see that I've gone ""off-track.""

Try again?,JakobMiroslav,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/10citf/20m_dumped_after_6_months_by_20f_try_again/,"So I had been dating my girlfriend for 6 months up until about a month ago when she broke up with me not quite out of the blue. I reckon it's easiest to start from (before) the beginning and then work chronologically so:

We'd been vaguely friends since starting university about 2 years ago though were both in relationships. I broke up with my ex-girlfriend in December last year and found out she had broken up with her ex (of getting on towards 3 years) in early 2012 as well.

Over Easter we hung out a lot and finally got together in April. Everything was great for the next 3 months whilst at university and we could see each other very often, however, obviously we lost contact a bit over the summer.

We live fairly close to each other but still around 2 hours apart so whilst it didn't seem like one I guess it turned into a bit of a LDR. Coupled with the fact that she worked every weekday and I had internships for much of the start of the summer outside the country, we didn't see a lot of each other.

We then spent a week together in early August which I had thought went well and we were still very much in love. Unfortunately after this she went back to working and so I only saw her a few times over the next few weeks. Admittedly, towards the end of our relationship there were two instances where we met up and I was feeling pretty down (I suffer from depression [which I hadn't brought up with her as it never seemed the right time] and I think I was also missing her a lot as well).  

Skip forward to September and whilst out with her and some of my friends she pulled me aside and said she wanted to stop seeing me. I saw her a few days later and basically her reasons were that she didn't think she was fully over her ex and that things hadn't been working since leaving university.

She was pretty insistent that there was nothing that could be done to work things out, but I really feel as though a lot of her problems with the relationship were due to never having one before where it wasn't possible to see the partner frequently for an extended period of time.

I still feel very much as though the relationship can work and will see her again later this week when we return to university and want to see  if I can convince her but really wanted to just hear what people had to say. My friends I've talked to about it have been cautiously supportive of this plan but I can't help but feel its just because they can't be sure either way and so find it easier to agree with me.

I realise that people are probably going to tell me there's no hope and if they do, so be it I guess.

Finally, sorry for the disjointed writing, I'll clear up any questions in comments and sorry if this is more suited to /r/relationshipadvice or something.

I'm a freshly graduated computer engineer working on my first resume and cover letter. It's the first time I write a resume, so I'd like to get some feedback.  [Resume](http://pabloreyes.es/resume.pdf)  
I'm not a native english speaker, so there might be some typos. Please let me know if you spot them!

I have also written a cover letter for a recruitment agency:

&gt;Dear Mr. X:
&gt;
&gt;If you have any client seeking a junior developer for any IT position, I would like to make a strong case for myself. 
&gt;
&gt;Although I'm a freshly graduated, I've been developing for years and learning things every day. Maybe it's not because of my professional experience that someone would hire me, but I'm very active and passionate about technology, I have initiative and I'm sure my potential will rapidly be noticed. On my internship at Y, I gained the confidence of my co-workers and manager in less than two months, when I was offered a job position. I'm also certified as a Java 6 Professional Programmer by Oracle with a score of 92%. 
&gt;
&gt;But it's not only technology what attracts me. I'm also interested in business and company culture: how relations works between people, how colaboration and implication benefits the whole group and in general how things can improve the work environment and the company itself. 
&gt;
&gt;Other thing I think I have on my side is my location. I live at less than 1 minute walking from Z. This would help making the relocation unnecessary, making my availability inmediate.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for considering my application. Please, accept my attached resume as an application for any position I could fit in. I look forward to discuss this further.

Does Reddit have any financial advice for 21 y/o me?,godfuckdamnit,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10c1cd/i_have_been_living_without_power_in_my_apartment/,"I have made this throw-away in an attempt to keep this information away from friends/family...I can understand how this rambling may sound to a 3rd party spectator, and I'm just not the kind of person to dump my emotions on a friend. I'm a much better listener. As are many of you. So, Reddit... Give me your best shot. Be brutally honest.

I am sitting in my car, with my laptop plugged in, and I am parked at a local McDonalds stealing the wifi. I am charging my phone, and my step dad has paid my cell phone bill for this month, and filled my car with gas. I plan on selling my phone, possibly my car, and all of my furniture... but would it even be worth it? I am currently working at a doctors office as a paid intern. I work 20 hours a week, 2-6pm Monday through Friday. My father makes $9,000 a year, 1/3 of which automatically goes to my mother for back child support. My mother makes an easy 6 figures, but refuses to help me. I have been looking for a second job, and applying for financial aid in school since January, when I got this job by freak accident. I do not qualify for a bank loan without a co-sign. I do not qualify for financial aid for school because I am under the age of 24, and my mother's income is too high. I have even faked being a student at the local community college in an attempt to speak with a guidance counselor - seeing if there is a way to opt out of being ""dependent"" on my mother's income. I have not turned down any jobs. I have been in and out of restaurant jobs, but I fail. Every. Damn. Time. My guests say that I am awkward and forgetful. I have been torn apart emotionally, and have been stuck in this rut for 9 months. My grandmother owns a business 4 hours away from where I live, and I go work for her as often as I can, but by doing so I spend the majority of my existing work check on travel. The rest goes to food, paying off past family loans, and gas for my car, (or bus fare.)

I have been living without power since Wednesday... And if I don't have $1200 by October 1st, I am homeless.

I live in a city where I know nobody. Only my father, (Who's wife thinks I am not ""family"" enough to receive her help,) and my boss - who has done as much as he can to keep me afloat this long. There are 6 people in my office, and I work only 8 blocks away from my apartment. I almost always have a ride to work. for that, I am overwhelmingly grateful.

I don't want handouts. I'm not asking for money. Maybe some encouragement? Maybe some solid (legal) suggestions as to how I can make $1200 in a week? Have you ever been so deep in trouble that you thought the streak of awfulness would never end?


Hell, this ramble may not even make sense to you... I'm desperate, and scatterbrained. It's just hard to hold all of the pieces together."

My family still wants me to focus solely on business so I have to make a plan for my future to persuade them that I'm not just goofing around. Here are some of my questions that I hope you guys can answer.  I'd love some career advice too!

- I understand that to be in the actuarial profession, I need to take a series of exam. From my research, those from SOA are the ones I need. Lets start with the preliminaries, is there any particular order as to which exam I must/should take first.  

- I have heard finishing all the exams is the equivalent of getting phd, is that true? Are the prelims the equivalent of a master then? If yes, do I still need to go to grad school for actuary?

- Back to the prelims, what are some courses in college that are kind of the prerequisites for those exams? Since I started late in the math major, I only have 3 cal classes and intro to stats. I plan to take more next semester so I would love some input. Just curious, when did you guys take your first exam?

- How's the employment prospect in this career? My advisor told me it's of high demand. I'd love some truth people!

- I live in Charlotte NC. Is there any internship opportunity? I have done some research but havent found any. I could intern as a business major but I really want the experience in actuary since I have none.

They threw rocks at me and I threw them back when my dad came outside with a shotgun and almost shot them, but they were able to get away. I was so embarrassed I began masturbating furiously with my stuffed dinosaur doll when my mom came in and told me it was time for dinner! I told her I was fapping but then she yelled at me and told me I couldn't spend my whole life sticking my penis inside a tiny dinosaur, then I told her I would become a dinosaur fetish porn star. She got really mad and told me I would be a failure like her uncle, but I didn't care. I left the house and went to my weed-smoking friends house, I got so high I flew into the moon and met the cheese elves who live there. They told me that the only way I could stop the Minotaur (the guy with the body of a bull and head of a man) was if I got an apple and shoved it up Katy Perry's ass. I accepted the quest, but later realized Katy Perry was actually a 50-year-old hobo version of me, come from the year 2180 to tell me that if I couldn't slap Pikachu I couldn't ride her mom. After spending years debating whether chickens could swim in gelatin I hooked up my gameboy color (it was the purplish-invisible colored one) to my friend's lava lamb, but it got really upset and started baahing at me like crazy, so I whipped out my chocolate- flavored kunai knife and stabbed it 37 times in the chest. My friend was all like ""bitch be trippin' balls"" and kicked me out of the house, where I then realized if you had 3 quarters,  4 dimes and 4 pennies you'd have $1.19. I got in to my white van looking to pick up some chicks at the park, but when I finally got over there I remembered that I was an octopus, and the third arm on my right was actually my penis, and was detatchable sort of like the way a midget with a beard looks kind of like Squidward if they were taller, had orange skin, didn't have a mustache but had a bigger nose.  Then I finally found the master sword (the one from the Legend of Zelda games) and asked Telephone if they needed to go to the bakery yet. He said no, but I could see in her eyes that it really wanted to be my unpaid intern. I ended up hiring them and now we're married with one kid named charlie, named after the kid I sit next to in science. He also sits next to me in science, but that doesn't matter considering I'm already a level 55 Dark Paladin with the Spear of the Dragonfucker on my side, I'll always be able to make sure kids get to school on time. Except for yesterday, when Gordon decided he would touch Alice's arm and she screamed ""RAPE!"" causing me to swerve the whole hot dog and I crashed into Pikachu. Remembering my side-quest I slapped that motherfucker, then was teleported to Led Zeppelin-land, where my bass started vibrating so hard the waffle cone told me to gtfo and then I asked for the power to fly, so everything exploded into Cinnamon Toast Crunch. That one annoying lady on the magic school bus gobbled everything up and said ""Science!"" before falling facefirst into two lesbians making out. I then picked up my backpack and walked back to mars, realizing that I may finally get to sleep in my own bed. My walk turned in to a run, then a sprint, before I ended up in a swarm of Zubat. I waited for the 3 minute title sequence to end, then whipped out my Mage Staff and zapped there asses, but I underestimated my abilities and blew up Planet Earth. Silent tears began pouring down my face, and I gobbled down my KFC. The a few hours later I went through my regular morning routine, brush my teeth, go poop, get in the car, shower, go to school, get home from school, teleport to Uranus, fap furiously, visit Bill Nye, beat Chrono Trigger again, catch all 756 pokemon then realize that it's already the year 2180, and I'm not Katy Perry, which means Bill Nye was lying. I went back to Uranus trekked through all 17 pounds of it's crazy-hot lava and slapped that Gengar, He used Mean Look and I shit my pants. And by shit my pants I mean turn into nyan cat and fly through the sky farting rainbows all over the fucking sushi-filled egg roll. The only real answer was, ""did he kill my father?""

We fired the laser but destroyed the universe and that's why I'm annoyed, I never beat the Water Temple in Pokemon Gold."

A couple of months ago, my now ex girlfriend [21] and I [also 21] split up from basically being fed up with each other. I had relocated for the summer for an internship, and our relationship was rocky in the first place.

She spent the majority of her summer with some co workers of hers, one of which she kissed 2 days after our almost 2 and a half year relationship ended, and started dating him the next day. Before we ended it, I was a wreck because I knew exactly what was happening, but being 6 hours away from her, I couldn't do anything about it.

She had moved into my house before I left, and still lives here now, although spends all of her time at her new boyfriends. Things between us were awful until I came back, and once we actually started talking in person, things got better. And better. And better. To the point of us fooling around behind her boyfriends back, which has now been put to rest by her.

The real problem was that I was really taking everything as mixed signals. The night/days we were together were the most passionate we'd ever had, but, then she would just kiss me goodbye and go to her boyfriend. I've been trying to get her back, but to no avail. I don't make her happy like I used to, and her new guy does. She wanted to be ""bad"" with me, but not ""good"" with me. She claims to care about me and wants me to be happy, but, the only thing I want is her, and she knows that and has done what she can to convince me otherwise. I know, in the long run, we'd never work. We want too many different things, and we have such different likes, dislikes, and opinions as it is, but, I can't help but still love her. I never stopped, and I don't know how to now.

I apologize for the massive wall of story, but, I have to get it all out. I have to get her out. She messed with my head, and now, wants seemingly nothing to do with me, mostly because I'm so upset about everything. I'm really at a loss for what to do, and I really do feel like I need a drill just to get her off my mind. 

So, strangers of reddit, please, help me. Help me move on. I need it more than anything.

[I'm trying to do this as politely as possible. Sorry if I offend anyone for asking a question, even if it may of been asked several times]

My problem lies within choosing a college/University and choosing the right degree. I.E. Some schools have different names, different curriculum, different requirements etc.

**What's the difference between Aviation Flight Science and Aerospace Flight Technology and Operations? There are many different names out there. Please clarify if they are all the same or different.** 

Here's the rundown:

Out of state student, On-Campus (PA no longer has any colleges/Universities with Aviation Flight Science according to the book in the guidance office at my school)
____________________________________________________________________
I've read the [sidebar info thread for civilian pilots](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/pic9w/want_to_be_a_pilot_in_the_united_states_a_helpful/).

I've done a /r/Aviation search regarding degrees/colleges and came up with the following posts that were meaningful:

[DAE Have a Bachelors degree in Professional Aeronautics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/gdug1/dae_have_a_bachelors_degree_in_professional/)
Some notable comments include people being successful with maintenance, helicopters, and foreign jobs. Others include not so successful people that have graduated from Embry-Riddle.

[Help with colleges](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/wkzwq/help_with_colleges/) - Get a non-aviation degree so you have something to back yourself up on.

* Auburn University good program; in the 30k range without flight fees.

* Middle Tennesee State University has a good program; in the 30k range without 
flight fees.

* Southern Illonois University in Carbondale has a good program; 30k range without flight fees.

* Central Washington University has a relatively good program, but still in the 30k range without flight fees.

* Washington State University has a good, but small program that's closing in on 40k w/o flight fees.

* Kansas State has a good flight program that's has a nice flight; in 30k range w/o flight fees.

* University of North Dakota - Good program, but you have to live in North Dakota for 4 years; about 30k w/o flight fees

*Brevard College of Miama - Simply suggestion; about 35k w/o flight fees

[Has anyone here gone through a college and used Financial aid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/h6v4j/has_anyone_here_gone_through_a_college_and_used/)

* Apply for scholarships, older university tend to have more internships / financial aid opportunities .

* Purdue has a good program, lots of out-of-state, 40k range w/o flight fees.

[Any aviation college or colleges with aviation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/oysah/any_aviation_college_or_colleges_with_aviation/)

* Basic list of colleges, no real backing, all are 30k range w/o flight fees.

* Florida Tech - Personal bias says this is a fairly good college, user recommends it because of flying weather. 50k range according to collegeboard

[Who can tell me more about college aviation] (http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/t5tqy/who_can_tell_me_more_about_college_aviation/)

&gt;Make flying and education completely separate endeavors. Get a degree that will be useful when not flying. Get a business degree. Better yet, do something technical that has broad job prospects and is highly portable. You are definitely going to need it.

* This entire post and it's comment basically said **do not** get an aviation degree as they worthless.

___________________________________________________________________

* **What kind of job do you want?**

Although, I do not want a job in the airline industry. My current goals are either OTS or ROTC is the college I pick offers it.  I believe I have a good chance of being selected for UPT with the work I've put in during high school (activites, volunteer hours, scholarships, clubs, fitness). If I do not get selected for UPT I will apply to ANG / AF Reserve units across the country.

* **Why military?**

Obligatory ""I come from a military family"" statement. I enjoy the structured life mainly. You have one job and you do it. You get fed, housed, and some nice benefits. Also, military aircraft are pretty badass. (Some civilian aircraft are badass as well).

I've done what others have told me: talk to pilots, military personnel, congressmen, senators, ex-Pilots. I've gained a great bit of information and I've decided it's right for me. **I am not going to let someone else's experiences ruin my own**
____________________________________________________________________

**Closing Statement**

I don't care if you read it, if you have any advice, experiences, gripes, or complaints just throw them out there.

I plan on keeping this updated and provide much more detail for each University with links, financial aid calculators, flight fees, and eventually a list of scholarships.

10exko,9,2012-09-24,A brief synopsis of my life,[deleted],happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/10exko/a_brief_synopsis_of_my_life/,"I worked very hard all throughout high school to get into the college of my dreams. I got into that college, met the woman of my dreams, and for a while, I thought I had it made. 

And then they raised tuition, and denied me financial aid. 

I was forced to return to my home state to attend a university that I do not want to be at. I'm 2,000 miles away from the love of my life, I  feel dead inside as I walk around the campus of this new university. I work the weekends and rarely see any of my friends. I do not get breaks, I do not get sleep, I've had to stop my hobbies, and I am not where I worked to be. 

But you know what? That's okay. I have the love of the most amazing woman I will ever meet, and the 2,000 miles don't make a damn bit of difference. I may be at a university that I don't belong at, but it's temporary, and I'm working to make it my own with internships and helping with research. I work a dead-end, undignified job, but shit, why view it as that when every dollar I save gets me closer to a plane ticket to visit my girlfriend? 

I am healthy, and fit. I live with three inspirational roommates, and on a daily basis we have shenanigans and conversations that people make sitcoms about. 

Every day I tell myself that a smile towards another person can make all the difference. I may not feel it at times, but I am incredible, undeniably lucky. And I see no reason not to turn my luck outwards and improve the lives of others in any and every way. 

At times, I yearn for the past and feel as though my efficacy as a younger person was much higher than it is now. I was always the friend that people called at 3:00am for support and help, when no one else could help them. I was the guy who was there when everything went to hell.

Now? I don't even see my friends, let alone help them. 

But fuck that, I can create my own opportunities, and my efficacy is not dictated by my situation being forced upon me. 

Some days, I look back on my life, and all that I've done, all that I've suffered. I grew up rough, and am lucky to be alive, and luckier still to be sane. Some days, I look at where I am and think that it's not fair that I'm here, that I deserve better. 

On those days, I stop and remind myself, ""No. This is where you need to be. Make the most of it.""

Sometimes, I feel as though I have every reason to be unhappy. But the truth is, I have more reasons than I can count to consider myself blessed.

We are going to spend the whole week together for this internship. Am i seeing things, or is it completely random?

Update: After a very pleasant walk with her in our break, we were waiting by the door to get back in. She told me about how she and a friend of hers had so much fun in the weekend, both hooking up with a guy each, and how nice it was to make out with him all night.

I saw that you guys were [somewhere interested](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/yy8jj/r_subredditofday_finding_new_mods_submitters/) in the daily working of /r/SubredditOfTheDay and my recent announcement of hiring new writers from the community.

I wanted to give you guys the heads up directly myself. From the horses mouth as they say.... but first an origin story.

/r/SubredditOfTheDay was run by /u/SROTD himself. But due to being too awesome he had to resign. I have taken control... yodda yodda yodda, new leadership, new direction circlejerk. Anyway, I knew my writing skills were never up to par but I always wanted to contribute. So the next best thing I could do is hire those that could write.

Here is a list of gang... hopefully in cronological order of *hiring*. 

* /u/SROTD (Retired, now only a guest writer)
* /u/syncretic (Retired)
* /u/SidtheMagicLobster (MIA)
* /u/LGBTerffic 
* /u/UkuleleNoGood (Retired)
* /u/BauerUK (Retired)
* Few more that I do not know the name of...

* /u/JMaboard (Retired, now only a guest writer)
* ---
* /u/hippiemachine
* /u/Soupyhands
* /u/SaltyChristian
* /u/Freakazette

Everyone below JMaboard was a recent intern. Hippie, Soupy &amp; Salty and Freakazette are the first batch of new full time writers. I'm so damn proud of them. They are fantastic. I just hope the rest of the interns shine as bright as they do.

##Intern Progression

Hopefully all these interns will flesh out to proper full time writers. My end goal, which I haven't mentioned to anyone yet... but they'll figure it out eventually is... to have enough writers that they are always fully prepared. And to become a guest writer myself.

_____
So I grew up in a very Christian household. When I was a kid, I was forbidden to play Pokemon cards, or read Harry Potter books, simply because the church deemed them ""Satanic."" So while my friends were off having fun with those, I got to do nothing but sit in a corner on the playground by myself. I was so forced into the church and convinced it was all true so strongly, that it even had an impact on the way I dressed. Ex: awkward-fitting jean shorts, ugly Nike shoes, shirts with cheesy religious stuff that wasn't even the correct size, and a huge ugly cross pendant. I met my best friend through this, but let's keep him in the background. The entire time, I had always suspected I had homosexual tendencies, but I would mentally punish myself each time I would even start to think about just considering that. I would call myself stupid, and evil, and pray for forgiveness because that's what I was raised to believe. However in about my junior year of high school, my best friend came out to his parents as gay. Every day he would get told he's going to Hell. No, ""Hi,son, how was school?"" Instead, he would get ""You know you're on the road to Hell, don't you?"" I'm there for my friend of course, and this is where my mind starts to doubt religion. Just so slightly. It really started snowballing in my biology class, thanks to our student teacher who was a blood dialysis intern at the local hospital. One day, during our discussion of evolution, someone brought up homosexuality and how it happens. The class immediately starts arguing with each other and she quiets the room. ""Class, the existence of homosexuality is not evil. It's not unnatural. There are several theories as to why it could, like such as a species' population control. However, there is one theory that a lot of us at the lab strongly support. During a woman's pregnancy, she releases the testosterone to her unborn baby to help the sexual development. But sometimes, they don't release the usual amount. When a mother puts off lower amounts of it to the baby, it's seen to influence a preference for males. When it's higher, a preference for females."" This changed my whole outlook. After that, I start going to church less, and less, and less, until I didn't even go on my own will at all, but was still forced to go occasionally. Pretty soon, I start seeing a guy (who was a total regret, but that's not important here) and soon I realize why none of my girlfriends were ever attractive to me. I also started questioning my belief in God as a whole. I went from agnostic, to agnostic-atheist, to where I am now as a total Atheist. I am now also a contributor to r/trees, thanks to my friend introducing me to the best antidepressant on the face of this earth, and he helped me come out.

10egw6,219,2012-09-24,My coming out.,natarobot,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/10egw6/my_coming_out/,"So I grew up in a very Christian household. When I was a kid, I was forbidden to play Pokemon cards, or read Harry Potter books, simply because the church deemed them ""Satanic."" So while my friends were off having fun with those, I got to do nothing but sit in a corner on the playground by myself. I was so forced into the church and convinced it was all true so strongly, that it even had an impact on the way I dressed. Ex: awkward-fitting jean shorts, ugly Nike shoes, shirts with cheesy religious stuff that wasn't even the correct size, and a huge ugly cross pendant. I met my best friend through this, but let's keep him in the background. The entire time, I had always suspected I had homosexual tendencies, but I would mentally punish myself each time I would even start to think about just considering that. I would call myself stupid, and evil, and pray for forgiveness because that's what I was raised to believe. However in about my junior year of high school, my best friend came out to his parents as gay. Every day he would get told he's going to Hell. No, ""Hi,son, how was school?"" Instead, he would get ""You know you're on the road to Hell, don't you?"" I'm there for my friend of course, and this is where my mind starts to doubt religion. Just so slightly. It really started snowballing in my biology class, thanks to our student teacher who was a blood dialysis intern at the local hospital. One day, during our discussion of evolution, someone brought up homosexuality and how it happens. The class immediately starts arguing with each other and she quiets the room. ""Class, the existence of homosexuality is not evil. It's not unnatural. There are several theories as to why it could, like such as a species' population control. However, there is one theory that a lot of us at the lab strongly support. During a woman's pregnancy, she releases the testosterone to her unborn baby to help the sexual development. But sometimes, they don't release the usual amount. When a mother puts off lower amounts of it to the baby, it's seen to influence a preference for males. When it's higher, a preference for females."" This changed my whole outlook. After that, I start going to church less, and less, and less, until I didn't even go on my own will at all, but was still forced to go occasionally. Pretty soon, I start seeing a guy (who was a total regret, but that's not important here) and soon I realize why none of my girlfriends were ever attractive to me. I also started questioning my belief in God as a whole. I went from agnostic, to agnostic-atheist, to where I am now as a total Atheist. I am now also a contributor to r/trees, thanks to my friend introducing me to the best antidepressant on the face of this earth, and he helped me come out. He's also a fellow redditor here on r/atheism, so I hope he sees this and knows I appreciate him. Now I actually dress like I have a style (which is pretty damn cool, btw) and even have my ears gauged out at 10g, which I never would have done 2 years ago, and I now live a renewed life free of fear, doubt, and self-hatred. I have never been so happy in my entire life. Oh, and that friend I was talking about who came out before me? Yeah, he hates me now, and still goes to his church three times a week.

Would it be a bad idea to email the people I have interviewed with but have yet to hear back from on second interview and inform them that I've accepted the internship? This will obviously make me look more qualified but I don't want to piss them off by sending an unnecessary email.

10e5og,1,2012-09-24,I want to leave my current career path and follow my dreams. Am I an idiot?,BrockThrowaway,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/10e5og/i_want_to_leave_my_current_career_path_and_follow/,"Some details... I'm a 20-year old Software Engineering student currently at a 16-month internship with a software engineering company. The internship would end at the end of next summer and I'm looking to return to school and finish my degree after that, with only one year to go.  It would be completely pointless for me not to finish my degree, as I've already done 3 years of it. I'm just not positive what I want to do after that.

Partially relevant details: I've recently come to terms with the fact that I'm gay, and started coming out to many of my family and friends. Back when I was in the closet, I hid a lot of my personality, dreams, and aspirations because I had deemed them too ""gay"", and I didn't want to have that stigma attached to me. I cut all of that out of my life and turned to engineering, which seemed like a viable option. In retrospect, I wish I had simply embraced who I was.

My true goal or passion in life is hard for me to pinpoint. Originally, I always wanted to be an actor in film and television. I loved the local productions that I was involved with when I was younger, but quit them in high school when I was trying to hide who I truly was. But I'm also very, very interested in the behind-the-scenes aspects of filmmaking and television shows, such as screenwriting and directing.

Lastly, my other true passion in life is music. I played piano from a young age and consider myself to be fairly talented. I love playing the guitar as well. This, though, I may consider to be more of a hobby than something I could make a career out of. If there was a career here, I wouldn't want it to be music education. I would want to be in a band or as a solo artist, touring and making new music. The style of music I make would definitely be in the ""indie/indie rock"" field.

My goals and aspirations seem so... unrealistic, compared to graduating with a software engineering, getting a stable job, and not worrying about income. But I know I won't be truly happy. I've considered several options, all which start with me finishing my degree. Then they branch out: Should I get more education focusing on tv and film production? Should I get a software job in L.A. (seems like San Francisco would definitely have some options) and see what I can do from there? However, a full-time job would probably be a huge obstacle in trying to break in to the entertainment industry. 

I'm also worried about the diminishing returns on my engineering degree. If nothing works out, I've assured myself ""at least I have a software degree I can fall back on."" But if I'm not working in that field after graduating (and the longer I wait), I feel that my chances of getting a job would be considerably slimmer, especially in the rapidly changing world of software and technology.

Is this crazy? Am I an idiot for thinking of abandoning a solid, well paying career, when so many people are desperate for one? Also, my dreams are a bit different from each other. If I do intend to do this, I have no idea which one to focus on. If I was successful with music, would I still have that itch to get into tv and film? How viable is this, anyways? Moving to California, without having a job, would definitely be expensive. Not to mention the fact that I'm actually Canadian. Should I move to Toronto instead? Or Vancouver?

I would just say that I'm very, very confused and lost about what to do with my life at this point. I feel like after coming out, I've kind of turned a new leaf, and I want to be this different person I had always wished I was.

**TL;DR:** After I get my software engineering degree, I want to completely switch paths and head into the entertainment industry (acting, writing, directing, or making music). It's always on my mind, and I feel like I would regret it if I don't. I feel like I won't be happy with a software job for the rest of my life, wondering what could have been. Am I an idiot?"
10e47y,2,2012-09-24,20120924 - 659.  Uggos.,FredTrellis,MoreThan600,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoreThan600/comments/10e47y/20120924_659_uggos/,"Has it not struck you, as it has me, that every villain in every movie, theatre piece and musical stage adaption of the Manga classic - is ugly?  Even in radio plays and audiobooks - the voice of the villain is always creepy, evoking an ugly person.  
  
Moreover, when we make the regrettably necessary journey back to our real reality, we can see mugshots of detained subjects:  those unlucky enough to fall under the spell of meth, those unlucky enough to have circumstances where theft and it’s associated risks are preferable to starvation or invisibility, those pedophiles unluckily denied entry to the priesthood.  
  
These mugshots are not, for sure,  captured by  a top glamour photographer.  No-ones' diary reads “10am : Maxim at muscle beach : Lucy Liu lingeries shoot.  12:30 : Prostitutes and their needles (mugshot and evidence), Highgate Constabulary”.  What a giant of the illuminated black and white grainy world you would need to be to stand astride such a chasm in your day planner.  How many interns would you need to prevent mixups?  The restraints on Lucy Liu should be decorously  pink and fluffy hints of the dark fun that lurks in the souls of men, and those on the crack whore are necessitated by the darkness that has tired of lurking in the souls of men.  And one intern is insufficient prophylaxis where, potentially, Lucy Liu ends up wearing the wrong handcuffs.  Indeed, one intern would be insufficient prophylaxis Lucy Liu ends up wearing the right pink and fluffy handcuffs..  A photographer would need these details checked over and again.  
  
If s/he existed, such a photonic giant would be hard-pressed to make much of a mugshot, no matter how skilfully they deployed their outside-in white umbrellas.  They are simply not given the basic material to work with.   In short, like the fictional villains of the imaginations deliverables, the real villains are predominantly ugly.  
  
For sure, this represents prejudice.  Discrimination against those less beautiful.  Preference to the symmetrical, the fashionable thin but not skinny, with strawberried hair and blueberried eyes.  Through the medium of the internet, we have heard first-hand testimony of beautiful people who sailed through life, borne on the breeze of approval from all around them.  The invitations to the prom.  The constant reaffirmation of people ingratiating themselves in tiny ways.  The speeding ticket that is waved away.  The better seat in the cinema.  Opening a new carton of chocolate ice-cream - even though 32 flavours is nearly the same as the advertised 33, and that we actually closed 5 minutes ago, sure it’s no problem, I’ll just open a new one, scoop out a couple of balls of obsequiousness, and handle your cone with loving care.  Do you want a marshmallow with that?  
  
  
It is not so for the less aesthetically pleasing.  These people have realised that in the gene-replication contest that life is, they lost already.  The moment they were conceived.  With no chance for a bye into the quarter finals.  Through no fault of their own, their ugly face predicts an ugly future.  
  
The stress at being so comprehensively a loser in life is crushing.  Daily grinding it’s fear of rejection and loneliness into deeper asymmetries and cracks in an already-distressing visage.  No one can truly paint a brightening, cheery and welcoming smile on to a habitually scowling, frowning bitter ugly face.  
  
  
So it is, that those who genes have dis-favoured are stressed by merely existing.  They already feel a self-rejection in anticipation of a wider rejection.  They already feel the bitter pain of lost love - love for themselves.  
  
The beauties of this world glide, self-assured, self-loved and approved through this world.  The uglies struggle daily against their stress, pain, angst and rejection.  This is the real reason for the mugshots and the theatrical villains being ugly: these are the people who are likely to snap first, and reject and threaten a society that rejects and threatens them for their unchosen appearance.  
  
One day you will may see climbing a tall tower with an AK47 slung across my shoulders.  Now, you know why.  "

The head of dept said that she was told about my girlfriend's boyfriend (me) and that I was close to graduating with a chemistry degree and the position was opening and asked to have me send her a resume. I sent her the resume and ended up not hearing anything back so I sent her an email inquiring about the position. She thanked me for the reminder and we set up a phone interview soon after.

Here's where it gets kind of *different*, I guess. At the end of the interview she mentioned that she would be going on vacation starting the next day, for two weeks, and would not be making any decisions until she got back. Also, there would be another interview, if I was selected from the group for another interview, and one of the group leaders within the department would be participating in it. I found out from my girlfriend that the second head of dept was also going on vacation. Head of dept (A) returned last week and I have no heard anything back yet and word from my girlfriend is that Head of dept (B) just returned today.

My question is, how do I approach Head of dept (A) and not seem desperate or annoying. Its been a whole week since she's been back but I have not heard anything yet but she has shown appreciative of follow-up emails. Most of our contact has been through email but the phone interview seemed to go really well. She even said that I make a good candidate because I have a lot of time available for the position. Do I email her again or should I wait it out? What should I say in this email? I don't want to come off as too desperate but I REALLY dont want them to forget about me. Any advice would be really helpful!

Eventually after 7 months of her threatening ti inflict self harm i stopped carring all together, i even told her that she should just do it and stop talking about it. The terrible part? I dont regret saying it. I have devalued the life of the one person i loved and couldnt care less. I feel like shit that i have placed just such a low value on human life in general, reduced to mearly a fucking machine to be fixed and a game to solve when something goes wrong.

ever since then, i've harbored a grudge against david blaine. fuck that guy.

edit: up until now, the only people who knew this story was my wife and the help desk kid. who, to this day, thinks i'm certifiable. my wife does, too but that's a different story.

When I talked to a big four recruiter he told me to apply for internships and jobs because they may not accept me as an intern because I will be graduating. I feel as if I have been put in a catch 22 situation. I can't get in without the internship but cant get the internship. I have a 3.56 gpa at a school that is heavily recruited from by the big four. I am in many clubs, play a serious club sport, and am a teaching assistant for intro to accounting (it is a pretty hard position to obtain). Just wondering if you guys have any advice for my interviews or in general to get into the big four? Also heres a list of companies I have applied to so far KPMG, PwC, E &amp; Y, Delloitte, Grant Thornton, and Mcgladry. Thanks so much fellow number crunchers."

All I want is some guidance or help.,fwp_guy_need_advice,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10dlb0/i_feel_like_a_zombie_all_i_want_is_some_guidance/,"For the past four years I've almost felt like zombie with tunnel vision who's oblivious to everything around him. I have no motivation and desire to do anything, there might be times where I'd like to do something, eat something, etc., but I don't think I've felt true passion or even hormonal in such a long time. I remember being a freshman in high school and feeling impulsive or able to set my mind to something. I often times feel panicked and if I don't manually breathe then I'll pass out. I'll be having a conversation with anyone and I'll just randomly zone out and I have no fucking idea what is going on. I feel like anytime I'm with someone new I turn hyper-sensitive to a degree, like I can't relax and it becomes awkward because I'm avoiding eye contact and can't think of anything constructive to say so the conversation dies leaving complete silence. This also correlates to any sort of physical or mental performance where I'm so concerned about all these things I become a nine year old kid or something who's incapable of higher intellectual/physical capacity. An example of this would be a math tutor looking over my shoulder asking me to work out the problem; I just immediately freeze up and can't even do operations like multiplication or addition.

I just turned 21 and I'm a junior at a community college who got kicked out of a state college for poor grades. I feel so far behind because I switched majors at the start of my sophomore year from computer modeling to software engineering. So instead of taking core classes like most sane people do for the first two years, I took the accelerated path under my degree plan. When I switched majors, it made these classes essentially worthless, I guess they count as advanced electives however. Basically, I'm a freshman again that's categorized as a sophomore. I'm overweight, 5'9"", 200 pounds, with no job experience whatsoever. I also have no portfolio/github, because I can't get motivated or essentially jump into something. I feel like my moral or social constructs are set the wrong way. I feel like I value my friends more than my family when I shouldn't.

At my lowest points sometimes I feel like completely running away or even offing myself. I stop every time though, every time I think of all the disappointment and sadness that I would cause to my family and friends. The idea of starting fresh or going back for a reconstruction of my life sounds like paradise.

This is all fucking retarded though, because I shouldn't be bitching, there are people whose lives are much more complicated and have far more obstacles. I'm sitting here bitching even though I have a very small semi-supportive family and a few good friends. What's even funnier is that I also somehow have a girlfriend who's incredible in so many ways, finds me as a bad influence on her, yet still stays with me and tutors me through everything. I don't fucking understand why I don't really have feelings for her either, I just feel 'meh' about everything and it pisses me off! And yet, 'pisses me off' when compared to other people getting upset is incredibly mild from an outside perspective I would assume. 

**TL;DR** {
I'm just tired of so many things, so tired... I guess all I want is advice on how to be passionate/motivated, how to feel clear, how to find love for my girlfriend/friends/family, and how to get into software engineering market (internships, experience, etc.)/be successful, essentially just how to live. Sorry for the long post... I just had to do something.
}

I've thought about this a bit, and a few things that I thought might help a little bit at a time would be;
* getting in shape * seeing a psychiatrist * talking to more people instead of sheltering it all in"

1. Should I lie about having a college degree?

2. What type of education should I put? High School? AA? (I transferred to my four year school from a community college)

3. I know this is a separate question but as far as background check goes: Does anyone know if it only checks for Criminal background? Or will it show that I graduated from a four year university?...

The centre sees approximately 60,000 patients per annum or 150 per day. We have a fast stream area, trauma/resuscitation bays, a 24hr stay area and general cubicles. Currently we follow the standard triage protocols, pts are redirected to an appropriate area, treated, then discharged or await admission.

Our ER is undergoing a drastic change in an attempt to combat ever-increasing numbers of daily presentations. The new model: 

* Replaces the triage nurse with a single nurse who sees the patient for a few minutes and redirects them to the appropriate area - trauma/resus, fast stream or assessment cubicle. 

* Each pt is seen within 10 minutes by a nurse and Attending-led team - either an intern, resident, fellow; all pts run by the Attending (Trauma/Resus care does not change, seen immediately). 

* All interventions and assessments are ordered within 30 minutes, and the patient is transferred to a general cubicle or short stay unit and a new team of doctors/RNs. 

* Once it has been determined whether the patient needs admission or discharge, they are either discharged within 4 hrs (where practical) or accepted by the most relevant specialty. Interim orders are written by ER staff. Assuming there are beds, they are sent directly to the appropriate ward prior to seeing the specialty team. They are admitted on the ward.

This radical change has been met with both excitement and skepticism on the part of RNs and physicians. Has anyone worked in this kind of environment before? Any thoughts on this?"

So long story short, I have tons of experience programming all sorts of things and a lot of motivation and passion for creating programs, **but** I suck at the typical interview questions about efficiency and generating a nice algorithm on the spot.


How to interviewers view this? I spoke with some people from several companies including Hulu and Yelp, and they all seemed interested in me and liked my experience.

She left in May and came back at the end of August. 

She grew up in a religious family and when she left home I was her first. Things went really well for about 6 months and then she began said she no long wanted to have sex which I was fine with. And we struggled with stopping for just over a year and we finally managed to stop. We also had other troubles with non communication but the sex was the main issue. 

While she was away at her internship we broke up because she said that she was no longer in love with me, and that she had not been happy for a long time. She began seeing a guy while she was there and she said that she felt like she was in a relationship with him for the last two weeks she was there. 

Since then we have spoken a lot about us and she says that she still loves me but can't get over our past discrepancies. She has been dating but says she isn't serious about any of them but just wants to get her mind off of me. 

I'm also dating around. (not serious either) and she gets upset if I mention anything about it. That coupled with the fact she says she still loves me but is no longer in love with me, leads me to believe that she wants us to work. She's even mentioned that. 

Now here's the question: I'm not sure if I should stick around or just move on. I've honestly felt like she was the one for a long time and I think we will get back together but I'm worried that it maybe pointless/doomed to fail.

I think a little background would be helpful.  I grew up in a rural area with a gravel driveway and no where anywhere near by to skate.  Growing up I always wanted to but just do to my area it wasn't really possible.  

Fast forward to the present and after a few years in college I decided to finally give skating a try (large cement covered campus is MUCH easier to skate than a gravel driveway).  I bought a board back in March and started just skating around campus.  None of my friends skate so I didn't really have anyone to offer suggestions, teach me, etc.  

This summer I got an internship out in Connecticut and found a great skatepark near New London and started going there.  The first couple times were REALLY nerve racking as even with just a few people there I was by FAR the worst skater and often it would be me (21) and a bunch of younger teenagers and they would all be ridiculously good.  I started just going later at night trying to catch times when no one would be around.  

Long story short I still absolutely suck at skating (can't devote too much time due to a full time job), I still haven't learned to Ollie, and I feel awkward when I try and go practice because I'm not just some terrible little kid whose obviously learning, I'm older than most of the people there and clearly the worst.  

Did anyone else learn to skate when they were older (out of high school)?  Learn to skate without other skaters?  





TLDR: I started skating late in life, none of my friends do, I suck and feel embarassed in front of younger skaters.  Advice please."
10gk0v,4,2012-09-25,About to graduate college and very worried about the future,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/10gk0v/about_to_graduate_college_and_very_worried_about/,"hey everyone, 

I'm currently in my last year in college and will (hopefully) graduate next May.

I am going for a degree in Information Technology with a minor in English. Originally, when I came to college I planned on majoring in English since I was obsessed with literature in high school. However I soon got burned out on that major (it was not for me) and decided to just take a minor. From there I figured I would switch to Communication, but hated it and stayed in that major for like one semester. 

The summer after that semester I found out that my school had a major for IT. I didn't know what IT was at the time but I spent a lot of time online and I knew there were a bunch of jobs in IT, so I figured that would be the major for me.

So now I'm finishing up that IT degree and I'm very worried about the future. Honestly, I am not that great with tech stuff; I'm fairly competent but really as much as any kind of geeky kid who spends a lot of time online. I see a lot of my classmates and they have had all these internships and they spend their free time using all kinds of software and modding PC games and fixing computers for everyone and I have done none of that. 

So I feel like I am in the wrong major, basically, and I don't know what to do. The major I am in is also not a very technical major; it's a lot of ""technology theory"" and stuff, with only a few classes that teach software or programming. So I'd say the vast majority of the IT classes I've had have all been stuff like ""social applications of technology.""  I don't see how this will help with a job.

So basically it's this: I am in an IT major and I am not super enthusiastic about it; I'm not a super tech guy and I don't know what options I have in terms of careers anymore. I am sick of college but dreading graduating because I don't know what I'm qualified for anymore. My major has not taught me any real technical skills and I just feel really despondent and helpless.

Any suggestions? I am speaking with a dean soon"

[Are you for or against legalizing marijuana?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6csbbm?context=5)|I Am personally for the Legalization of Marijuana. I personally think it needs to be legalized, taxed and regulated like alcohol or tobacco is.
[If I was the President and I wanted to insert one of your cigars into an intern, is there a particular type or technique you'd recommend? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cseno?context=5)|Honestly I would give you the cheapest cigar in my humidor it costs about $1.50, cause the level of wetness would make it smoke like hell. As for technique, I'll let you figure that out for yourself.
[I love cigars, but I'm not certain I know how to truly enjoy them. I say this because I can't often tell the difference between a $2 cigar and a $20 cigar. Is there a technique akin to wine drinking? Or should I remain ignorant and enjoy the savings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6csjo1?context=5)|Have you started to note how the quality of the burn is? Also start to look at the oils in the wrapper, the pre-draw, another thing to consider is, see which one you can pick up complex notes from. Start with these if you still don't taste a difference, then keep smoking the $2 cigars!
[Do you ever feel guilty whenever you hear about people suffering from lung cancer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6csxvi?context=5)|No, they made their choice to smoke, I feel bad for them, but I don't feel guilty, anymore then if I heard someone got drunk and died of alcohol poisoning, it wasn't my fault they smoked themselves to death. I am sure that sounds cold.
[No, it sounds rational.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cxewy?context=5)|Glad to hear.
[Would lifting the embargo on Cuba affect your business? or is American tobacco considered to be just as good as the Central American product?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6csvv4?context=5)|As to your question, I will answer it in two parts, the first part, if you lift the embargo with Cuba, all you will do is start to see a mix of cuban cigar leaf and central America cigar leaf, combined. Cuba as a country can't produce enough cigars to meet current demands, that isn't going to change anytime soon, they only have so much room to grow tobacco. Also, America doesn't produce much tobacco anymore, they only produce some outer wrapper leaf.
[Thanks, very interesting. And what's your 'favourite' cigar, or which one would you consider an all-round best (regardless of the price\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cts4z?context=5)|If you put a gun to my head and told me I had to smoke one cigar for the rest of my life, I would say the Padron 1964 series, Corona Maduro. It has a lot of flavor it fits in a size that I like. I also enjoy the rich chocolate notes and hints of coffee, with a smooth finish. If you haven't tried one do yourself a favor and try it! the cost is about $11.
[Do you smoke a pipe? If so, what is/are your favorite blend(s\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6csl24?context=5)|Yes I do smoke a pipe, My favorite blend would very, depending on my mood. I make a personal blend that I enjoy a lot, but I also enjoy the Frog Morton line from McClelland. As well as, most G.L. Pease blends, particularly the Old London series. Happy smoking!
[Thank you for taking time to do this AMA! I'll be sure to consider giving these blends a try. I'm almost out at the moment, so this was particularly well-timed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cuh1p?context=5)|You are very welcome, I am trying to put a better image on who and what the cigar and pipe smoking community is. Also make people realize that I am not some sort of evil big tobacco company trying to sell people cancer sticks.
[Is your family full of heavy smokers?  Anyone get lung cancer?  When you tell people your line of work, are you ever ashamed/do you ever have to address the negative stigma surrounding tobacco products?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6csaxe?context=5)|Most of family isn't ironically enough, most of my uncles, all part of the cigar side, smoke cigars occasionally, but most don't smoke.  There is no lung cancer in my family, my aunt might, but she has been a chronic cigarette smoker for years, and doesn't as of right now. I have learned to make a joke out of the stigma, I introduce myself as a cancer merchant and a death dealer. But for the most part, people seem to think I will hand them cigars left and right. I answer question as best as I can when asked. I am proud of my heritage in the tobacco business.
[I have had people telling me my whole life not to smoke. So far this is advice I have followed.  But whilst I have the chance to ask a pro I may as well ask the question, why should I smoke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cto2o?context=5)|I find that smoking is a way for me to relax, when smoking a cigar, I can feel my stress start to melt away, I love the way the smoke tickles my nose and taste on my tongue. I love the community that cigar smokers create when they are together.  I would say, try a cigar and if you don't feel relaxed and you don't enjoy the flavor;then give it up, cause either you like it or you don't. I haven't found a middle ground yet.
[Would your family consider switching to or adding marijuana to your crop if it became legal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cw9k2?context=5)|We don't actually grow tobacco, just sell it. 
[Care to give me a short list of your favorite cigars? In addition to that, can you recomend at least one that may not be very well known but in your opinion is a must try?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6csfmn?context=5)|My top 5 is really hard, I would say right now, they are; The La Aroma De Cuba Edition Especial, The Padron 1964 maduro, The Mercialago from EO cigars, Diamond Crown Maduro, Tatuaje Spooky box Dracula. And for something that is hard to find, but super good, go with either the 262 paradigm or the 4 kicks from Crowned Heads.
[Its hard to beat Pepin, do you like the special edition more than Mi Amore? Also an Undercrown can be hard to beat for the price! I am becoming a first time father anyday and have an my father le bijou 1922 on hand for the occasion.  I was thinking about picking up a box of cigars that would age well to have one on every birthday of the child then share one when he is 18. What would you recommend that would age well and not break the bank?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cyy7z?context=5)|I like the EE, better then the Mi Amore, when they first came out I smoked 1 EE a day for 31 straight days. I would say if you wanted to get something nice, to smoke that will continue to hold up well as aged, but also not be super expensive, the Padron 3000 maduro, as it ages it will take on the falvors of the 1964 and the 1926. As it ages the flavor will open up and give you some smoothness and some sweetness. Time does both of these things to any good cigar.
[Don't forget about Ashton VSG or that Macanudo maduro with the metal ring. Aurora's Preferidos (forgot how to spell it\) in the Ruby tube is good too, but it seems a niche, just like Diamond Crown.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6ctb0p?context=5)|I can agree with those, they just don't fall with in my personal top 5. But don't get me wrong I smoke a lot of cigars, and seems like every day, I find something to add to the best of the best list!
[What do you think of Drew Estates Liga Privada?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cu72j?context=5)|I think it is a very well made cigar, with a lot of flavor, my pallet tends to fall towards the t-52 more then the number 9. I also really enjoy the Undercrown from them. If you haven't tried that give it a shot.
[How does the business treat you? I figure that it should be very profitable. And also, were you forced to stay in the business or did you do so willingly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6ctu47?context=5)|It is a good business, but it has its own share of problems. I sell a luxury item, in a soft economy, I am also at the mercy of the internet companies, who have almost no over head and don't need to make as much margin. So they can under cut us and we take the hit. The second part, I have wanted to be in this business, I never felt pressured, in fact I chose to quit another job to go work in the family business. I love cigars, I love the community and the people, if I didn't work in a cigar shop, I would work for a cigar company as either a sales rep, or in their marketing department.
[What do you do primarily in the business? Like, what are your responsibilities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cvwbj?context=5)|My responsabilites vary, I do inventories, I order cigars, help customers, it just depends on what I need to get done that day.
[I currently work for a tobacconist (one that's been around since 1981\), and we are always having trouble competing with the prices of online seller (Cigars International and etc\). Has this been trouble for your shop as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6ctfz6?context=5)|Yes, it is, what I try and help people realize is that, if they get a bad box of cigars from CI (cigars International), that it can take them almost 3 weeks to get the cigars, cause it is almost a week coming, a week going back after you found they are dry or what not, and then another week till they ship replacements.  I also show that by ordering online, yeah your getting a cigar at a better price, but if you keep doing that, who is going to help you with your humidor? Or who is going to help make a recommendation? If we teach people, we can win some, but most will be stuck in online way.
[This is the same reason it's important to support your local homebrew shop.  Sure, you can get better prices on line, but who's going to sample your nasty infected beer and tell you what went wrong?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6d7hqa?context=5)|Exactly! I am also looking into starting to brew more of my own beer.
[When your grandfather first opened the shop, did they ever hand-roll the cigars?  And what happens to be your highest selling item?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cs4p4?context=5)|Yes they did have hand made cigars, are you ask what my highest selling item is in today's market? Or back then?
[How about both?  What was your grandfather's highest selling item then and what is your current highest selling item?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6csb38?context=5)|Back then, I am not sure, after double checking with him, he sold more pipes and tobacco more so then cigars, cigars just weren't as big of a deal yet. As for now, our best selling cigar brand, has to be Padron, followed closely by Romeo and Juliet Reserva Real.
[What's your company's lobbying position with respect to Marijuana legalization? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6csd7d?context=5)|It doesn't really effect our business, we are a traditional tobacco shop. The legalization of Marijuana doesn't help, nor hurt our business. I personally am for it, but my father is against it. Again no direct cause on our business techniques.
[With regards to cigarettes, any ideas on why they cant just leave the tobacco untreated with dangerous chemicals and thus render them safer, like pipe tobacco or cigars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cw3cr?context=5)|It isn't the leaves themselves, it is the chemicals they put in the filters, and the paper. Also again even with a great cigarette, chemical free organic, you are still in hailing the smoke. Which you don't do with a pipe or cigar.
[What are the best cigarettes you can buy?  I only smoke when I go camping with a certain group of friends, which is maybe a couple of times a year, and when I do I'd like to smoke the good stuff.  Is there a fancy pants brand of smokes that are flavorful and more enjoyable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cw9s0?context=5)|I enjoy a natural cigarette on occassion, I would say try the Nat Sherman, MCD brown box.
[A delicious cigarette indeed. Well chosen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cx553?context=5)|It used to be one of my favorites.
[I never got in to nat shermans.  They always tasted off to me.  Do you carry Sobranie Black Russians?  I haven't seen those since high school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6d7ivc?context=5)|No sadly, I don't. I wish we did, but they haven't been seen in the US in a long time, but from what I heard they were a great cigarette.
[How has your family weathered all of the changes in public perception regarding tobacco over the last few decades? Things have really changed since 1974, so has your marketing changed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6ctioj?context=5)|Yes we have been able to with stand the storm of public out cry. It seems funny, back in the early 90's there was the cigar boom, were everybody was clamoring to get a good cigar, we were able to grow and make a name for ourselves then. Then in the mid part of 2008 the State of AZ were our shops are, passed a state wide smoking ban.  So we adapted by offering bigger more comfortable places to smoke, we have stuck to our roots, selling great cigars, at the possible price we can offer. Does that make sense?
[I occasionally enjoy a big fat, $20 Cohiba, but by far, my favorite cigar is a Backwoods 'Mild n Natural.'  Is there something wrong with me?  Am I broken?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cub7u?context=5)|Nope, not at all! My favorite saying with in the cigar business to any and all people is there is a cigar out there for everyone, what you like and what I like maybe extremely different, but in the end, we are all still smoking a cigar!
[How much do you smoke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cs66l?context=5)|I smoke on average about 2 cigars a day, I try to keep it under 5 cigars a day, after that many smokes, my pallet is just gone, everything starts to taste the same.
[Good christ. Has your tongue crawled away to die yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6ctxip?context=5)|I was smoking 4 cigars a day for over 3 years. My tongue keeps going and going! Just ask my ex girlfriend.
[Isn't that extremely bad for your health?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cx6zp?context=5)|Actually no! I have had a few head MRI's in my life as well as regular dental x-rays, I am in perfect health.
[What about your lungs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cxv9y?context=5)|Still work well. I have good capacity.
[Do you see a lot of novice smokers go for ACIDs? Do they really market them as differen, flavored smokes? Do you think using flavored smokes (of any quality\) to get people into cigars is right or wrong? Does that last question even matter since you'll make money either way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cvo4l?context=5)|I do see some novice smokes smoking Acid cigars, but mostly I tend to turn them on to mild cigars like Romeos or Diamond Crowns, or Perdomos. I can say from experience there is no other cigar on the market like Acid. They are a hundred percent unique, as to weather it is right or wrong, I personally feel that as long as you are smoking cigars not cigarettes, I am okay with you. I like to help people find something different, but I see that as a way of bring a cigarette smoker into the cigar world. I can't complain about the fact that I will sell them something either way.
[Are ACIDs not a good cigar? i like to have a small one here or there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6czc4o?context=5)|They are a well made cigar, I just personally can't stand the oils and the flavor of them. The person who came up with them is brilliant, cause there is nothing like that cigar. I get people who come in and ask if I can recommend something like an Acid and I tell them, Acid cigars. As I said before, there is a cigar out there for everyone. All you have to do is find it.
[What do you think about the health risks of smoking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6d20fy?context=5)|They are there, but for me, the risks from over eating, over drinking, maybe getting in a car crash. Well I doesn't mean I don't eat food, or drink alcohol, or drive my car. I do what I do cause I love it. I don't overly worry about the risks, I do what I can to keep my likely hood of getting cancer down, but I won't put my life on hold for the health risks.
[Is roll your own tobacco like 4 Aces healthier than Marlboro Camel Kool Newport etc?  I heard it has less chemicals in it but wasn't sure if it was true or not.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cx508?context=5)|Kind of, are you using a natural paper? Or an organic paper? If so then yes, if not, then some what healthier, not a whole lot, your still inhaling the smoke. I am not a medical professional at all btw.
[Some prefiltered papers.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cxh3v?context=5)|They have the same chemicals, in the paper and filters.
[Are you a heavy smoker? Do anti smoking ads offend you? Do you roll your own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6d5zj1?context=5)|Not really, I don't smoke cigarettes anymore, and I am a fairly regular cigar smoker. Sometime they do, especially if they are using a limited range study, to fit their theory. There have been studies done on both sides for and against smoking. Not all research is used, which does bother me. I bet you all didn't know that the biggest supporter of smoking bans, across the country, is...The Pharmaceutical companies, who make Nicorette gum, and stop smoking patches.
[Of course! Its why marinol exists instead of medical marijuana in some areas. But again, smoking anything isn't great. What made you quit cigarettes? And what do you think about swisher sweets and black and milds, cigars like that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6dbofc?context=5)|Let me start with the Cigarettes, I hated smoking them, it was compulsion, not enjoyment, I hated the craving and the need to smoke more, so I switched to small cigars which made it much harsher to inhale. So I cut myself off and now exclusively smoke cigar and pipe. I don't count swisher sweets and black and milds as cigars. They both use homogenized cigar paper, as apposed to actual cigar leaf. The difference between the paper and actual leaf is that the paper, is made from pressed bits of tobacco, pressed into paper, such as particle board is to actual sheets of wood. Does that make sense? Also black and Milds are filled with pipe tobacco, not cigar leaf. So i don't count them, I think people like them and that's great, but they aren't really cigars.
[Well, TIL then. And good job on quitting! What got you smoking in the first place? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6ddqk7?context=5)|Cigarettes or Cigars?
[My bad, cigarettes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6dfun3?context=5)|Peer pressure mostly.
[What do you think of Electronic Cigarettes and their rise in popularity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cw5za?context=5)|It is a fad, like so many other things, I won't be surprised if they disappear in the near future.
[Does your shop sell them?  If not, do you think it cuts into your business, or is there not a lot of overlap with traditional tobacco products?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cxkde?context=5)|I do carry them because we get requests, but it is a minimal part of our business.
[Difference between cigarettes and cigars in terms of contents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cu2yj?context=5)|Cigarettes use a completely different type of tobacco then cigars use mostly cuban seed grown in other countries, were as, cigarettes use tobaccos from other countries. Most cigarettes use a Virginia leaf tobacco, which is cut and treated differently then, what goes into a cigar.
[What is healthier; cigarettes, cigars, or a pipe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cufgx?context=5)|Cigars and Pipes far and above cigarettes. This is because a cigar or pipe shouldn't be inhaled, just puffed on, yes you can still be at risks for cancers of the tongue or mouth, but it is very slim also, part of what makes cigarettes so much worse, is the chemicals that they treat them with, as well as the fact that you bring those chemicals and the smoke into your lunges. You don't with a pipe or a cigar, unless by accident.
[Do some brands of cigarettes have less toxins than others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cy6zr?context=5)|Yes, most of the Natural cigarettes, like American Spirits, have much less chemicals, they aren't a fool proof, but they are a natural, very less chemically treated option.
[I once met Nick Perdomo.  I liked his brand before meeting him and even more after.  Have you met any owners/high-ups that have made a lasting impression on you?  Any interesting stories about meeting them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cvloj?context=5)|I have had many a chance to sit down with many big wigs in the cigar industry. I think my favorite story is one in which I was hanging out at the Big Smoke in Las Vegas. I was there wondering around saying hi to people like George Padron, The Newman brothers, from J.C. Newman cigar company. Well we walk over towards the Rocky Patel booth, and the line for the booth is half way down the hall.  So the person I was showing around, goes, wow that is crazy, we should go get in line.  I said hell no, I am not waiting, so I walk over towards the side of the booth and I run into Nish Patel, Rocky's brother. He sees me and says hi, we talk for a few, then he asks if I want to see Rocky, I said, sure, but I am not going to wait in line. He said screw that and invited me behind the booth, so I walk over and chat with Rocky, while people are still filling past. We play catch up and talk, then I said well your busy, I should get out of here. So we are walking away talking, when two guys come up to us and go excuse me, I said yes, they asked who we were after stating that they waited over an hour in line. I said, I know people and walked away laughing, while they look confused, and trying to figure out who I am. So that is my funniest story. I guess.

[I inherited a pipe from my great grandfather not to long ago, ive done my best to clean it and care for it. I am new to pipe smoking and i was wondering if i should be able to hear the air travelling through the pipe when i draw on it? Also how firmly should i pack the pipe and how do i know the tobacco is done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6d0t5w?context=5)|Wow that is a few different questions, so first question, I recommend pipe cleaners and vodka, to clean the bowl and stem. Next question no you shouldn't be able to hear the air, that is packed to loosely, and that goes into the next question which is how to pack a pipe. Start by filling the pipe all the way up, then pack it gently, and fill it up again and pack it a little bit harder, do this a third time and pack it harder still, so the bottom part should be loose and the top should be tight. That way as you tamp it down, it doesn't get to firm. Last questions, it should be just ash left int he bowl, no really tobacco leaf to speak of, also shouldn't really have any taste or light up when you try to light it.
[Do you care to give specifics?

Would love to have you up in one of the shops!
[I realize you are probably done answering questions, but do you see the e-cigarette market effecting your business in the near future, since it is generally healthier and there are all sorts of flavors available? or, if they do become more mainstream, do you plan on adding them to your inventory?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6d0t1n?context=5)|I am not gone yet! But yes, we carry them, no they won't be affecting my business, or I should say, hurting my business. People don't want a plastic thing to smoke, with cigar like flavor, they wants cigars. Same thing with pipe tobacco, since both of those things carry very little risk of cancer, but cigarettes, people still like the flavor and feel or cigarettes, also the nicotine isn't the only thing people are addicted to in the cigarettes, it is also the chemicals, they use to treat the paper and put in the filters.

I love Hondoran cigars, I would say start with the Perdomo cigar brand, they are a integrated cigar company, which means every step of the process is in house. Also look at Rocky Patel cigars, and La Aroma De Cuba brand of cigars made by Peppin for Ashton cigars.
[Why can't cigarettes taste/smell as awesome as tobacco pipes?  I've never been able to transition off of cigarettes over to cigars or pipes but every time I get a smell of that sweet sweet pipe smell I want to try it again (only to be disappointed\).  Tl;dr I want a cigarette with pipe tobacco in it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6d26df?context=5)|Part of it is the different kinds of casings, also called dressings, that they use to flavor the pipe tobacco, the other big factor is that it isn't the same type of tobacco. Cigarettes tend to be very much made out of Virginia tobacco, where as most pipe tobacco is Cavendish type of tobacco, and again, treated with a flavoring.
[My friend and I enjoy pipe tobacco. What's your favorite kind? He's partial to those vanilla-y types.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6d3hrk?context=5)|I would say if he likes a vanilla sort of flavor, I would say try stanwell's vanilla or try in bulk, Lanes RLP-6, or Stokebeyes Vanilla. I personally stick to the English, or Bulkan style pipes, something with a rich Latakia blend and some nice Oriental tobacco as well. McClelland 2045, is a very nice bulk English style blend.
[How extensive are your hookah offerings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ek49/iama_third_generation_tobacconist_my_family_has/c6cz5n7?context=5)|Limited, we don't get a lot of calls about hookahs and or shesha.

So I personally don't smoke them, but I will say popular opinion is that the cigars, just aren't cutting it. They work in a pinch, but most people order direct from Indonesia.

10gj9k,8,2012-09-25,"[PI] 45. (Your life is only half over, and all of your wildest dreams have come true. Now what?)",bloodrosey,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/10gj9k/pi_45_your_life_is_only_half_over_and_all_of_your/,".45. I was forty-five when I realized it: I had accomplished everything I had planned and dreamed of. You could say my dreams were small, I guess. I wanted healthy children - emotionally and physically. I wanted a stable job. I wanted enough money to retire. And I wanted a beautiful house.

At forty-five, I had already seen my kids finish college and start on good careers. I was expecting to be a grandma in another five years. I had a little yellow house with white fences and a gorgeous flower garden. I had worked in the same job for the same company for the last ten years and could see myself there for another ten. I had retirement funds set up that looked like they would last through retirement.

So, what happens at forty-five when you’ve made it? When you are no longer struggling to create a life for yourself and your family? You get bored, that’s what. You get so bored. And I was so bored.

My life was now governed by routines. Every night with the husband was the same. Every Saturday was gardening and cooking. Every Sunday my children would call me. There was nothing new or exciting. My husband never brought me flowers just because. He never surprised me with new plans for the evening - never said, “Hey, let’s go out for pizza and beer like we’re college students.” There was nothing.

It shouldn’t have come as a surprise that a young intern at my work caught my eye. Perhaps the surprise was that the young intern was a young woman. She was the same age as my son. She could have been his girlfriend.

It started the day she brought me flowers.

“Is it boss’s day?” I asked, worried that I forgot to get my boss something.

“No,” said Sheila. “I just thought that you could use some color on your desk.” She looked a bit shy. “I didn’t overstep, did I?”

“No, no, of course not,” I said, dumbfounded. “They’re beautiful, and, uh..it’s really nice of you.”

Sheila stood by my desk for a few moments of awkward silence before saying, “I’m glad you like them. I...uh, I’ll just get back to work now.”

As she started to walk away, I said, “Hey, Sheila?”

She turned around and I said, “Do you have plans for lunch today?”

“No,” she said, “not yet.”

“Join me?” I asked.

“Sure,” she said. I could swear I saw a blush across her face before she turned again to leave.

I sat back and stared at the flowers. Pink roses, pink carnations, a few ferns and some baby’s breath in a pretty glass vase. I considered taking a picture so I could remember the day I got flowers “just because.”

Lunch with Sheila was full of ‘getting to know you’ questions and conversations. There was laughing and giggling at stories and intense stares as we both tried to memorize what we were told. I couldn’t believe how wonderful Sheila was. She was extremely talented, smart, and just downright nice. As lunch dragged on longer than it should have, I suggested that we get after-work drinks to continue the conversation.

I had expected my husband to be miffed when I called to tell him I would be home late. Instead, he sounded almost happy. I told him I’d make him dinner when I got home but he said, “Don’t worry about it - there are some leftovers in the fridge. Go have some fun, make a new friend.”

Sheila and I wound up at a happy hour. We had half-priced cheese sticks and nachos while guzzling drinks - her cosmos, me manhattans. The happy hour crowd started to filter out of the place after a few hours. Gone were the guys in the suits and in came the girls in the short skirts, dragging boyfriends with backwards baseball caps with them.

“This place has a great DJ at night,” Sheila said, as the music started up. The music had a good beat that was very danceable.

“Hey, do you want to dance?” I asked, with a bit of a slur in my voice. Well, it’s not like I was going to be driving anywhere anytime soon.

It took Sheila a second to respond and I immediately felt like an idiot. But thankfully, she said yes - and again, I thought I saw that blush.

It was so nice to be dancing. My husband had never been into dancing. I hadn’t pushed the issue since I didn’t much care for how loud music was played at dancing venues anyhow.  That night, though, the volume was a good thing. I didn’t have to talk, only look at Sheila. The drinks had lowered our inhibitions enough that our eyes openly showed how we were feeling.

Sheila step towards me on the dance floor, and I step toward her. She wrapped her arms around my neck and I wrapped mine around her waist.  We intertwined our legs and danced in grinding motions against each others hips. Looking over Sheila’s shoulder, I noticed a group of men pointing at us with smiles on their faces. When they saw me looking, they made crude motions at me. I sighed, close enough to Sheila for her to feel my breath on her neck.

Sheila looked me in the eyes and moved one of her hands to my face. She kissed me. Right there on the dance floor, we kissed. I put my forehead against hers and closed my eyes. This was the first person I had kissed that wasn’t my husband in the last twenty-five years. And she was the first girl I’d ever kissed.

I pulled away after a bit of guilt and reflection ran through my head.

“I’m...I’m sorry,” Sheila stammered loud enough for me to hear over the music.

“I think I need to call a cab,” I said. “Do you need a cab home, too?”

She nodded and then followed me as I left the dance floor. We shared a cab and headed to her place first. She kept apologizing during the cab ride while my gut wrenched over that stupid kiss.

“It’s okay,” I said finally. “I...I wanted it, too.”

“You’re very beautiful,” she said.

I didn’t shy away from her touch when she ran a finger down my arm.  The sensation sent a tingle through my arm that continued across my chest. I breathed very deeply, trying to steel myself against the excitement. I turned to her and put a hand on her neck, under her hair. I loved the feel of her long, soft curls over my knuckles. I moved in to kiss her again but stopped just short of it and placed my forehead against hers again.

“God,” I said. “What am I doing?”

“We’re almost at my house,” she whispered, her warm breath reaching my lips. “Why don’t you come in? We can...if you want, we can just talk about...”

I knew if I went in with her, my life would change. My marriage would be ruined. My retirement funds split. My children would, well, I didn’t think they would forgive me. But this was so exciting. She was so young and energetic. She was excited about life in a way I was when I was her age. I wanted to drink in that old feeling. I wanted her to remind me what it was like to not know what was coming next.

When I paid the driver and stepped out of the cab, I thought about Sheila and my life. Would I regret forever that I hadn’t gone inside with her? My husband was asleep on the couch with an open beer on the floor, a dirty dish on the coffee table, and the TV still on. All of the lights were on and his clothes were littered on the floor. I sighed and wondered what Sheila’s living room looked like."

Instead of just posting news articles, we've become the source for actual 'news'.  I honestly don't know how I feel about it.  One the one hand it's cool that people think that what we're saying is important enough to share with the world, on the other hand it's kind of an invasion of privacy (somewhat) of our communications with others.

10gerr,6,2012-09-25,What does an economics major looking for entry-level jobs actually look for?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10gerr/what_does_an_economics_major_looking_for/,"Hey guys, here's my story: I am a 23 year old college graduate. I graduated from Binghamton University in New York with my degree in economics. I loved the economic classes there and the experience as a whole. Now that I'm on my second year (graduated December 2010) of having no *real* job, I'm getting worried. 


In late 2011 to about mid 2012, my job search slowed down. I was planning to move to Florida, but plans had changed. I worked for a beach during the summer, making $15/hr as a parking attendant. During that period, my search for jobs had slowed down once again. $15/hr helps a lot, especially when you have to pay off the $35k in student loans, plus other expenses. 


I have no experience with internships. I had an opportunity to work for MTV in Times Square, but their requirement was that I can only work if I was getting college credit, and I was told by the economics department at my university that no credit was accepted for college. So I didn't end up working that summer at all actually. 


Fast forward to today. I am still looking for a job, but I am dead set on working in Connecticut, more specifically, Greenwich or Stamford. I am absolutely against working in New York City. I do not want to be one of those suited-up people who show up at the train station at 7:45am, spend $15-20 a day to commute, and get home around 5:30-6:00pm everyday. That is not the life I want to live at all. 


I live at home with my dad. He tells me things like ""making money is what matters"" and ""marry a girl with a good job."" So to him, it is all about the money and not at all about being happy. Quite hypocritical, but that's another story. he and his friend both feed me the line that if I don't get anything now, then I'll be in trouble in the future, which makes me a little paranoid. He told me to get moving with my job search, to ""control my own destiny,"" but just yesterday told me to ""grow some balls"" and call the guy who knows who might have a position as a headhunter in New York City. I am a headstrong person. I will not ""cut my losses"" at all and do something I am totally against.


I am asked a lot about what I actually want to do with my degree. Honestly, I would love marketing or advertising, just because I'd be able to be creative. But the degree's potential itself is unclear to me. People I went to school with who have the same degree as me don't really make me think positive. One works as an insurance salesman, who during his first three months didn't get paid and works on commission. The other works at a brokerage firm who was very unhappy when I asked him what he was doing. Another works as a headhunter in NYC. The potential from a BA in Economics is in the dark for me. 


**Sorry for typing so much. The TL;DR version would basically be this: Trouble finding jobs, don't know where/how to look, what can a BA in economics get me at the entry level.**"

10g88w,2,2012-09-25,Questions for Editors on Editing Others' Work,icyrae,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/10g88w/questions_for_editors_on_editing_others_work/,"I love to edit. I love getting first dibs on a friend's story and figuring out what tools the author could use to shape the story to match their vision.

But there isn't a lot of guidance on the internet on how to be a good editor. There are plenty on self-editing, writing, how to be a good alpha or beta reader, how to find a good editor, and dealing with requested revisions and edits, but not much on the process of editing someone else's work.

I've been a part of a local writers' group for three years. We give verbal and written feedback on short pieces (no more than 10 pages), and based on the feedback I've given in the group, several people have asked me to go over their manuscript. It started with alpha and beta reads, but recently it's become all full edits. And there's a big difference between editing a large work and editing ten pages. I've completed two developmental edits, am finishing up my third and am booked until the end of November. No, I'm not charging. Yes, I know I should. Editing has been my hobby, and I love it, but I'm getting asked often enough that I know I should probably start charging. Feel free to point me in the direction of great resources to guide me.

It seems like this is a skill and knowledge set that is generally passed on through an apprenticeship (as an intern to an editor or agent) or by evaluating edits that you, as a writer, have received. I don't have access to either. I have a full time job that I love, and this is what I do in my fun time. I want to make sure that I am conveying my responses in a helpful way for the writer.

When you edit for flow, character, story arc, big picture elements, how do you convey your responses to the writer? A revision letter? Comments on the manuscript? Both? Do you do line edits at the same time, or wait until the big revisions are complete? Are there elements you emphasize over another?

I realize ""How do you edit?"" is almost as ambiguous a question as ""How do you write?"" But there are hundreds of people who share how they write and self-edit, letting budding writers pick and choose the tricks and processes that will work for them. I'd love to see the same for budding editors."
10g5o5,1,2012-09-25,I am in a very bad emotional state right now. I want to transfer back to my original university. Is withdrawing for a semester (and the W's it earns) really going to bring about the apocalypse?,Romatix,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10g5o5/i_am_in_a_very_bad_emotional_state_right_now_i/,"Hello Reddit,

I am in my third semester of college and dealing with an onslaught of personal issues. They just keep coming - my older family members are very ill, I just got dumped yesterday (probably because of the pressure of long distance in a new relationship), and a host of other things. I transferred to this university thinking it had better opportunities for me but I've been personally miserable the entire time. I can't handle travelling several hours back and forth every weekend or every other weekend as I have been right now. 

I know I want to go back now, but I also feel like I want to leave *right now*. I feel no motivation to even crack open a text book when I once had amazing passion for what I was learning. I am an international studies major, and intend to apply to grad school - although law school isn't entirely out of the question. 

Is withdrawing for a semester really going to hurt me? Especially considering it's so early in my career and I have an otherwise good record - 3.8 GPA. Is it going to close my opportunities in employment or for further schooling? 

I'm going to think about it for another week but I think I've already made up my mind. I really want some time. I want to go back home, pick up a job or internship for a few months, and start back at my original university in the coming semester."

The problem began a few months ago. We’ve been together about three years and prior to a few months ago, we had regular intercourse… 5 or so times aweek. And it was really great sex. 
Now however. He never wants to have sex with me. He loves me and he shows it but its like sex with me is no longer on his agenda. I do not know what to do. It gotten to the point where I feel bad wanting sex now. We barely have sex 2 times a month. What do I do? I do not understand why he would rather masturbate to porn than ever have sex with me. 
*EDIT:
When I initiate, he literally pushes me away every time. He just smiles and pulls my hands away from wherever they were. He initiates once or twice a month now, times when ""its ok"" for us to have sex. I'm starting to think I should cut him off. 
Also, we have been sharing a lease for a year now. Perhaps moving in was a bad idea because as soon as we did, the sex began to slow and for the past few months, its been once or twice a month. 
I really do not believe he is cheating... 

And I haven’t really changed either. Havent gotten fatty, still wear deodorant… help… anything?
*SECOND EDIT:
More to add. The past few months, he has gained weight and is taking a break in terms of career progress before seeking an internship in a lab. I've wondered if this has lowered his sex drive... but I'm not entirely sure. 
Tldr boyfriend loves me but never ever wants sex… help.

Is my career over?,[deleted],Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/10fvwo/my_first_professional_writing_job_is_writing_for/,"I ask these questions to any freelance writing professionals or union based writers: ""What is a reasonable price to request for such services as script writing?"" and ""Will anyone take me seriously as a 'soft script' writer?"" 

I just graduated from a university with a double major in journalism, creative writing and a minor in philosophy. It took me nine whole years to graduate. I did, however, take a full two years off in the process. The degree was basically the culmination of classes I had taken after I changed my major several times. Up until recently I felt as If graduating was a pointless effort only done in vain - to garner satisfaction from my family who paid for half of it; the other half I took out on student loans. 

I never pictured myself as a writer, despite the many years I spent studying it and using it in my academic blunderings. I have always worked in the retail industry, at least for the past nine years and had finally come to terms with a banal existence administrating mid-management merchandising. But this year I did an internship at a local rock radio station. Then I was hired part time to become a production assistant for a small local media production company. The project manager contracted to produce a reality tv show was impressed with a short script I wrote for screen tests during casting calls. I've now been asked to write a ""soft-script"". I really have no problems, creatively speaking or with the format, but now I have a vague suspicion that It might be possible for people to pay me to sit at a desk and type words on my computer screen. My only concern, primarily, is making more than 25k a year being a writer, as right now I'm barely making enough to pay for gas and food each week.

10fvqc,8,2012-09-25,I want to tell you all my story.,ChocolateMagic,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10fvqc/i_want_to_tell_you_all_my_story/,"You've all made me so happy.  I'm still dealing with all this damned anxiety, but I know now that it will get better.  I discovered this subreddit today and have since been poring over submission after submission. 

I don't feel nearly as alone. 

I have an appointment with a psychologist tomorrow thanks to my wonderful girlfriend.

Warning: VERY LONG RANT AHEAD. Anyway, on to my story:

I was home for winter break last year and everything was wonderful.  I played lots of games and watched lots of movies with my family, cooked lots of delicious food, and completed (grudgingly, yet with a certain satisfaction) a lot of yard work.  

It's always nice returning to the fresh winter atmosphere of my family's farm.  I had been away to college for two full years prior to this and had just finished my 5th semester with great grades in a Mathematics curriculum.  Honestly, everything was perfect to me.

But then I had my first panic attack.

On Christmas Eve night I lie down to sleep in my warm bed when I start feeling this strange feeling in my left arm and left pectoris region.  My arm is tingly and my chest feels twinges of pain.  And then the first thought crept into my mind:

*""What if I'm having a heart attack?""*

As many of you know, this let loose the floodgate of anxious thoughts:

*""Is this what a heart attack feel like?  Why isn't it going away?  What's wrong with me?  Could it be something else other than a heart attack?  Maybe it's diabetes or something.  Why is my face going numb?  Am I having a stroke?  Quick: read something.  I can still read, that must be a good sign.  The pain in my chest is getting worse and feels weirder even.""* 

MOM, PLEASE TAKE ME TO THE ER.

Tests were fine.  They sent me on my way with some Ativan and a ""Merry Christmas"" and I rested peacefully.

It was sometime later that I had my next panic attack.  Three months or so.  

I was sitting in class when I was wondering why my sternum cracked so much.  And then I began to worry that I broke my sternum and my bone marrow was seeping into my veins and would quickly kill me if I didn't go to the ER right away (caveat: I'm not the sharpest knife in the spoon drawer).  I felt lightheaded and I *thought* I was going to pass out.

I raised my hand and politely told my instructor that I may soon pass out.

Naturally, he stood there for a long moment, unsure exactly what I expected him to do, before rushing to bring me a glass of water.  

The more I thought, the closer I crept to the borderline of consciousness and oblivion.  Fortunately, I didn't pass out.  Someone recommended that I put my head between my knees and I was fine in about 10 minutes, albeit still shaken up.

That second incident became the catalyst and I was having panic attacks nearly every day until the end of the semester.  I'd have them when I tried to lie down to sleep, especially, and they were always triggered by thoughts of poor health.  My grades dropped, my relationships with others plummeted, and all the while I was adding unnecessary stress to my girlfriend's life.

This summer changed everything, however.

I spent this summer at an internship in Boulder, Colorado.  It changed my life in many ways, but in particular, it put a stopper on my anxiety.  My confidence was at an all time high and I felt like I could do anything I set my mind to.  I had no panic attacks while there bar one. 

I woke up one day with an irregular heartbeat.  From the time I woke up until the time I got to the ER, my heartbeat would beat fast and then slow and then fast again with no apparent pattern.  The irregular heartbeat woke me up so I didn't *consciously feel* anxious prior to this episode.  Hence, why I was legitimately worried this time.

Again, tests were fine again.  They gave me more Ativan and I went home.

Every time I visited the ER, they gave me Ativan and told me I was fine.  As an attentive reader, you may have assumed that at this point of the story, I am now fully aware of the fact that my physical health problems are non-existent and that I have an anxiety disorder.

Your assumption is wrong.

Some deep thing inside of me still believed that *something* is wrong, but the doctors didn't do the correct test or simply that the test was messed up in some way.  I still believed that I had a health issue that the doctors just haven't picked up on yet.  

Well it turns out that I did have one problem. 

Gluten.  

I had been having intense heartburn and incredibly bad gas for about two years and had no idea why.  The GI doctor told me it was irritable bowel syndrome which it was, but he didn't perform any further tests.

Anyway, 5 weeks ago I cut out all gluten from my diet.  I've been eating healthily, exercising and noticing the physical changes, and have been having the greatest bowel movements of my life.  It's been surreal.  I've felt for the first time what it's like to be healthy, young, confident, and strong and it was amazing.

Until this past Friday when I experienced the most intense nausea and the strangest bowel movements I've ever had accompanied by the same crippling anxious thoughts I had experienced prior to my summer internship.

It was like having diarrhea and constipation at the same time accompanied by incredible burning.  I had tried to lie down to sleep 5 hours earlier at midnight, but the nausea kept me awake.  And then I saw blood on the paper when I wiped and really began to freak out.  I woke my girlfriend from sleep and asked her to take me to the ER and she reluctantly, yet happily agreed.

Test after invasive test, they told me to eat more fiber and drink more fluids.  Oh, and they said to keep taking Ativan.

Now, this is where your brilliant narrator finally picked up on his dilemma.  Regardless, he spends 2 days suffering from chronic nausea and indigestion, loses 3 pounds, and shows up at the doctor's office on monday frustrated and on the verge of tears.

The doctor was great.  He listened to my rambling patiently.  He then suggested I have a little more blood work done and a stool sample analyzed to check for more possible problems.  But he also has a hunch.  He prescribed me Prilosec and told me to by an OTC liquid antacid.  He thinks I may have Gastritis.

It's been 12 hours since I first took the Prilosec and the first few swigs of the antacid, but already my nausea has nearly gone.  I took some Ativan and my stress has subsided for the moment.

I have an Anxiety Disorder.  I don't know which one, but it's mine and I do not expect it to go away anytime soon.  It makes me irritable to the point where I snap at people I love.  It makes me angry at myself and my shortcomings.  But with a little effort from me and a lot of help from drugs, a psychologist, friends, my loving family, and my awesome girlfriend, I know I'll be able to get better.

I hope you all can find solace in your lives and I wish you the best of luck.

Well my job contract is ending a couple weeks early due to a lack of work so it's time for me to do the 2nd leg of my LSOF Tour 2012. This is research for my next novel about a teen on a motorcycle. I rode from Los Angeles to Key West, FL for my first leg but there were time constraints involved and even though I found some good material, I want to dig deeper for my next journey. I want to ride my motorcycle from LA along Route 66 (for the most part) to Chicago and then make my way Maine where I'll turn south and hit the Appalachians on the way down before heading back West.
I need locals to help me find cool/unusual places along the way that could end up in my book. I already have Chicago covered (I did an internship there). Do you know of any places along this route that would interest/fascinate or scare the crap out of a teen? Looking for ""Locals Only"" spots. Not really interested in tourist stuff. It can be a lake, a cave, a hangout, a place with some history to it that a teen could relate to (lets say, the bridge where Kurt Cobain used to sleep during his homeless period). a good motorcycle road (curves baby, curves!), abandoned military bases, tunnels, roads, etc. Weird America stuff works! Local legends would help a lot.
If you could, upload a photo of the place with GPS coordinates in the caption (or you can include GPS in the comments section after you post the photo at the below link - ignore the email request if you like (I tried it, it still works if you leave it blank)). You can get GPS off Google Maps (I'll post a tutorial later) I'll look at the photos and cull them if needed and will post the most interesting locations on a photo map with GPS coordinates for others to see.
Here's the link to upload your photos:

Any problems, contact me at this Reddit.

Just trying something different to see what happens. Maybe I'll end up with some cool locations for my novel.

10fo96,1,2012-09-25,"I'm feeling like I have nothing left, not that I ever had much to begin with.",Feeling_the_feels,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10fo96/im_feeling_like_i_have_nothing_left_not_that_i/,"Last night I was getting ready to go to sleep. I knew I would have to fight myself to get up again in the morning. I hadn't finished my math homework, due at noon, and would need a couple of hours to work on it. My first class was at 10:10. I had to cook myself breakfast, shower, get dressed. Then I'd finish my lab write up after math ended, around 1:30, and then lab from 4 to about 9.

So I got up when my alarm went off. Thank god. 7am. That'd be enough time to get what I needed to get done today. The homework covered two chapters. I finished one. And then I looked forward to the rest of the day. I had started right. I could get everything finished. I wouldn't have any regrets when I went to sleep tonight. I wouldn't keep falling behind. I went back to bed for 7 more hours.

I just looked forward. Finishing the second chapter of monotonous problems, then crawling through the day feeling awful and tired. Knowing I wouldn't be able to pay attention in lecture. Knowing I'd be ready for my classes to end about 10 minutes in to them. Having to see how badly I did on a quiz I didn't study for. Dragging myself around campus alone. Knowing that the entire time my mind would be peppered with thoughts of a girl that I tell myself I didn't come to love, but did. Who I know won't talk to me, doesn't think of me, but my mind will not let me leave it alone.

And then to lab, to do the same thing I've done for weeks, and believe me, I don't know what I'm doing, don't know what I'm doing, and overall the process would take about 5 hours, mostly of waiting. 

Such an empty day. No reward, no happiness, nothing to look forward too. Only struggle. And everything is a struggle. Getting dressed, having to talk to people, forcing myself to care when I don't even know why I am where I am, what I'm trying to accomplish.

I'm a super senior this year. I started college undeclared. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And how could I? What do we know about any career but romantic and idealized notions? A physicist understands and discovers the great secrets of the universe. An Engineer invents amazing new machines and materials that make life better for everyone. A journalist finds the truth in the world and brings it to the eyes of the common man, enlightening us all, and healing the world a little, and keeping us on the right path.

It's all lies. I knew it. 95% of us are destined to be cogs in the machine, performing the same basic menial tasks day to day so that we can bring home just enough money to support the lifestyle the amount of money we make says we should have. 

To not end up like that, to be the 5%, you have to have passion, and a high work ethic. You have to fight for what you want, make it your life. Something I don't have, something I haven't done. 

I wanted some class I took to take hold of me. To inspire me to work harder. To resonate with my soul I suppose. Ah! So this is what I should do. Not that clear of an epiphany of course. I'm a realist. But, I wanted something to seem right, to lead me down a path. I'd take a class one semester, then two related classes the next, and then boom, I'd know what's right for me. 

I did that for 2 and a half years, and no luck. It was getting late. I had to choose something. I crossed off the list what I had already taken, and moved on to the next thing. But, I didn't really like that either, and it seemed a bit to easy, so I switched a year later into a major that was a bit more technical. 

This was it though. I really had to commit. This was my last shot.

All before that I skipped classes, put work off, did everything last minute, crammed, didn't stay up on studies. I went to Organic Chemistry 6 or 7 times out of 40-45 classes last semester. I did 3/11 homeworks. I passed. I seem to be able to muster up just enough to not fail. But no more. I know for a fact that out of everyone that took a physics class I had my second year, I went the least because the professor sent out attendance data (using student id numbers of course). My math class I'm taking I've had before, but had to pass/fail it (which invalidates the credit) because I didn't study, didn't do the homework, went half the time.

Nothing is too hard. When presented in class I usually get it, at least when I'm paying attention. I know what I have to do to do well. I'm entirely confident that I could get at least a high B in every class I've taken if I just did what I knew I needed to do. Simple things. Go to class. Read to clarify what is complicated or not entirely clear. Do the assigned problems. Don't wait till the last minute. Learn the professor's teaching style and study to that. Review notes. Nothing outrageous. Nothing too time consuming.

So why am I here? Why do I waste time on the internet, when I don't even like it that much? And I am really starting to despise it. Hell, I LIKE doing problems, but, I just don't. Can't get myself started. And it's especially distressing that today I did get myself started, and wasn't able to see it through to the end. 

This is my last chance, and I'm back to how I've always been. My last chance to make my GPA a little less mediocre, to prove that I can do the work, to maybe give myself a smidgen of hope at going to grad school (I mean, at least keeping that option open). To getting a good job, or maybe an internship that could boost my resume. But, I can't seem to do it. I reach down inside of myself for the courage, motivation, hope, excitement etc, to make it through the day, and all I keep coming back up with is a black tar covering my heart and soul, weighing me down. But maybe that's too optimistic of an analogy. Saying there's something, when there may just be nothing.

Self motivation seems to come to those that are good at lying to themselves. At least, I often feel like that when I see someone who gets excited about performing an activity not traditionally considered fun. It seems like when they express their excitement they're telling themselves more than they're telling everyone else. They know how to hype themselves up.

Of course I may be wrong.

I don't seem to have that within me. Maybe I'm to honest. 

I don't know if I can change. I know that near the center of me, I believe I can't change that I can't change. I'm too set in my ways, too old, already myself. The older I get the more it seems to me that someone who is 50 years old isn't a whole lot different than they were when they were 20 years old. 

Growing up...

I've never believed that anyone would accept me, would want to be around me. That's partially because it was very true. I can't think of a friend who didn't express this to me. Not that I really had friends. 5th grade is the first time I actually remember hanging out with people (two, and even then really just 1) on a regular basis in school. Then not again till high school. 

In 3rd grade I moved to a neighborhood with other kids. Would hang out with some of the guys around my age pretty regularly. At least for a few years. I don't remember exactly when it stopped. I do know why it stopped. I had to put forth all the effort. I had to show up to everyones house. No one ever came to get me, but they'd get each other. Eventually I took this to heart, and gave up. No one came to get me. 

I remember in 3rd grade I started to play at recess with some guys. They'd play tag. But the game evolved to everyone else always trying to tag me it. People that weren't it, would tag me it. I feel like I'm almost focussing on something silly here. I'll just say it seemed cruel at the time. Don't you remember playing tag? Being it wasn't fun, though it was fun to finally tag someone else and get that relief of giving it away for a little while. But when you change the game to making someone always being it, all the fun is sucked out. It becomes about singling out and being cruel to someone. I didn't keep playing for long.

I don't mean to dwell on stupid little incidences when I was in 3rd grade. I just am trying to understand how I ended up alone as I am, without friends or connections. I can't decide how much of it is due to an innate trait, and how much is because I never developed social skills from a young age. Were people mean to me because I didn't know how to treat them, or they didn't know how to treat me?

Middle school was the time I felt the most disdain from my peers. It's also when I think the totem pole really became well defined, at least that's how I look at it now. My place was well defined. Have you ever actually not been picked in gym? Not last, but just not picked at all. That's a very awkward feeling. The teams separate and you're left there to wonder what you should do, feeling doubly rejected.

Anyway, I was alone, really had no friends, was a weird introvert, so I was, as before, low man on the totem pole. And it's not the popular kids who really bother you. They'll generally leave you alone. Not that you're safe from a joke or general scorn. No, it's the next lowest kids on the totem poll who are the dicks. The ones that make fun of you to feel better about themselves, that I suspect are displeased with where they stand themselves. That's a cliche when you think about it, but nevertheless true. I'm ashamed to say that I was that person a few times in high school.

In 8th grade I remember my parents becoming very concerned with me. Apparently about then is when I first started seeming depressed. Before hand I was happy-go-lucky according to them. I know that I didn't see it, I didn't believe I was any different.

But how can that be? Really? Looking at how I am with people now. I'm completely closed off. There is an enormous wall between me and everyone else, for the most part. Even my family.

10fm1w,2,2012-09-25,Unique resume question,aruv,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/10fm1w/unique_resume_question/,"Hi everyone. I have a unique resume question and I'm hoping you guys can help me. Let me give some quick info. I'm a 36 year old guy that's worked a blue-collar job for 18 years. I've been with the same company for the entire 18 years, but I've moved departments once. I also spent 2 years as a person-in-charge (PIC). I've NEVER had to construct a resume, but now it's time. 

I just graduated in May with a bachelors degree in psychology and a minor in addiction studies. I had a 4.0 gpa, but due to the fact that I worked while going to school I have almost no experience in a practicum or with extra curricular activities. 

So now I'm trying to build a resume to get some intern work at an addiction clinic but I'm lacking content for my resume. What can I add for ""fluff""? It feels like any skills I've learned over the last 18 years as a blue collar worker doesn't translate well to an internship at an addiction clinic. 

Any help  or tips are greatly appreciated.

Edit: I did find this sample resume for my position: http://www.freeresumeexamples.net/examples/pdf/Press%20Operator%20Resume%20Example-0109.pdf"

10fgcs,22,2012-09-24,NewGrad (21yo) here; 3rd time failing the Amazon Interview...Need tips because I want to go to Seattle so much.,ButRickSaid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10fgcs/newgrad_21yo_here_3rd_time_failing_the_amazon/,"To note: I have read and done most questions in: ""Programming Interviews Exposed"" and ""Cracking the Coding Interview"".

So I graduated this year from a pretty good public university and had been trying to interview with plenty of big name companies (Goog, Msft, Amzn, FB, Salesforce) currently and in the past (for internships) and I've always come up short on the last interview before they make a decision.

Granted that, I've improved a significant amount each year so I know that I've made some mistakes in the past during my interviews.

This year however, I focused intensely on doing all these interview questions, practicing to think recursively, thinking before I code. I spend hours at a time just thinking about **how to think about a problem correctly**.

So I figured I had learned from all my mistakes...in the past, I just jumped to a half-decent answer and started coding it; giving some leisurely explanation for my code and then missing some corner cases. But now I learned that's the wrong way to do it. I need to show them my thought process, my carefulness, my skills. THIS TIME IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

I came up with a method and I practiced this process in my head that seemed perfect to what the interviewers want (in this order):

1) Get clarity!! Don't solve the wrong problem and get rid of any ambiguity!!

2) Write test cases; positive scenarios, error scenarios, corner case scenarios.

3) Make the appropriate sanity checks; **N.E.S.S.** (nulls, erroneous input, same-ness, size/length check).

4) Will a data structure help? Try a: HashMap, HashSet, Stack, Queue, PriorityQueue, List, array[], Tree, Recursion.

5) Write out the pseudo-code in comments first and then code it. BUT make sure to tell them that you will write code after!!

I took an incredibly cautious and careful approach to my interview, I made sure to minimize bugs in the code and try for the most optimal-time solution. Amazon seems to love HashMaps so the first thought that came to mind in any question was to try to use it. Today I found out that I didn't get the offer yet again, only this time it was for full-time.

I've tried to just jump to AN answer and that didn't work. I've tried to take it step by step, very slowly because ""the thought process is what matters, not getting the right solution"". Yet neither has given me an offer. I want to go to Seattle and I'm interviewing with other big names in the area but I'm limited by the number of people who can refer me and posting my resume online to places has not yet helped me.

10ffz5,39,2012-09-24,"Ladies, how would you react if the cute guy you pass on the street, then make eye contact and smile at, actually stopped and said something or justed asked for your number?",Thepimpandthepriest,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10ffz5/ladies_how_would_you_react_if_the_cute_guy_you/,"So this is purely hypothetical, and is something that I've recently been wondering. I moved to San Francisco 6 months ago and the amount of beautiful girls here is staggering. I just turned twenty one a few days ago so I'm getting into the bar scene, etc. 

I've met a lot of girls in the parks, including a girl I dated for 3 months,    But we always hang out, drink and smoke for a few hours. I recently cut my hair, and as happened last time I did this, I've consciously been noticing more girls looking at me, smiling, etc. I'm no model, but I like the way I look, and I catch a lot of girls passing me on the street. I feel like it would be creepy or strange to actually just stop and say ""hey, you're cute, and we haven't spoken yet, but we should at some point."" 

As far as I know, no one has ever successfully done this, but then again, no one I know has ever tried.

**EDIT: You wise women know your stuff. So yesterday I made a few of the little note cards, with my name, number, and with a different little phrase of how they had caught my eye on each.

 Girl #1 was in the Castro Street station, a really cute Asian girl who was trading subtle smiles with me as we waited for our respective trains, since she was across the tracks. Even if I crumpled it up it wouldn't make it over the tracks, though this did little to deter me. I took out a pen from my bag, unrolled it, put the note inside, and waited for one of our trains to come. Mine did first, so just as it neared the tunnel I smiled openly at her and threw the pen underhand over the tracks at her. I smiled at her till the train blocked my view, and when I got out of the tunnel a few stops later, there was a new text. #1 said I made her smile, and invited me to a place she interns at tomorrow for free beer and tacos. Excellent things, indeed. 

Girl #2 was my moment of truth. A beautiful dark brunette who I walked past on Valencia street. She was on the other side of the crosswalk and we both waited for the signal. I decided to just say fuck it and take another note out of my pocket, and smiled at her as I passed her and gave it to her, saying I liked her shoes, which I truthfully did, being Gladiatorial and such. About an hour later, she texted me saying that that had never happened to her and it was kinda weird, though flattering, but she was single and was down to meet a bar this weekend. Reddit, how did I not know this before?

Girl #3, who will be spoken of again soon, was on the bus, an adorable strawberry blonde who I was way more confident about smiling at and meeting her eye after the earlier success. But she didn't shy from it, and giggled a few times, and whispered to her friend. When I got off, I handed her a note and told her that it was 'for her eyes only'. Kinda lame, yes, but she called me not a minute later, asking what I was doing that night, and invited me to a birthday party for her friend. I told her probably yeah, if she texted me the address. She said she would, and sure enough, at nine that night, I got an address over in the Haight, and headed over. I woke up at #3's place in the sunset, let's just say I couldn't wait to see her again. Which was later today for a smoke and a walk round the taco trucks.

Girl #4 was a blonde girl I passed on Market street and just decided to give her my last note as I passed. Strange look, and no texts. I got a laugh at her face though, so i still win.   "

10farv,5,2012-09-24,Where to keep ~$40k for 6 months?,somanyjobs,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/10farv/where_to_keep_40k_for_6_months/,"Hi, /r/personalfinance!

I am leaving the US for 6 months to do an internship in Germany, and I was hoping to use the collective financial wizardry of this subreddit to figure out a place to park roughly $40k in cash. Right now it's just sitting in my bank account in my credit union, which isn't *so* bad most of the time, because if I use my debit card 12 times a month I get 1% interest (wooo....). However, when I'm in Germany I'll be relying mostly on cash, both that I'll convert into Euros and that I'll make from my internship, so those 12 transactions won't be happening, and I'll be getting 0.05% interest.

My credit union offers 182-day CDs at .25% for that amount of money. Do you all know of any better possibilities? If it matters, I am already a Vanguard customer (with some stocks/bonds and a target fund IRA - that money is not included in the $40k).

I'm hoping to use the money as a large down payment on a house in the nearish future (say, within a year or two). So, wherever I put it should be pretty darn safe. On the other hand, that $40k doesn't include about $10k that I want to keep in cash for emergencies, so it's okay if it's locked away.

Thank you!"

",[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/10f920/critique_i_dont_know_the_genre_80_1722_words/,"I am proudest of this piece. I have been published in newspapers in magazines before, paid and unpaid work. Most of what I write is humor, the two pieces that I have been paid for were erotic stuff. This is nothing like that.


80%


You don't get here by choosing it. For most people, it just kind of happens. It's what your parents did and what they want you to do. No, it's what they expect you to do. You look around, and everybody else is doing it. They expect you to do it too. So you do it. It's the path of least resistance, the least confusion, and the least risk. You're here now, almost thirty, making less than you thought you'd be at this age and wondering, “How did I get here?”

Survive high school. You think you're more intelligent than everyone else and identify as a smart underachiever. The reality is, so do they. You just don't see the relevance in trigonometry, document based questions, and literary critiques of Of Mice and Men, so you get disillusioned. End up with at least an 80 in every class because you can pull it off without studying. In the meantime, convince yourself that high school GPA doesn't matter, it's college that counts. Get a decent score on the SATs, go to the best college you can get into. Take out lots of loans. Way too many loans. You know enough math to realize you won't be able to afford college without loans, but not enough math to realize you won't be able to afford life after college with loans. Or maybe you're just optimistic.

Lose your virginity to him after prom. It was special.

Lose your virginity to her after prom. It was awesome.

You're a freshman. You get your first debit card. Money goes from the tangible to the abstract. Eat Chipotle whenever you want. Order Chinese straight to your dorm. There's rush events every night. Free pizza, free booze, and all the older kids want to be your friend. This could never get old.

There's a girl you like, and you ask her if she wants to come to this party with you and your friends tonight. There's a boy she likes, and he asks her if she wants to come to this party with him and his friends tonight. You both get excited.

You're at the party. People introduce themselves to you. They introduce you to other people. A hot girl starts talking to you, you lie about your age. A hot guy starts talking to her, she tells him exactly her age. She rolls her eyes, but you're cute so she lets you spit your game. He smiles at her and offers her a drink in a plastic cup.

Your nights end differently.

Your buddy knows a guy. You've always wanted to try, and everyone says it's harmless, so you tell him, “I got five on it”. Start smoking weed twice a week. Family Guy is a lot funnier when you're high. So are you. Class isn't so boring when you're high. Neither are you. Girls are hornier when they're high. So are you. Pretty much everything's better when you're high. All your friends love smoking weed and playing Super Smash Brothers. This could never get old.

Start smoking weed twice a day. Your schedule doesn't allow time for you to study every night, especially now that you have a fake ID and your roommate bought a killer bong. Besides, all your classes are just Gen-Eds, you can just pull an all-nighter before the final. That's what everyone else does, and it seems to work.

Work.

You should get a job. Starbucks is hiring but who wants to serve coffee to Koreans all day when you could be serving alcohol to douchebags all night? But wait, you have to barback first. Then doorman, then- ah fuck this. It cuts too much into your social life anyway, who wants to work Friday nights?

Classes start to get hard. You fail tests in your weed out classes because you were too weeded out. Calculus is bullshit, so is MCB. They tell you don't worry about it,“C's Get Degrees.” Yeah, it was just the first test. You can still get a B if you ace the mid term and the final, so who gives a fuck.

Fuck.

Hook up with someone out of your league. Spend the night together. Wake each other up, and then everyone else on your floor when you both cum. Exchange your real numbers. Ask the same questions you asked the first night you got drunk and hooked up. Start to like each other.

Your first college relationship. The sex is phenomenal. Nobody's ever fucked you like this before. Every day, every night, every Tuesday and Thursday right before you both have Calculus at 2:30. Sophomore year is a lot harder than freshman year, and your GPA is looking kind of low. You couldn't care any less about that, or anything else for that matter. It's called the honeymoon phase. She's not that great at giving head. He hasn't found your g-spot. It's okay, you figure it out together. This is so much better than Call of Duty. This is so much better than random hookups. Spend every second together, holding hands, making love, getting drunk, and smoking weed. This could never get old.

Sophomore year was a wake up call. You stop partying and study just enough to 3.0 your way into junior year. The relationship ends. You didn't think it would, but that's because you were naïve. They all end until the one that doesn't. You both move on emotionally, but not physically. Some nights it feels like the other way around. You start to realize there are more important things in life.

It's senior year and your GPA is looking kind of low. Those damn curve-breaking Asians are to blame. You enroll in some easy classes to boost your GPA. In the meantime, convince yourself that your college GPA doesn't matter, it's networking that counts. I hope you did an internship, because creating a Linkedin account doesn't count as networking. The career fairs start coming. With hundreds of companies, they all look the same to you. Bring a bunch of resumes and apply to two types- the ones you think you have a chance of getting an interview at, and the ones that sell themselves to you as a great place to work.

Your debt starts to look scary. Those numbers have a lot of 0s. When the four year ride ends, you know you'll have to start making college loan payments. But you don't know just how high they'll be, and you don't know how to calculate interest either. Speaking of interest, you might want to check what the APR is on that credit card. You've always made payments on time, it can't be that bad right? Among the many things you don't understand about credit cards is the irony that yours has the word “Freedom” in its name. But it's the most ironic thing in the world. Because graduation is here. You don't have to sit in on boring lectures any more. You don't have to go to morning lectures, study for exams or write ten page papers. You're done with all that. Freedom, right?

Freedom. Yeah, You get it now. Because you're anything but. And that's only half the irony.

Now you're twenty-four, living in your old room when the first loan payment comes. You're thankful to have any job at all, because most of it goes towards your debt. Things are tense between you and your parents as you wait to hear back from the interviews you got. Meanwhile, interest bleeds you like a fucking hog. It's been bleeding you the whole time, you just never noticed until now because the interest was deferred. Truth is, it cut a notch on you every time you decided to buy liquor instead of pay your credit card in full. Every burrito you ever got from Chipotle was another notch waiting to be cut into your skin after the Four Year Ride. The piper's come for his payment, and you're looking like Zsasz. You didn't think Freedom would feel like this, and you're right. Because you're a slave. Your chains aren't made of steel. Steel doesn't grow heavier every month. Yours do.

Chase. Chase Freedom. You'll be chasing it the rest of your life.

Take two steps back.

It's senior year and that resume is looking kind of sparse. Some of your friends did internships last year, but either you couldn't get one, or you didn't want to quit your job that actually pays. Your GPA is looking pretty good though. All that work you put in junior year really paid off. You still don't know what you want to do for a career though. All you know is the four year ride will be over soon, and interest will start piling up on those loans. You need a job to make payments, but you keep hearing about how awful the job market is. You go to your advisor, but she can't help you. She mentions grad school. Wait a minute, that's it. Grad school. You can defer payments as long as you're still in school. The economy will rebound by the time you're done, and you'll be ready and waiting with an advanced degree. You're not ready to leave the incubator yet, and this'll give you more time to know what you want to do. Your grades aren't good enough for med school. Math and science programs are out of the question. Engineering? Come on, be serious.

What about law school? Lawyers make good money right? Yeah, that's what all the schools tell you. Median starting salary, job placement rates. Plus the prestige of a Juris Doctorate. It's expensive but you'll make it back. Think of it as an investment.

Did you buy it? Did the school sell you? God can't help your soul if you went down this path. Did you know that 3Ls from Harvard are struggling to find jobs right now? Do you have any idea of how oversaturated the market is, or what billable hours will mean for your life? You've only yourself to blame, for the same reason you went down the wrong path every single time. You let someone else decide for you. You could have been a mouse on a wheel. Now you're just a rat in a cage.

This will get old. And so will [you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUt7qmSvxLI&amp;w=640&amp;h=480).

My name is Rob Braun and I'm currently looking for work. I just graduated in May from Bradley University as one of the first people from the University graduate with a degree in game design. My portfolio site can be found [here](http://robbraunproductions.com/).

The three fields I'm most qualified for are design, writing, and audio design. I'm also interested production (mainly associate producer level) as I have a very good memory and get along great with people around me.

I can also do some programming work and am familiar with C#, Javascript, and some Java and Lua.

As far as engines/production environments I'm familiar with: Unity, Flash, Construct 2 and the XNA framework.

Audio Edit: On the audio side of things I've got a good working knowledge of: ProTools, Avid, Audacity, and Fmod. I've done foley work, field recording, editing, content creation, some implementation and I've ran recording sessions with voice talent.

At this point, I'd be interested in either a full-time position OR an internship. If you want to know more feel to either PM me or send me a message through the contact form at the bottom of my website [here](http://robbraunproductions.com/).

Edit: I forgot to add that I'm a contributor to #AltDevBlogADay and the articles that I've written can be found [here](http://www.altdevblogaday.com/author/robert-braun/).

Now, as an English student, I dream of having a career in writing. 

My expertise consists mainly of creative writing (specifically stories and novels) and journalism, but combined, that equals blogging. During my free time I have worked on several short stories, novellas and books for my own enjoyment, although I hope to be published someday when I decide that I'm ready for my personal works to be public. I was an intern for a local news publication for seven months -- during this time, I wrote restaurant reviews and articles about local high school events, community efforts (fundraisers, parades, etc), and advancements in the field of technology. I've also done freelance writing work for beauty/fashion related websites and blogs. 

My main goal right now is to get my name out there. Writing is my passion, and if I want to forge a career out of it, I have to start writing for newspapers, magazines and websites that will really be seen. I'm willing to write about almost any subject, and I'd be happy to work for a fairly small salary. 

I'm located in Orange County, California, so if you have an office there, let me know and I'll figure out if it's close enough to my home. But I'm completely comfortable working online, if that works for you.

I was set to start applying for this other job until they announced this news.  Damn meeting mind fucked me.

I was wondering what you guys would do if you were in my shoes?

I'll take a look after my Chem lab tonight.  Thanks for any advice you can give me.

Protip:  If you don't have to work while your in school...  Don't.  Time flies...  Feels like I graduated from high school only a couple of years ago...  Didn't hit me how long I've been out until I turned 25."

The basics classes that I currently have to take are all either classes I took in high school, or classes that have no bearing whatsoever to my wanted career. Currently I sit around for about 20 hours a week, as well as another 10 or so doing homework that isn't teaching me anything, and I feel is more just busy work.

 If I were to drop out, and learn languages like Python and C++ myself, while pursuing internships, what would my prospects look like? Would employers care that I didn't have a degree if I had experience? What would be the best way to go about this?

I have been working in fundraising for museums and arts organizations for the last 4ish years, since I graduated from college. I have decided to go into archives and collections management and am really hoping a MLS is the best way to go around it. With that being said, I am wondering whether I should

a) Take a chance to shorten my working hours to a part time position and take an internship at a very prominent museum's registrar's office

b) Take a different full time position in arts development, make a little more money and save for grad school

Simmons is blocks away from my house. I was hoping to apply this upcoming spring, but am a little bit worried about actually getting in. I had a 3.3 GPA from a UC school and graduated with a degree in International Relations and French. 

Should I take a step back and get an internship to ensure admissions and get a little more experience? Or should I get a better paying position to help me afford school? I have also been thinking about volunteering at BPL in the weekends if that helps my chances of admissions.

I just don't know how difficult it will be to get into Simmons! I would love to work for free for a museum collection, but I just don't know if it is worth not saving for next year. Alums advice will be very welcomed!

I have a masters degree and two bachelors degrees.  I have over 4 years experience in my field, but i cant seem to get a job.

My masters is in industrial and organizational psychology, i focused mainly on statistics and research, however that is very useful for consulting and looked for by employers.  I've worked as an independent contractor and helped businesses like the IRS, Yahoo.com, FedEx, Rolls Royce, Tiffany Co., TD Ameritrade, the list goes on and on.

I moved out of the state for a while to get my head together after a series of unfortunate events that took place in my life.  I moved back 8 months ago.  I searched for a job for about 3 months with no luck.  A friend said he was starting a company and could use my help developing his business.  They werent generating revenue so i wasnt getting paid, it's now 5 months later and still no money.  So i think of this as a giant internship and resume builder.  However, the problem still stands, no money.

I feel as if the job market is hopeless, i get no replies from prospective employers, i'm 27 years old, living with my parents and i have $54.00 to my name.

Any advice?"

**Undergrad GPA** 3.34, Major GPA 3.5
Transferred to a State school (ranked mid 60s nationally by US News) from a community college (where I had a 3.3)

However being a university there are tons of people who edit their own parts of the site (departments) and what not. The university is using adobe contribute as their CMS software for editing (Worst CMS I have ever experienced). So the new responsive site when being edited in contribute looks horrible. Div's are thrown across the page and images that are using %'s are stretched. All of these div's and images are in their own SSI (includes) so the users cannot edit this content.

I was wondering is it possible as an administrator to set certain SSI and divs to not be shown in Adobe Contribute. And to only show the main content(div) that they are able to edit. I would like it so when a user goes to edit their page they only can see the container div they are suppose to be working in.

Monday - Girlfriend told me that she needs some ""alone"" time, that usually means that a break up will soon be happening. I freaked out, started apologizing and beg her to not leave me. I was in tears... started drinking.. I called her while I was crying, told her to not leave me and begged her to come back. I was wrong, I told her that her ""busyness"" is turning this relationship bad. It was just me who wanted more out of it. I was begging so hard, I yelled at the sky asking why is this shit happening to me? People started to freak out, I passed out in my bed, I believed someone checked up on me. 

Tuesday - Felt like shit, send more message to my girlfriend telling how much I missed her, I really wanted to make this relationship work. Went through day walking sadly... after seeing people holding hands together, having fun and kissing. I thought of my girlfriend... how much I wanted to kiss her and I was crying in the middle of the streets. At night, my girlfriend replied saying that she will have lunch on Thursday. I told her that I was sorry again. I called her several times, but she was ignoring it. She told me to leave her alone but I kept calling. More drinking... then later, one final call. She didn't pick up, but I decided to leave a voice message. I was crying... told her that I was sorry that I'm a greedy asshole and I really want this relationship to work. She later replied saying that ""we should be friends"" but I don't want that. I still want to remain as her ""boyfriend"". Passed out on my bed.

Wednesday - I decided to do some college homework, but couldn't think at all. I'm so sad that I was thinking about her... Something told me to send a picture of a cute cat with text saying ""I'm sorry, please give me a chance"", I send it. I checked on her facebook, she has an event that she really wanted to go, so I left a comment saying to ""sign me up!"". Lunch was painful, I was sitting alone but there was a couple sitting in front of me. They were talking and having so much fun together...laughing and touching each other... I thought of the fun which I used to have with my girlfriend. I feel like tears are coming out. I quickly finish and literally cried while I was walking back to my place. My uncle called me to invite me for dinner, at first I told him I didn't want to go and explain my situation. Somehow, I told him that I'll go. 

So far, my girlfriend is going to Toronto this weekend but I really wanted to spend time ""healing"" this relationship. I had a plan where she and I would go to a park and have a picnic there but she's going to fucking Toronto. She will be more busy soon... she's starting her internship and that might leave less free time. I'm just wanted to go to Toronto with her but there aren't anymore spots left... I tried asking everywhere if anyone wanted to sell their tickets...but no luck. Things are slowly getting bad... I feel like I'm slowly losing my girlfriend...although she told me that it's HER fault... Somehow I felt like it's just me...who wanted more from her... I'm sitting in my room and outside looks like it's going to rain...the day is gloomy. I prayed that tommrow my girlfriend and I will work this out together, I don't want to lose her... I send her a text saying ""Hi, how are you?"" but no reply... It's like she's ignoring me. Something inside me told me that she felt the same way as I am... sad...wanted to work this relationship out but I may be crazy... 

I really hate it though, she's leaving on Friday 7:00 AM sharp... I mean I have the whole fucking weekend planned out. The trip cost fucking $200, I can't believe that my girlfriend would rather spend a lot to go spend her time without me. She will be back on Sunday too... I bet she will say that she's too tired from the trip. I fucking hate this life. FUCKING SHIT.    "

And if I did get an internship offer and didn't finish by May 2014 am I taken out of consideration for full-time?


EDIT: I'm trying to say that depending on if I get an internship or not I want to take 4 or 5 years to finish. But if I interviewed for internships and then applied for leaderships in the spring would that look bad if I decided between now and then that I'll take 5 years to finish?"

My client, a sports-oriented company, is still looking for front-end web developers to work in Bristol, CT. They're awesome to work for - they offer benefits at 2 weeks, flexible schedules, bonus-eligible salary, and more. Nonlocal candidates will have interview expenses and relocation costs covered.


In addition, they're considering candidates with anywhere between a few months to 8 years of experience, so this is also a great opportunity for those with solid internships. They're also willing to consider those without experience IF they graduated from a top school with a related degree.


In terms of skills and proficiencies, they're looking for:

- A bachelor's degree.
- Front-end development experience (not design) in a professional environment.
- Strong understanding of object-oriented programming.
- Experience working with a structured programming language (Java, C/C++, ASP, JSP, PHP, etc.)
- Good understanding of benefits and constraints of current Internet technologies and strong familiarity with various web languages (any mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, Flash, DHTML, etc).
- A solid appreciation of sports! To give you an idea, candidates can expect to be asked a few questions on which sports they follow, their favorite players, and their understanding of the rules.

 

If interested, please submit resumes in confidence to andrew@css-llc.net. Thanks!"

It has been a ground for me to not only vent but begin to confront my problems. But somehow I am not able to pick myself up and and carry on. I have tried to sort out a lot of the past problems but I am still unable to cope. I am not even able to just go up to my academic advisor and tell her that everyday I am dying a little inside.

About 2 months back I confided in a friend. She really helped me a lot and took me in. But I have to find somewhere to live next week. I have been sending out my CV and applying for internships but have not even had an email back. I received an mail from school asking me why I have not registered my internship with them. How do I tell them that I am a failure!!

I failed the 3 courses but my advisor said that I could repeat them next year as I still have potential. But I need to have a 4 month internship, and since it is already end september it is no longer possible. I need just a document saying that I have an internship with something in the domain of International Affairs (human rights).

The internships that are available are with UN agencies or other NGOs that offer unpaid positions. I am homeless, I have  no phone, how can I contribute 40 hrs a week to work and dress a certain way. 

I feel like such a failure and think that I am regressing to that place of comfort that an end could provide. I feel worthless and that years of studying are useless in my case. I feel truly at a loss. I hoped that doing an internship and working in an area of human rights would remind me of the gift of life. But the very path to finding that is pushing me closer to the cliff. 

I am too poor to even afford to go to the therapist who asks for 50 euros a session. Ah, it is difficult. I can feel all the motivation being sucked down and along with it my hopes and dreams for the future, down in the chasm of failure and fatigue.

Sorry for rambling on but I needed to tell someone."
10idwv,15,2012-09-26,Looking for my cell phone,readit_out_loud,NotEvenTired,https://www.reddit.com/r/NotEvenTired/comments/10idwv/looking_for_my_cell_phone/,"Sadly, I have so many stories related to this subreddit. I'll post all I can remember and when time permits.

1. I was once looking for my cell phone with my cell phone in my hand. To make matters worse, I dialed my own number to get my phone to ring. Quite confused when I reached my own voicemail, still took me few seconds to realize what an idiot I am. 

2. This isn't about me but my dad. He wears glasses and as he got older, it was harder for him to read small texts and he didn't have bi-focals yet. He would lift up his glasses and place them on his head. And then he would go around looking for his glasses. He found out what he has done when he bent down to look under the bed and his glasses fell from his head. 

3. There is a tea shop that sells bubble teas and other beverages near my university. I can't remember why exactly, but we got our teas in the take-out cups instead of those glasses. I think they must've ran out. Anyways, after talking for a while, we decided to go. I walked out of the shop without paying, still holding my drink (having the take-out cup made me think I already paid). After I got out, walked maybe 10 meters and I realized we haven't paid. So we went back, paid, and they didn't even notice that we had left. 

4. My friend was doing a phone interview. The interviewer asked him a question, but he couldn't understand it, partly because he was nervous as fuk and partly cuz of sh1tty phone. He asked the interviewer to repeat 3 times and even then, he couldn't understand so he started laughing. I guess u do crazy stuff when u are under a lot of stress. 

5. When I was doing my first phone interview for an intern position, the interviewers asked what my strengths were. I totally blanked out and asked them to come back to that question o.0. 

6. I have close friends that I room with. There is this one guy who likes scaring ppl. We used to live in this small apartment and I went down to pick up my laundry from the dryer in the first floor at 1AM. The guy saw me get my laundry and I had a feeling that he was gonna try to scare me. I picked up my laundry, got on the elevator. Before the door opened on my floor, I heard some shuffling noise.  So I placed the laundry basket in the middle and hid by sticking as close to the elevator wall near the buttons to hide myself from view thinking it's my friend trying to scare me (the door takes a bit of time before opening). The door opens and there is absolute silence. So I thought I was wrong and went to pick up my basket when I saw my neighbour pale and petrified in front of the elevator. Oops. 

That's all I can remember for now. Hopefully I remember more. "

I found a few leads for local machine shops, but so far, the only one that was willing to pay me didn't work out (they never called back, I dunno). The other is an unpaid internship (which I'll keep doing in some of my spare time, likely, but I can't sacrifice paid work for it).

I was talking to a mechanic buddy of mine about it, and he said to do some research to find some of the bigger welding companies, since everyone needs to start somewhere. They seem the most likely source of employment. So far, I cannot seem to locate anything useful from preliminary Google searches. I'll keep looking, but in the meantime I figured I'd ask here.

I'm definitely looking for full-time work (I'd love some health insurance after too long of being without), and something within NYC for now (I'm working on getting my motorcycle back together, so I *could* possibly travel a little farther in the near future.

**TL;DR**: Looking for entry-level welding work in NYC, where to start looking?

Thanks in advance!"

&gt;Just FYI.

&gt;The New York State Psychological Association has unanimously passed the first state policy on the internship crisis. This policy is based upon the American Psychological Association of Graduate Students Policy. 
""The New York State Psychological Association asks APA to include as a requirement for APA Accreditation that APA-accredited graduate programs ensure that all students who fulfill their academic requirements and are eligible for internship receive an APA-accredited Internship.""

Putting the burden of creating internship spots on internship programs is folly, given that programs cannot control so many of the factors involved. 

Do you have ideas for addressing the internship crisis?

",Mrsteddyruxpin,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10hzc5/i_can_no_longer_mother_my_mother_entire/,"My mom has always been needy and lacked common sense from as far back as i can remember. I always thought of myself as ""the good daughter"" who helped and guided her through all of her bad decisions. Everything has changed since I have become a mother. I have to mother my son now, and I'm in the midst of my internship, I have a husband..a mortgage...and a lot on my mind and I just can't adopt my mothers problems any longer. 

Now all we do is fight. 

I wish she was an adult. I wish she was reliable. I wish she didn't live like a slob. I wish she would keep her promises. I wish she cared about her health. I wish she would stop seeing people for what they can give her. I wish I had a wise, calm, uplifting mother. 
My drug addict brother has moved into her house, and all I get to hear about is how great he is for ""helping her"". I like to call it ""enabling her"". He does everything she asks, and accepts all of her behaviors...of course his 32 year old butt is getting free rent, food, utilities, and extra cash..so why would he create conflict with her? 

I helped her quit smoking. She was 7 months quit and when she broke up with her crazy lesbian girlfriend (hopefully for the last time) and kicked her out of her house (again) my brother went and bought her 4 packs. If she's going to ruin all her progress my brother could have at least made her go get them herself. She has had two heart attacks. The doctor said she has to stop smoking and drinking insane amounts of caffeine. My brother keeps feeding her both. She's going to die if she doesn't start taking care of herself. But I can't keep begging and fighting with her about it. Either she wants to live, or she doesn't...

She has no furniture...her house is in disarray and reeks like ciggs and is filthy, so my sons first birthday will be at my dad's house. She spent our entire time on the phone tonight being bitter and angry with me about this. She kept saying ""I know this isn't your fault, and this is the only option but I don't have to like it"". I feel like she's trying to ruin this experience for me because she isn't getting to do what she financially and physically is incapable of doing. 

I am so insanely dissapointed in my mom's effort at living that i cant bring myself to congratulate her for shampooing her carpets. That's what normal people do. Set the bar a little higher. 

I can't run to her rescue, fix her problems, or condone her destructive behavior anymore...so she doesn't call..and she doesn't text...and if we do talk. It's always about her. Never me. And we fight. 

I don't know what to do reddit..I feel like I'm losing my mom...

10htoh,2,2012-09-26,My life feels so meaningless,i_ate_carrots_today,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10htoh/my_life_feels_so_meaningless/,"I'm not really sure how to begin, but I just have had this completely overwhelming feeling that I've led such a pointless, terrible life, that I can't really look at myself or my life and respect anything about it. I've felt this way for as long I can remember my own emotional state; to put it another way, I can't remember ever being actually happy for more than a moment at a time, and I can never remember ever actually recognizing that I am happy while it happens. 

I feel like I have become trapped in my own pointless cycle, doing the same things and acting the same way over and over just to get through the day. I feel completely alone, despite having a fair amount of acquaintances and people I do things with; I have a pretty active social life and I can meet new people pretty easily. I can make people laugh pretty easily, regardless of whether I've known them a long time or a brief time, so I usually end up hiding behind that and never really forming meaningful friendships. At the same time though, I have no idea how to stop being just a clown, and I'm not even sure it would make anything better if I did. I feel like it wouldn't add to my character, only take away the only quality people like about me. I'm completely skeptical about all of my relationships, and never really feel that people actually like me, rather they're just tolerating me (I have had weirdly dramatic friendship endings with other guys where they have told me that they only tolerated me, and basically reaffirmed my fears). I'm greatly unsatisfied with having shallow friendships and relationships, and I often find myself bored with the people around me, but dependent on spending time with them because I feel uncomfortable without having active social interactions (I both fear the social stigma, and actually dislike constant solitude past a certain length of time). I am also incredibly nostalgic, against all logical reasoning (my childhood was not particularly good or bad, but I definitely remember it too fondly), and become hung up on the past very easily. 

I used to have incredible anger, and I could only hold it back for so long before I would end up overreacting and breaking ties with my close personal friends and partners over petty, small incidents. I have been able to ""repair"" some of these relationships, but I do not talk to any of them anymore except for rare circumstances, and never for very long. I have deep regret for these lost relationships, not particularly because I want to be around/with them anymore, but mainly because I really wish I had handled it better and managed to keep being friends while maybe not being together or best friends or what have you. I have no idea if it is actually feasible to ever try to recover these lost relationships, or if it would be much healthier to just let them go and let go of the past. I imagine that the answer is the latter, but I feel that knowing something is bad for you isn't enough to fix the problem. I wish I could be more assertive and upfront with my real feelings, but I feel like I can't risk losing all of my friendships/relationships, which is what I envision happening when I think about it. ""Nobody wants to be your friend/date you, they just want you to make them laugh/entertain you/use you"" is what I have in the back of my head at all times.

However, I sometimes have moments of great confidence in which I really cut through the cross talk in my own head and really focus on what I want, and I go for it. These feelings typically apply to school and work; I'm in junior year studying engineering and doing very well academically, and I have internship experience that I enjoyed a lot, and have recently had interviews for next summer's internships that I thought went really well. I'll still be interviewing throughout the semester too, which is helping to drive my interest in the field. I don't really know how I managed to convince myself to take school seriously despite feeling unimportant as a person, but I really am thankful that I have that trait. My situation could be so much more worse that I typically feel that I should just suck it up and focus on doing the right things, but all too often I break and can't minimize my problem successfully. I wish I could throw myself even more into school, but I've realized that I can't really control my interest level in something by sheer will. I lift weights 3 times a week and have made mediocre progress; I still have the body image issues I had when I used to be fat (I lost 60 lbs my freshman year of college; I was 6'2"" 165 then, and I spent the next year or so building up to 6'2"" 195, I don't really know why I went into detail), and never really feel comfortable with the way I look. Outside of lifting I can't really bring myself to do any other active things, so I usually end up doing pull-ups on my doorhang pull up bar. Again, I'm not sure why I went into so much detail. Maybe it's helping me to detail everything. I have an unusually high desire to know things, particularly things about people, even people I don't know or have ever met. It actually does aggravate me to not know something, and I have to try and convince myself it's alright if I can't learn it (I honestly wanted to know personal things about somebody's friend in Boy Scouts, not really because I cared about the person a whole lot, but really just because I try to learn everything I can) and I have a feeling that that quality is off-putting to some people, people who are more private and don't feel comfortable about me knowing their personal life. But at the same time, I never let anyone around me know anything *very* personal about myself. I don't think anyone who knows me really actually thinks much about me or knows much about me. 


Oh my god I can't really fathom how much I've just ranted here. I think I just needed to say something about it, for maybe somebody, even just myself, to be able to see my problems written out. I really would appreciate any kind of input, but definitely I would appreciate as much thought as you could give me; I really will take this to heart, I need to hear somebody else's thoughts.

Thank you for your time and your consideration"

**1,452** Redesigners for **24 Days!**

I have a problem. 

I am addicted to room redesign. Now, it's not so much a problem when I am forever rearranging or dragging new [thrift store hauls](/r/thriftstorehauls) in and changing out old stuff for new in **my house.** No, it's because I can't stop wanting to re do everyone else's place too.

I go to people's houses and I think this should be there and that should be here and sometimes I just want to move their whole living room *any way* but how they have it, and put some stuff on the walls, and put the TV where everybody wouldn't have to lean like they are all on a toboggan in order to watch it. And, I really am not OCD, but it does bother me because I really, really want to say something but know *it's not polite to actually act on it.* So I end up  feeling as overstuffed as a sofa and loveseat crammed into a too small corner of a too full room trying to hold it all in.

I once found this great vintage marlboro standing ashtray. It was like a combination between [this one](http://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/m243f9a2lOVHELmnvpdHPeA.jpg) and [that one](https://encrypted-tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKDQNytxVLb_BJuC9XuG91Tavx8h3DhKNkAzW_6qFyW6HjWoO9) but not really. The graphics were totally different. It was orange and red and white, but aging made some parts cream colored, some grey and then it had the chrome top. Part of it was peeling so you could see metal under that too. There was just a touch of black. I wanted to get it for my then-boyfriend and I totally redesigned his apartment around it. **In my head**. I had all the  **stuff picked out even!** and as I mulled over going back to the store to buy it, I realized, yeah, it was rude of me to want to redesign **his** apartment. And I realized, if I got him that ashtray (which I think now, I probably would've liked  a lot more than he would) it would be a reminder of how much I disliked the rest of his bad furniture and poorly laid out apartment and only really liked that one thing. It turns out, while it was easy for me to realize immediately I hated his grandma-ish sofa, (which was not a hand-me-down btw) it took me longer to realize that I *disliked him.* (It's ok. It turns out he is really unlikable.) 

And so, it was probably good I held in the urge and did not redesign his whole apartment. (yeah, I had thought that far along- to all the rooms- even the bathroom) only to leave him to have to live with a whole apartment completely changed by his ex-gf.

But now I just found this **great sub.** People who *want* to have people tell them how they might redesign their room! Permission. Finally!

Some people [need more help](http://imgur.com/a/9C8L5) than [others.](http://imgur.com/a/QRSYV#0) There's plenty of space for a [variety of ideas for the same room](http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/z8i83/en_suite_spacious_room_owned_by_tasteless_me/) for the submitter to choose from.

But best of all submitters there really want help, and there are some awesome people giving great advice.

I recently talked with moderators IotaGamer and BarricadeLights and here's what they have to tell us about /r/DesignMyRoom: 

&gt;##1. What made you create this sub?

&gt;&gt; **IotaGamer** I was browsing /r/AskReddit and came across a post asking if there is any subreddit dedicated to users asking other users to help them arrange their rooms according to their taste. It struck my mind and I made the community. Our only mod, BarricadeLights, was also browsing the post at the time. I asked if he would like to help me moderate this community. He agreed and I made him the mod.

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights** This sub began from an AskReddit Post submitted by user /u/PropaneFitness. I happened to be browsing the new section and having already had a strong interest in design related things, I was keen to be involved.

&gt;&gt;At that point, I was getting a bit dissatisfied with my reddit experience, and the magic was wearing off, so I thought being a moderator would be more interesting. I had never started a subreddit, being a fairly ""new"" redditor myself, however I was happy to help out so I offered my assistance in helping IotaGamer when he posted that he had set up the requested subreddit. 

&gt;##2. Are any of you designers?

&gt;&gt; **IotaGamer** Nope. I'm not a designer. Well, I don't really like room designing. It's just that, whenever I have some free time, I design my own room. So that's that. Organizing things really interests me. 

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights** I'm not an interior designer, but I am a Product Designer! I am probably less knowledgeable than some of our users, but I do enjoy watching renovation programmes on TV and pick up some tips and tricks.

&gt;##3. Do you have any favorite room redesigns or ideas that either you did, or that have come up in the sub?

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights**  I enjoy those redesigns where we can discuss things with the poster, as opposed to the posts where they don't respond to propositions and questions. It really helps when someone talks you through about how they use their rooms. It makes it easier to try and analyse what might appeal to them, or suit their lifestyle. Giving useful advice is a lot harder when you are left with the bare minimum of details. I don't have a favourite re-design, since our subreddit is so new!

&gt;##4. What would you like people to know about /r/DesignMyRoom?

&gt;&gt; **BarricadeLights** I would like people to know that /r/DesignMyRoom is a subreddit where you can get constructive, considerate help and advice about how to rearrange, redecorate or otherwise renovate your room. We aim to be a welcoming community that tries to redesign rooms to their best potential.

&gt;##5. Do you have anything else you would like to add? 

&gt;&gt; **IotaGamer** First of all, a big thanks to you for choosing our subreddit. We are really thankful to you for doing so. Secondly, I do not have anything else to add :P BarricadeLights covered all the aspects I had in my mind.

No, **thank you** for a cool new sub!

Like some of the other new writers here, I am an intern at /r/subredditoftheday and need to introduce myself. Unfortunately /u/Freakazette already used my [standard introduction](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/zx02m/september_15_2012_rbeavisandbutthead_heh_heh_i/c68hvqu). 

So some things about me:

* I never, ever mastered the backward somersault.
 
* Like a lot of people I like [Mad Men](/r/madmen) and know too much [trivia about it](http://tomfoolery815.tumblr.com/post/23616288239/matthew-weiner-shows-some-love-to-andy-richter-controls).

* Of all the reddit jesuses I am the one that watches over the shittynetwork. Well, I may need to be more specific as there are probably more jesuses there too. I mod two subs, /r/shittyaskscience and /r/shittyaskhistory.
 
* And I like Louie C K as much as the next redditor, but really, I feel we could give [Bob Odenkirk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9DmZn1E05M) a little more love.

But Getting jailed by the secret police in Yemen was bad. Very bad.

[Were there any dangerous moments during a trip where you felt like you were going to die?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d771d?context=5)|I never feel like I was going to die until I got on the plane home as is usual.

[Have you guys had any experiences being fucked with by the Mainstream Media?  I'd have to think journalists that train only to take a job at CNN must be envious as shit about the work you guys do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d73j9?context=5)|People steal our shit all day long.

Taliban want to talk. We have a new series coming called ""Warlord of the Week"" and we have a line up of Taliban who want to floss. Narcos? Not so much.
[Yo Shane, love your shit. Tell me, is Vice part of a total reinterpretation and democratization of the way we receive news and updates on current events? I mean, you do a lot of other stuff too, but obviously you're getting tons of fans and followers day by day who believe that anyone with a camera has the right to report. How long does the mainstream, biased and bribed media have left until we get all our info from real humans beings?  Keep it up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7qt3?context=5)|Well thats a great question. I think that its a changing of the guard in media and its about time. Over the past 15 years mainstream media has failed us. They don't keep powerful politicians and businessmen in check, the have failed as the fourth estate. That means that WE have to take on that mantle and do it ourselves. Fuck the mainstream media, we can tell our own stories now.

How does that affect your faith in humanity, if you have any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d766j?context=5)|People are essentially good. armies are essentially bad. Armies have to kill and destroy, its what they are built for. Only when you see the wake of an army do you realize how terrible we can be as a species.

[Thanks for all your amazing work!  Has Vice had any response from the Romney camp over the Juarez story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7a51?context=5)|I have been shooting in Pakistan so I don't know in all honesty but will check.

We should not have these weapons, nor Russia nor anyone else. Iran, Pakistan, India, Israel all with Nukes? Its going to kill us all and for what? The residuals of a cold war that reminds me of children playing with loaded pistols.
[I really like your videos, but why don't you release the whole thing at once? It really bothers me when i get halfway through and have to stop and watch it later.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d72y5?context=5)|We have to edit them, much like a TV series they take time and effort and money and clearances and this one we wanted to get up fast so we serialized. Sometimes we release all at once and sometimes if its more time sensitive we edit as we go. Quite frankly I am a little dismayed by how many comments we got about the way we released this series. It was as fast as we could do it.
[When you're faced with hairy situations, do you think having a beard helps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7rwn?context=5)|Yes i think it does. people don't take me seriously.

[What are you fears for the future of American journalism? Or just Journalism in the western ""free"" media for that matter?  I would love to see a Vice guide to the fall of independent media. Hell I'd even quit my job to make it happen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7ge8?context=5)|Well I think you've hit the nail on the head.

[It seemed that a lot went unsaid in the Mormons vs the Cartels series. Was there a lot of violence that you couldn't talk about in it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7ptl?context=5)|Yes. we were forced to edit some shit down.

They all make their money smuggling so if you have a camera then it can't be anything positive so they just shoot. There are so many killings, hijackings and kidnappings that if you get caught shooting no one would blink if you dissappeared.

[The mormons you dealt with seemed extremely normal, well adapted, and genuine.  That was surprising to me given my prejudice, I expected some nut-job polygamists that would constantly veer the conversation to religion.  That said, the documentary really only showed their ""spokesman.""  Were the rest of the mormons you dealt with in Mexico equally ""normal"" and well adapted?  Did they preach or get creepy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7pba?context=5)|They were awesome. I really liked them and was surprised at how ""AMerican"" they all were. Super guys who are involved in some heavy shit. I hope they all stay safe and continue to prosper down there.
[Personal opinion on LSD?  Marijuana? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7iqr?context=5)|Great when you are 17 not great when you are 42.

Many thanks, and keep doing what you are doing so well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7nxe?context=5)|Get a camera, get a story and shoot it. Seriously its as simple as that. DOn't overthink it. Just press record and let the material do its business.  
[, i Love Vice. You guys got some balls! Also I think it's great of you to cooperate with German public broadcasting zdf.neo!  Have you planned going back to north Korea. That was easily the best documentary ever! Now that Kim-junior is in charge? Maybe ride some roller coasters with him? ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7kpf?context=5)|We are trying to set up a shoot with Kim Jung Un as we speak.

I like it. its only dangerous when you think about it afterwards. at the time you are just thinking ""fuck I hope I go that shot!""
[Would you rather be deaf or Amish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7jgk?context=5)|Erm...
[I've lived in Mexico (Tijuana\) for quite some time, and while Mormons exist there certainly is not the type of base they appear to have in Juarez.  Do you get the feeling that the rest of Mexico is aware of this Mormon conflict or is it localized?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7biq?context=5)|Well they have colonies in DF and now in the South as well.

[Did you purposefully use the term ""Mormon"" when in reality Polygamists aren't considered Mormons at all anymore? I figure everyone at VICE knows the differences and similarities. Just the title of your series really turned a lot of Mormons off. (I didn't mind.. it was all mind blowing stuff.. \)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7izo?context=5)|Well they consider themselves more Mormon than LDS in actual fact.

[What's the best course of action for a junior in the journalism professional program at the University of Montana to land an internship or job with VICE after graduation?

[Shane, I'm a big fan of your work, especially the North Korean related stuff.  I have a question about the North Korean labor camps one.  On the part when you guys were out in the woods chatting with the actual laborers, you were kind enough to blur their faces in the film - but it seems that given that they were in the same scene with the higher-ups, one of whom was identified as the local party secretary, it would have been a trivially easy task for anyone in the North Korean leadership to identify these poor hapless souls doing nothing more offensive than having a beer with you and your crew, and talking about their day-to-day lives.  Have you heard of anything happening to the North Koreans with whom you've made contact? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7h03?context=5)|The workers had nothing to worry about with our coverage. The PArty bosses did, and in my opinion they are very bad men indeed. 
[Did you feel in more danger in Mexico or North Korea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7gtb?context=5)|North Korea is more prolonged. Mexico is more BANG in your face.
[There is nothing that you have put on video on your site that I haven't loved. To be a tad boorish, did you actually have sex with those Ladyboys? Just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7p3t?context=5)|No I did not. again. there was a whole crew there. I am but a slave to the camera.
[I live in London right now and I think I'm good at videomaking, I just need to convince the rest of the world. What would you ask me to do with my camera in the next 24 hours to convince at least you and VICE team in London that I'm actually good at videmaking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10g8gi/im_shane_smith_from_vice_and_i_went_to_juarez_to/c6d7ldl?context=5)|Destroy me. then send it to Andy Capper and ask him to watch.

Then as we dug deeper it got more and more insane. I love stories like that.
[Hey Shane. I'm interested in knowing if you are trained in self defense whether it be ninjitsu, archery, or MacGuyver shit. I love vice videos but I always feel the real danger in your videos.

10hmby,35,2012-09-25,A day in the life of a Ryder Cup intern.,MistahCharles,golf,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/10hmby/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_ryder_cup_intern/,"So today was my first day as an intern at the Ryder Cup. Far and away the coolest experience of my life. Worked in the morning and stuck around in the afternoon to see all the big name golfers and celebrities. Went in the clubhouse after the celebrity round was over and got to say hey to George Lopez and Robbie Gould. Would have said hello to Jessica Biel and Michael Phelps' girlfriend but chickened out haha. Heres some pictures from the day (I tried to add some cool panoramic shots but they were too big)...

I work again all day Friday and both Saturday and Sunday mornings but I plan on sticking around after both days to watch. If anyone's there and wants to meet up let me know!"

ETA Till It's Out of My Blood, Urine &amp; Hair?",[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/10hlpw/been_smoking_daily_heavily_for_6_years_eta_till/,"I just felt like stopping a couple weeks ago (literally the longest period I've gone without blazing in 6 years, I've even found it on vacation in different countries/states). It's been really easy to quit because I just have too much work to do/other hobbies, but what I'm wondering is how long it'll take to leave my system entirely, as most of my future internships will be testing for it. I get about 30-60 min of cardio a day, I lift 4 times a week, and binge drink very heavily every fri &amp; sat night. Any insight? Should I ask a different subreddit perhaps?"

* I have a backpack and a bicycle. I don't need much room at all.
* I'm really easy going, can sleep through anything, and really courteous.
* I keep my room relatively clean if I'm by myself...super clean if I'm sharing with someone.
* In regards to public places, I keep everything clean. I HATE dishes in the sink so I clean everything pretty much immediately.
* **I have sufficient funds and can pay weekly or monthly.** As in, I won't miss rent once.
* Ideally, I only need a place until the first week of December. I'm done with work on November 30th and am planning to do some volunteer work after that.

What I'm looking for...

* A fully furnished place with a free bed. Internet is a must, TV is an option, kitchen stuff would be amazing. It doesn't matter if I have my own room or not. If I have to share a room, I'd prefer it to only be with one person though (hostel lifestyle is killing me).
* Gender doesn't matter. I'd prefer someone from ages 18-28. Your nationality doesn't matter either.
* Some roommates who enjoy having a good time, going out, doing crazy activities, enjoying themselves, and grabbing drinks. This is really important to me. I want to be able to host small dinner parties, weekend gatherings, BBQs and all that jazz.

Preferred areas...

* I'm in Glebe now and really like it. Newtown/Camperdown is amazing as well. I'm open for anything if you can sell it.
* I work in the CBD and ride to work every morning. It'd be best if the place was no more than a ~30 minute bike ride and within a ~20 minute walk to a train station. Tough to determine until I see the location.

What I'm interested in...

* Bikes, bicycles, and bikes. I really love riding and just learning about bikes.
* Live music.
* Going out to the pubs more than the clubs. I like being able to hear a conversation, get to know someone, and drink cheaper beer.
* r/trees.
* Cooking and baking.
* Doing local stuff! I've been to some of the Sydney Fringe events and I love them.
* I have no idea how long I'm in Sydney so I want someone who is just livin'. You know, like fuckin' livin' the life. Enjoying themselves and making memories.

My budget...

* Obviously because this would be short-term, it'd need to be a flat rate type payment plan.
* Preferably my budget would be $175-225 for my own room and $0-175 for a share room.


Feel free to comment or send me a PM. Hopefully this works because I'd love to chill with another Redditor! Cheers!

**Oh yeah! Because this actually happened last time...if all you wanna do is get together and enjoy r/trees, I'm totally down for that too.**"

I am a 22 year old male living in Dallas, Texas. 
I have about $12,000 saved up. I have 0 credit (no cred history), no car, NO debt (not even loans), no job. I have a desktop pc and 2 laptops.

I have found a small 1 bed 1 bath apartment for $520 a month including water that's close to my university with fantastic reviews. I also know how to cook, and I'm usually on a diet so I don't eat as much.

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated on where to look and what to look for. I'm looking at used Honda Accords on craigslist that won't break the bank. Should I pay monthly or all in one?

I'm getting prepared to begin an audit internship this coming Winter in my hometown. Assuming everything goes well and I receive an offer, how easy is it to transfer offices? Specifically, my significant other may be getting a job in a different city. Due to the uncertainty of her situation, I decided it would make the most sense to apply to the city I know the best. However, if she does get a job (in an industry where this is difficult), are most firms fairly accommodating to office transfers? Obviously, they are investing a lot of resources in me and this would not be the preferred course of action.

In any case, I would greatly appreciate any comments from people that have transferred or know how it works in practice. Thanks!"

  I was awarded with a grant that would not only pay for my tuition for school but living expenses as well. I ended up choosing a private college ( I know, I know) and just want to hear some of your thoughts on the curriculum. Some of the more expensive and extensive 2 year courses were not eligible under the grant.

The Course offers the following:
Training on Flash/ActionScript, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, PHP/MySQL,Photoshop CS6 and Dreamweaver. 2 certification exam vouchers including designations from Microsoft (MCPD and MCTS) and Adobe ACA. Courses within the program relate to 11 industry certification exams.

I was told for the 2 certifications, I could choose adobe or anything from Microsoft but was told adobe certification isn't really in demand as much as microsoft certs are.

It's a 25 week course and I hope to land some work out of it, maybe even freelance. The school also wanted me to pay $1500 for a internship but told me it was optional. I've seen plenty of web/tech internships in my city that don't cost anything.

So thoughts and opinions? I do have some previous experience with html and dreamweaver but that was 7 years ago when everything was made with tables in html.

Thanks

10kv1w,42,2012-09-27,A short memory dump of my career thus far,sysadmin_,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/10kv1w/a_short_memory_dump_of_my_career_thus_far/,"I started my actual IT career as an intern. My title was IT Intern, however I was not a college student, had never attended any form of higher education after dropping out of high school - although I did get a GED. Prior to that I knew computers and such, I was always a tinkerer, built my own, fixed friends/family etc... Got an A+ cert before dropping out.

About 4 years of laziness go by where I played in a few bands, got kicked out, bounced between places to stay or slept in my car. Could never land a technical job anywhere, local repair shops, big retail chains, it was hard to find a place to get a real paying computer gig. I had a sales job in mom&amp;pop retail where they found out I was good with computers so they let me help with their issues. Some more time goes by, end up leaving there, hours were scarce. Ended up landing a 1099 gig doing in-home PC repair for a small local biz using the previous retail experience. There was a lot of travel with my own car, eventually I didn't make enough to cover my fuel expenses, my car was in disrepair and I couldn't afford it. I had to quit after a year. Soon after, I got lucky landing a gig at another place through a temp agency as a labor worker, temp to hire kind of thing. I put in my temp time, noticed all kinds of computer related things happening all around me (manufacturing). My number came up to be hired in, I worked hard and learned fast. Before the interview I beefed up my resume and brought that with, right off the bat I whipped that out and gave my self sales pitch and if they had any type of technical or mechanical position etc that I would be interested. Few days later I got a call that they had an entry level IT position for me. I about shit my pants, I was so excited. The guy that hired me was the coolest dude, he was about twice my age and played guitar in a metal band. I think he liked me right away because of that common interest. 

I threw myself into the deep end on this one. I had never even touched a real server, let alone racks upon racks full of them, or enterprise class networking gear, or anything we would expect to find in a large business environment. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. I was fortunate enough to spend a week with the guy I was replacing to get on track. They started me out doing just end user stuff, but also some junior sysadmin type stuff. I eventually worked my way into just about every facet of IT at that location. I worked with 1 other local IT guy and often worked with corporate IT on projects. They always wanted me on projects and not other dude, he was a bad team player, I think he felt threatened by ""corporate"". I learned a lot working with him though, super talented and knowledgeable dude, but a lot of times he was a dick to me because I didn't do things the exact way he wanted them done. Very often he was passive aggressive in his communication, the kind of dude that sat 5 feet away from me and would never say a word to me. He'd email me. From 5 feet away. That's not how you treat someone you're supposed to be mentoring. I think that deep down he just did not like me.   

Fast forward a few months, the cool guy IT manager left, we began reporting to someone in corporate IT. A year goes by, no local IT manager. My counterpart's attitude toward me worsened. My hours got cut. My access was then limited. Couldn't do my job. Couldn't get admin access to ANYTHING. Not even workstations. It was justified because I was an intern. I had been there 3 years doing everything a sysadmin would do. Had to go get other dude every time I needed an admin login to anything. One day poking around I found some login script where corporate thought it would be a good idea to store service account credentials in plaintext, account had domain admin rights. Password was set to never expire. I used that account to continue doing my job for the next few months without having to bow down to my counterpart every time I needed access to something tied to AD.  

One day I get email from cool guy IT manager that had left, says he has a position open, send my resume in. Got interviewed a few times. Got the job.  

Get this: the same day I got the new offer, I had a meeting with my corporate IT boss, he says that I will now report to other IT guy. I replied with my two week notice. It was fucking fantastic! The looks on their faces was priceless. I came to work two more days before my newly appointed boss told me to clear out my desk and hand in company property before going on a permanent lunch break. At least they paid me for the two weeks.

I've been at this new place for the last few years as a sole sysadmin developing all sorts of new skills with virtualization, storage, backup and DR, automating absolutely everything I can, documenting all the things... I work with some great people (in my department that is). Once again I dove right into the deep end on this one but it's been great. I love learning new things, I love to problem solve, and I can't wait for the next big challenge. 

Wow it took me forever to write this.

There will probably be a TL;DR because this is a huge fucking wall of text. You may skip to certain parts of my rant/blog or whatever as you please (probably the -PAST- part haha). The ""straight-to-the-point"" will probably be in the TL;DR and after it.

I just want to let you guys know that I do not want to be referred over to /r/suicidewatch as I do not plan on taking my own life as I understand the devastating wake one can leave if they were to take their own life. I also am going to try to be as anonymous as possible because I have friends and family that browse reddit often. Also, I apologize if I'm all over the place because I've had something that had severely bothered me recently that made me recede back into my previous ways.

**-MY PAST-**

About myself, I'm an 2x year old guy who has probably been depressed since the beginning of high school. My parents are well off and are immigrants who left their home country due to heavy military conflicts who are living the dream in the US, so anything I do is minuscule compared to them and my problems are nothing compared to theirs. Back in highschool I was socially withdrawn, a loner, was bullied, and probably considered a loser among my former friends. I didn't really know I was depressed until I got into my first year of college. 

My parents wanted me to go into medicine as it's the best thing in the world, so I felt like I had a lot of weight on my shoulders. On the second semester of college, I started to lose motivation, started to do horribly on exams, and my grades dropped drastically. I had actually developed some sort of chest pain every time I felt down that felt like it was sinking deeper into my chest. Luckily by the end of that semester I didn't fail the classes, but it was still a D which doesn't look good for me at all and lost all hope in getting into the medical field. 

During the summer I contemplated suicide. Before actually planning it, I decided I should try to seek psychological help via the student psychology counselor. I want to let you guys know that my family doesn't really believe that mental health is a ""real"" disease/disorder and getting help is for it is ridiculous.  After getting asked several questions by some intern and being transferred over to the actual counselor, I found that this did not help me at all, as they didn't give me a real answer and probably didn't really understand what I was trying to say. The intern was surveying me and jotted down any particular notes that would be of interest for the counselor. I did not mention I was suicidal so they just labeled me as depressed with ""morbid thoughts"". During the talk with the counselor, she told me that there was a mobile psych unit and that she would call them if I wanted to seek help. I agreed to try it. As she was making the call to them, I overheard ""Does he need to be restrained?"" and I immediately refused as I didn't want any part of that and did not want to be labeled as a loony bin. This was detrimental to me as it really made me feel like absolutely no one understood me at all. So for most of the summer, I just sat around my house locked up in my room watching shows and played video games all day and night while planning how to do it. 

When I finally got towards the date, I broke down and told my parents and my brother. They seemed to take it well and was supportive of me by telling me to take a few months off to get myself back together. I've never seen my brother cry in a long time when I talked to him about it when we were driving around a few days after. I understood that if I were to take my own life, I would leave my family in the state I am in. But for some reason, they still didn't recognize that I still had those feelings and that I should seek help (well I personally believed I needed help but didn't know where to get it). Atleast the thought of suicide was gone even though I still had the ""morbid thoughts"".

**-RECENTLY-**

I've recently completed a program offered by the local community college that was a healthcare provider program that lasted roughly 2-2.5 year (I stumbled upon this program on a flyer after the ""past"" thing). During the program, I had the false sense that I had a purpose in life and that this was it. Coming out of this program with no real experience in working or with people, my self confidence dropped to an all-time low as I was expected more of myself and that anything I do could get me sued, terminated, and worse, hurt someone. I was supposed to be in charge and I'm the most responsible for my actions in what I do. 

The first real job (first job in my life) I got was rough as I was so green and didn't understand the simple tasks that weren't really talked about during the program. I just couldn't handle it. I worked part time for a few days and I felt I hadn't gotten better at what I was trained to do. I dreaded coming to work every time and slowly became more and started to develop some sort of anxiety every time I received a patient. One day, the company went out of business all of a sudden when I came to work one day and nothing was at the office. I've only been there for a month and only worked 2 days a week (long hours) and was still in their new hire training period. I was absolutely relieved when I realized I didn't have to work there anymore. So the only thing I thought to do at the time was to take some classes to complete an associates program for about 6-9 months.

**-CURRENTLY-**

After that, a friend told me I should join the company he works at as they were far more stable and more friendly to the inexperienced (same job title). It would probably be a very ideal job for many who are in the field and want to make great money while going to school. I would get paid more and had an opportunity to have them schedule work time in a way it wouldn't affect school time (I didn't want to stay in this field forever). So I built up some sort of temporary self-confidence at the time and applied for it. I got the job and was beaming with happiness. I didn't have a hard time going through the classroom training until I got into the actual on-the-job training. I did fine the first day, but it went downhill the second day. I couldn't do as I was expected and my mind went completely blank when I was supposed to be able to handle my own job (simple tasks). I managed to go through the day but I absolutely hated every moment of it. My friend saw me and shot me a text about it and told me I should just go balls deep, balls to the wall, and be cocky/confident as hell. I can't very well do that, because I just did not have that in me.

The next day, which was yesterday, I had the worst mental breakdown I've had in my entire life. When I was doing my job, I just without warning started sweating profusely, my arms and legs shaking uncontrollably, my heart rate probably increased 2x, and my hearing was going away. I knew what I was having was an anxiety/panic attack and I couldn't continue doing my job. I basically pissed a lot of people off and made a complete fool of myself. I was utterly embarrassed. I talked to the person I was working with and asked for his suggestions. He suggested I go see a doctor to see about treating my anxiety problem. When I got home after work, my parents obviously knew that I didn't have an awesome day and I told them what happened. Basically what they said in our native language, ""Suck it up and grow some balls. You're not a woman, etc. I've had a gun pointed to my head and had several instances where my life and others were at stake, etc."" My dad literally said ""deal with it"". It made me fucking feel pathetic. When I asked if I could see a doctor about this, they said straight up told me no (I'm currently under their health insurance so I have no say whatsoever). 

I have not quit my job yet, but I may be called into a meeting after this mishap.

**TL;DR**
I just can't seem to do anything right in my life. Anything I do, I would fail hard and make a fool out of myself. I'm terribly indecisive It's so frustrating because I can't even do anything in my current state. I'm always down and when I'm down, I'm REALLY depressed. I can hide my emotions very easily, but when it's at its worst, people can see it. I let people down and it really gets deep under my skin. I have a very low confidence level and I don't really know how to raise it. As seen in the ""-CURRENTLY-"" section, I've recently discovered that my mental statuses are debilitating in everyday life and I can't seem to grasp living anymore. I honestly feel like it would be better if I disappeared off the face of the earth. I have also realized that I really dislike the job I have trained and studied for 2 years (I have a deep respect for the people who do this job), but if I stop people would think I'm just a cowardly bitch and a quitter. It just seems like everyone around me tells me to suck it up and deal with it. I'm pretty sure the people who saw me that day (explained in the last paragraph of ""-Currenty-"") definitely feel that way. Maybe even my own parents would feel this way, since they don't believe that I have a serious underlying issue.

My question now is what the fuck am I supposed to do? I haven't the slightest clue what to do next because I can't even think straight.
I don't mind if any of you guys think less of me, but I feel like I'm at the lowest point in my life right now and I can't seem to get out of it. I've tried really hard to turn my life around, but failed miserably.

If reddit can help me, great. If not, that's fine too. It made me feel a little better because I'm able to express myself how I feel right now than to listen to someone tell me to suck it up.

I just want to know if as clients you've had any experience with them and what you think? I basically want to know if these guys are good at what they do and reputable or not. Their performances seem to suggest yes 

I'm a fresh graduate from a top UK university with a Masters in Manufacturing Engineering, although I have now moved back home to India (where this job will be based). I have reason to believe through my interactions with them so far that I am not the usual kind of fresh hire for them. I did intern in one of their major client companies and this is a huge advantage. It seems they are putting together a kind of leadership program and (if successful) I will be the first person on it. My future aspirations are to become a senior management leader and hopefully move out of India to Europe or the US.

10kmdh,20,2012-09-27,Got my first big boy job - now to tackle the touch decisions...,deathsythe,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/10kmdh/got_my_first_big_boy_job_now_to_tackle_the_touch/,"So lets just say for argument's sake that I have my first real job after undergrad. (Yay!)

Now lets also say that I have a mortgage worth of student loan debt (well over $100k)

I need a serious plan.

So I hit excel and started crunching the numbers. (this is the best my ECON courses at an engineering school can do for me basically)

I am fortunate enough that I have a job where it is possible to live home with my folks - which I don't mind about. I am also fortunate enough to have them take care of my cell phone (family plan) and basic living expenses (meals at home, laundry, heat, electric, yada yada). I am however responsible for my car (which I own) so gas and maintenance is on me (Which I wouldn't have any other way.

I have since begun making frugal lifestyle choices; not going out as much with my girlfriend, brewing my coffee at home instead of stopping out on the way, switching my little remaining credit card balance to a interest free promo deal (wish a plan in place to have it **all** gone well before the period ends), switched to a no-fee credit union, etc...

I also am retaining my part time job at a local deli on weekends.


So here are some of my questions:

* My employer provides company matching up to a certain percentage of my annual salary in a Simple IRA. I am currently budgeting to meet that percentage. Smart- Yes/No?

* I am currently enrolled in grad school as well. I finished damn near all of it during undergrad, but still have like 3 courses to take. I was fortunate enough to get into a program where I receive the same amount (%) of grants/scholarships as I did during undergrad. This puts my tuition at like $2k per semester I take a class at night. Should I continue this? Should I pay for this in cash? Should I take out a loan (good credit score btw) to pay for it and add it to the model I have? Also - I haven't discussed it (regarding numbers) with my employer as to what finishing grad school will afford me on the job, or even if they have tuition reimbursement - but last I checked they don't. I really don't want to put it off though, especially since I am so close yanno?

* Currently putting anything/everything extra I have into paying off the loans, starting with the highest rate first. I don't really want to consolidate, deffer, or any of that because from what I can tell it isn't very good for your credit.

* In my current model, I have allocated to make not only the company matching % contribution to my Simple IRA, but also my maximum contribution to my RothIRA (because I am afraid that the government is going to get tired of not being able to have their hands in it and is going to do away with the provision for it.) Thoughts on that? (FWIW I have a pretty sizable investment in it currently because I made the max contribution every year I was on internships.

* I have halted most of my hobbies that aren't frugal - Silver coin collecting and firearms primarily. I do occasionally buy and flip things on the side though - should I continue to do that?

* I have to commute by car to work, there is really no opportunity for mass transit or bicycling. I do want to eventually get myself another motorcycle (I don't have one anymore) to save on gas. (in b4 - deadly, gunna crash and die, etc...) My car does get decent MPG (~28 or so) for an older car.


All in all - based on my current model I am able to save around $1000 net a month (after expenses, taxes, etc...) to put towards my loan repayment on top of the minimum. As I stated before - current strategy is minimum on everything that isn't the highest rate at the moment, wash rinse repeat. My model does not take into account raises or anything, so it is just stock as of right now. Based on it - I will be paid down to nothing in just over 6 years. (in which I will update ya'll - OP will deliver!)



Am I on my way? Anyone see any egregious errors or flaws that I'm missing?




Thanks to everyone here for all the information, knowledge, and help that everyone's posted to get myself, and plenty of others like me, into this mindset.

Edit - it appears I made a typo on the title - I will live forever with the shame... :P

I also have a job on the weekends so my plate is really full at the moment.

Does anyone know of any counseling internships over the summer that I may have a snowballs chance to get into? All of them are incredible competitive and I feel like I don’t have much of a shot against the huge schools that are known.

I'm sixteen. I recently was given an internship at a company in a city about an hour from my house. This was originally a summer internship, but I really liked them and they really liked me and they offered me a ""full time"" internship position. I've stopped traditional school and am pursuing my highschool diploma through Texas Tech University ISD, and am getting credit for my internship. 

**here's where it gets fun:**

I work crazy hours. I've actually pulled out of the parking garage at 11:45 PM before. My parents didn't want me driving late at night, so they bought my older brother and I an apartment. He works in the city and had been commuting from his mom's house (down the street from where I live) every day, so my parents bought us an apartment. It's freaking awesome, and I get that this isn't normal at all. Since my internship is unpaid, (the company can't pay me until I'm 18) my parents give me a $250/mo stipend. My taste is really expensive and I find that I'm digging into my ""new car"" savings to make sure I can keep eating at the end of the month.

My parents cover:
&gt; Gas

&gt;My ""rent""

&gt;""Scheduled maintenance"" for my car

Everything else is up to me. 

**Reddit, how do I make the budget work, what are your tips on living alone, what tidbits of advice do you wish you had when you moved into your first apartment, and my biggest question, what is the etiquette on the coin-operated washer and dryers?!**

tl;dr: I'm living on my own at 16 with $250/mo. How do you suggest I make it work?"

Some coworkers have full time jobs and work there purely for the discount. One girl is a law clerk who closes twice a week and works 4 hours on the weekend just so she can afford high priced items. Is this frugal? "

10jzrh,0,2012-09-27,Is healthcare the only viable field for people who want to make a sound living and have financial independence to enter?,parkanian,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10jzrh/is_healthcare_the_only_viable_field_for_people/,"Tried googling this and finding a neat editorial or something, came up with little aside from the standard ""want to not be unemployed? go into healthcare!"" jobs-forecast stuff.

I'm asking because I just graduated from college and studied for and became a Registered Nurse because I honestly didn't know what else to do. Truthfully, I'm not cut out for it and kind of hate my job, but it was pure economic pragmatism for me. I'm good at writing, I'm a good communicator, etc, but going into law seems asinine right now. My dream was to be a journalist, but I couldn't fathom years of unpaid internships, making under 25k a year, etc. And any other liberal arts major just seemed ill-advised. It was important for me to have financial independence.

I don't have kids, or massive loans, or anything, so I know things are about a hundred times harder for those of you that do. I've noted a lot of healthcare personnel in the last few years seemed to fit this pattern - people who are just biting the bullet and doing what's in demand.

Anyone think I'm onto something? Why or why not?"

[Hitbox team: Are you guys actually capable of SSing the insane ""difficult"" levels you build?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcdm?context=5)|Hahahahahaha.
[For those not in the know, have a look: Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcdm?context=5)|^^^no ^^^:(
[This is for everyone. If you could have any 5 indie games in a Humble Indie Bundle what would you pick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtaez?context=5)|Hey, I am a huge fan of your channel!  I subscribed ever since the Overgrowth video, which has made a huge difference for Wolfire, by the way.
 |It is hard to pick five games, without revealing Humble Indie Bundle 7. :)  
 |Cave Story.
 |Braid.
 |Dear Esther.
 |Minecraft.
 |Half-life 3.
[Wait, you guys have future bundles scheduled already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dvbpu?context=5)|Not exactly scheduled, but in the works.  It can take a long time to bring games to Linux.
[What are the profits of the Humble Bundle compared to actually selling the games individually at their regular prices? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtahy?context=5)|For Rochard, it's volume &amp; visibility. Our game is not very well known and those who know think it's PSN-only game. We had a bad start last year due to PSN breach and bad market timing. Also, bringing the game to the Linux platform has been very exciting.
 |It's a good boost of cash to game sales, though obviously the unit price is a lot lower than we might get via other channels.
 |Funnily enough, our Shatter sales are currently up on Steam too, so the increased fan base and visibility on the game is already starting to have a ""downstream"" effect.
[I've heard about Rochard for the first time with this bundle and I just can't stop playing! Thank you guys for an amazing game and a flawless Linux port!  If you ever release Rochard 2 (I saw the video, there are some nice new mechanics there\) you'll have my preorder from day one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dvgt6?context=5)|Thanks for the Linux port belong to the awesome Linux team from Unity!
[HIB games have linux ports and Steam codes. Steam is coming to Linux. Do any of you have plans to bring your Linux ports to Steam?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtann?context=5)|Yes indeed we do :)
 |We will also use the Steamplay option if available, so like with the Mac/PC version, one key to rule them all.
 |Definitely. With a Linux build and Steam on Linux, it would be insane not to do it :)
 |Yes, we are hassling Valve already.
[Are any of you worried about profit lost in HIB as far as those that pay &lt;$1?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcfq?context=5)|Those who pay $1 for the bundle probably wouldn't pay $1 (at 90% off) for a single game on Steam.  Well, at least something is still going to charity right.  The Bundle isn't all about profit.  Disappointing if people pay less than $1 but that is the nature of the beast, and we wouldn't have the high volume of sales and higher payers without the word of mouth the opportunity to pay what you want generates.
[Is there any significant impact, and what is the percentage of people who purchase just a dollar or less?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcfq?context=5)|Since adding the $1 minimum for Steam keys, penny purchases have stopped being a problem.  The real issue was people hoarding Steam keys for resale, just to give out for fun, or to use for getting extra coal, like in Valve's Christmas promotion.  At a $1 floor, that issue almost completely disappears.
[Would you rather fight 50 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt8y5?context=5)|Would the 50 duck-sized horses attack me at the same time, or would they be queued like in some rogue-like?  Horses and ducks are both by nature herbivores and non aggressive to meat, which I am made of.  So either one should be ok because I don't think they would want to fight me, and I don't want to fight them.
[Would the 50 duck-sized horses attack me at the same time, or would they be queued like in some rogue-like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6du5iv?context=5)|The 50 duck-sized horses are taped together to form a horse-sized horse made of duck-sized horses.
[Is that even legal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dwfkd?context=5)|It's fine, the duck-sized horses are actually comprised of millions of ant-sized ducks, and the ant-sized ducks are just made of carbon.
[If I had a game I created and would like to put it for Humble Bundle, what should I do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt9ju?context=5)|We used Unity3D engine (which I have a strong love-hate relationship with), and they did all the dirty work for us. What we did is make the actual builds using the editor provided by Unity Linux team, test it out and report back to them.
[Thanks for your answer, another question for programmers. There is a lot of young game developers/graduates who are looking for experience. Would it be possible to get internship at Humble Bundle? Do you look for people like this? What type of skills are expected by developers like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dti6g?context=5)|You need experience and connections, but also burning desire to be in the business. Unfortunately I haven't heard any school that could actually provide you that.
 |Start small. Best thing you can do to yourself is actually finish a game. There's much more work in it that you might think of.
[How did you get your games involved with HIB?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt9ij?context=5)|The founder of our company met with the Humble Bundle team at Game Connection Lyon some years ago, probably in 2009. They contacted us after PSN release in October 2011. We were supposed to be in the bundle earlier, but we didn't have proper Linux build until 22nd of September.
[Hey, they only gave me a coffee!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtx5a?context=5)|You should have held out.
[Any news about the Mac / Linux versions of Vessel ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt9pg?context=5)|We currently have three Linux game developers working on the Mac and Linux builds, but it is still experiencing some pretty big issues and unfortunately is still not ready to go.  We were totally sure that it was going to be ready last week, but unexpected issues keep popping up, so it is really hard to get an updated ETA other than ""hopefully very soon"".
[With Steam for Linux imminent, will the Linux versions of current Humble Bundle games be available on Steam? Will future bundles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcju?context=5)|We plan to support Steam for Linux.  We've been hassling Valve about it.  Keen to be in the first wave.
[Do you think more indie developers will begin to focus on Linux because of Steam and these bundles? What about the larger developers? (I asked a similar question a few years ago, but I think it's worth revisiting.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcju?context=5)|Unity3D on Linux is going to be big. We'll definitely put the Linux version on Steam asap.
[When is the Mac version of Torchlight II coming out? Do do you see TLII being in a Humble Bundle anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtckv?context=5)|That's next on the agenda, but it will take a couple months at least.
[Hi, thanks for doing this. My question is, to nobody in particular, What is the part of your game that you are most proud of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt97e?context=5)|I made most of the physics based gameplay code in Rochard, and I have to say that's the part I'm most proud of. Originally we had quite little physics gameplay in the game, but it ended up being the most important aspect of the game in the end!
 |For me all the systems we made were cool for a limited time and them sort of just become part of the background, and I don't think about them much once they work.  This may be why we kept adding stuff to SPAZ.  We wanted to recapture that cool ""shiny new stuff"" feeling for a while.
 |In the end, for me when we get a piece of fan mail from someone who has sunk 50+ hours into SPAZ and then provides suggestions for SPAZ, desire for SPAZ2, that is really cool.  To know you touched another gamer with your crazy ideas.
 |The soundtrack of Shatter is obviously a great success and highlight.
 |But I like the fact we took the challenge of a ""broken"" genre head on, something that had known flaws, and were able to overcome them with thoughtful design and usability, bringing ""control"" to a genre that has none.  We purposely set out to do that and happy we succeeded.
 |I'm most proud that we actually managed to finish Dustforce and that people got to play it (and that some of them enjoyed it)!
 |Un-humble answer: I made the tech that let us throw about 11,000 (I think) high res sprites at the game (e.g, [here's dustwraith's generated sprite sheet](http://i.imgur.com/HH9yo.png) (scaled down)) and use any of them wherever we liked without having to budget x sprites per area, or compress them all ugly, or make them lower res.
 |Also you can make levels *REALLY* big, like hundreds of millions of pixels across, but we never used that tech.
 |^^^:(
 |I'm most proud that we were able to make a game that connected with the heritage of ARPGs, do it with a small, dedicated team, and basically provide a stable foundation for our company. Oh, and only charge $20 for it at release.
[I just wanted to say that the physics in Rochard are amazing! Did you come up with any of the puzzles or did you have to make the physics first so that puzzles could be created?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtdox?context=5)|Creating the levels for Rochard was quite liquid and organic process. Originally the character could not affect the world (he was just an observer in point of physics -- engine/PhysX restriction), and level designers were creating puzzle that did not require player interaction, like the fuses, lasers, forcefields and such.
 |Later on, when I was able to redo the whole character physics system, we we're able to do puzzles with player interacting with the elements in the world. So the designers would go back, tweak the levels and the puzzles and come up with something cool.
 |We don't have much traditional physics puzzles in the game (such as see-saws and such). There is a lot more that can be done!
[My only question at the moment is ""When will my Torchlight characters get faces?"" I love that you guys fixed the game crashing portal bug on Linux so fast. I can live with the missing heads, but it is quite disconcerting when viewing my character up close.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtemg?context=5)|That's a known issue that should hopefully be fixed soon. Sorry about that one!
[Dustforce is one of the most exhilaratingly fun games I have ever played. Although I kind of sometimes hate you guys for making a game that is so singularly, unbelievably frustrating that I sometimes want to launch my gamepad down the hallway :P.  On a technical note, though, I'll admit I'm really, really impressed with the tech (and I'm one of those snobby systems-programmer types\); it's pretty, fluid, and well-animated, and yet doesn't kill my system. How do you go about generating the sprites, and how do you manage to keep the game's framerate smooth with that much to render?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dus9z?context=5)|Thanks, that's very kind of you! I don't get many compliments on the tech, only complaints when it doesn't work! But that's just the nature of the work.  Finally sprites are drawn by using pages from the buffer texture. We don't use an indirection texture (though we did for a while), instead I just draw multiple quads for sprites that take up more than one page.
 |The sprites are packed in to groups (i.e the dustwraith ""sprite set"" above)[(another example\\)](http://snag.gy/B6MfO.jpg) using some basic binary tree bin packing, then those groups are packed in to a single ""Virtual Texture"" space. Each of those little pink(?) squares represents a page, which are stored compressed (losslessly) in ram. When a sprite needs to be drawn and it isn't already in video memory, its page/s are decompressed and loaded in to free slot/s in the page buffer texture.
[This right here is awesome. I'm a nerd for this kind of stuff and would LOVE to hear more of it. You should do another AMA some time, or some kind explanation of development (assuming it wouldn't give away any trade secrets you may have\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e32ex?context=5)|Thanks! I've been saying since Dustforce was released that I'd do a blog post about the tech, but I'm not really sure how to approach it so I never got around to it. Maybe one day...
 |Secrets bad!
[This is awesome, thank you for this comment.  I'm out of my element with graphics programming, is this the kind of thing you're referring to when you say ""virtual texture""? Or is Dustforce doing something different?  Amazing job, the game runs beautifully.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e2hmx?context=5)|Yep, very similar to that. The main difference is we're not using an indirection texture (which the pixel shader would use to look up the correct page according to the UV co-ordinates), instead I cut up the sprites in to multiple pages (if necessary) and draw from the page buffer directly.
[@maxschaefer: how did the Torchlight 2 launch go?? @Lifeformed: This isn't a question but I really love your music, your soundtrack has been on repeat since I got the bundle. :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtak5?context=5)|The launch went great! Of course there were some issues, there always are in a big multiplayer game launch, but I think overall it went really well, and people are loving it. Thanks for the compliment on the music! We are really lucky to have Matt Uelmen as a sound guy.
[Hello, apparently, porting games on Linux made ​​specifically for the humble bundle. Will you continue to offer your future games under Linux?  (I understand if Baddie22 not responding :\)\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtrif?context=5)|We've had a good response from Linux users, so we'd consider doing it again for future titles.  Once Steam for Linux is up and running that will make it an even better proposition.
[Never heard of Rochard when I bought the bundle, then played it, and loved it! Best game in the bundle, imho.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtt03?context=5)|Here's a Rochard 2 demo/preview we made last year (it uses mostly Rochard assets): [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7K8bUD_CSs)
[Please tell me you're working on a sequel!  Edit: also, thanks for the linux version \^_^](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtt03?context=5)|Unfortunately, we don't have the funding for the sequel. There's lot of debt to pay before we can continue work on it.
[Aw man, that looks awesome.  Very sorry to hear about the debt/lack of funding, I hope you guys figure something out eventually. Crowdfunding perhaps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dug7e?context=5)|Definitely, crowd funding is an option.
[Question to any, has having your game ported to Linux increased the chance of further ports to that platform in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6du0eg?context=5)|Probably. Rochard has been a test bench for Unity3D Linux team, who have done awesome job!
[If i've to ask one question, it would be : How did you get started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtfch?context=5)|Started in 1997(eek!) by getting together with a couple of friends and ordering a Net Yaroze from Sony (the home programmable PlayStation).  Kind of grew from there.
[*This question is for everyone, feel free to answer it if you want. And yes i mean your beginning in creation of indie games.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtfch?context=5)|Messing around in Flash MX in high school, tried ActionScript, found it was fun to make stuff.
[What according to you is the future of distribution for indie developers? Steam or Humble Bundle type sales? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtnla?context=5)|Both. I think both are wonderful for indie developers - the Humble Bundle gets a lot of eyes on games people might never have heard about, and the unique pay model makes it accessible for almost anyone, and Steam provides the year-round sales platform and indie needs for stability.
 |While sales and bundles are great for cash boosts, I don't think developers can rely on them alone for profitability, and they are ""training"" consumers to expect higher and higher value for every dollar.
 |Digital distribution is key, but how games are monetized is going to have to continue to evolve.
 |Why not both? :)
[Will there ever be a visual novel or racing game in a Humble Bundle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtapi?context=5)|Hmmm not a racing game per se, but we'd be interested to port GripShift to PC/Mac/Linux and have in a bundle.
[To everyone: If you could only play one more game for the rest of your life, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcj3?context=5)|Probably Civilization IV.. it's frustrating, but I boot it up at least once a year.
 |Deus Ex (the original)  7 times and counting.
 |Eyetoy Groove.  Seriously.
[This is for HIB. In most bundles, you add some games after a few days of sale. What's the reasoning behind this? Do you experience a surge in sales after doing this? Also, do those new games now get equal share from future sales or those developers don't get as much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtgo1?context=5)|I'm guessing it both adds more value and gives HIB a chance to reach out again midway through to keep the momentum going.  There definitely seems to be a surge, so whatever the reasoning, that is a positive outcome.
 |It's a way to help rekindle excitement about the promotion.  The games are typically from previous bundles that we have run, so it is a good way for people who missed bundle X to catch up.
 |The new games typically get an equal share going starting when they are added (you can always tweak or see the splits by clicking the triangle next to the developers slider).
[This is about the Linux version of Torchlight, I'm sorry, but I keep wondering about this. Please note that I'm eternally grateful for porting Torchlight to Linux, and I love the game and have played it in wine until now.  Did seriously nobody notice the missing heads (nobody even ran it once before release?\) or did you decide that nobody will play it on Linux anyways, and those who do are used to being treated bad? Would you make the same decision of releasing a broken game if it was Windows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtjtg?context=5)|That was a pretty unfortunate bug.  It is known and should hopefully be fixed soon.
[I bought this Humble Bundle for one dollar so I can redeem the games on Steam. I'm flat broke this month, so that's why I couldn't spend more. I feel guilty for doing this. Do you get a lot of people paying a buck or less for great selections such as this one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtrvy?context=5)|Sounds like it's a buck more than otherwise have gone to the Bundle so thank you!
 |Thanks! Send me a PM if you feel like your bundle is missing some Dustforce!
[Really enjoyed playing through Rochard.  I caught a really obscure Ghostbusters quote part way in; ""Listen..  you smell something?"" and was wondering what other little easter-eggs I might have missed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtfke?context=5)|I haven't noticed that one! There are a lot of references to popular culture in the game. It's not a secret, but I love the fact that the voice of John Rochard is mr. Jon St John, the voice of Duke Nukem. These characters are quite the opposite as protagonists.
 |I'm not sure where that was?... I can't remember that sentence :O.
[As an aspiring musician, at what point of development do you normally include musicians for score and specifically, at what point did they get involved with your game in HIB?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtl70?context=5)|For Shatter, we had Module involved from very early in development.  It was important to create the score as something that informed the visuals and gameplay and wasn't just bolted on.  You don't always have that luxury, but in this case it worked out great.
 |Tough to get a gig though.  With so many other musicians trying to break into games you have to be both good and persistent.  Give it a shot and see what happens. Good luck with your efforts! 
[How do you honestly feel about the people who only donates $0.1 ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dw11h?context=5)|I know the transaction costs, servers and bandwidth cost more, so it doesn't feel very good.
[Do you have any plans on adding your games to Desura? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dugjf?context=5)|Work in progress.

[You're being chased by a gang out to kill you as long as you are in the town, in order to escape with your life you have to go down one of two alleys after being chased throughout the city (being cut off any other escape routes out of the city\).  You will be coming close to either the nesting area of 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized duck.  Being wary of threats to their young you know you will be attacked, but won't die \[if you fight back in defense\] unlike the intentions of gang following you. which do you choose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e60fs?context=5)|Quick stop at corner store for a loaf of bread and a box of sugar cubes (it borders the alley entrance).  THEN befriend the giant duck with the bread and ride it into battle while leading the micro horses with a trail of cubes.  When we encounter the gang, I throw the remaining cubes and bread among the gang and let my minions tear them apart.
 |But to be fair a horse sized duck is 100X worse.

Phenomenal successes of Supercell and Rovio have made games industry more serious business in Finland.
[To the *Dustforce* crew (and anyone else who wants to chime in, really\): What tools do you use to develop with? I'm sure I'm not the only one that is curious about what the industry actually uses to produce awesome 2d games such as yours.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dxr0l?context=5)|The art in Dustforce was done in Flash, the programming was done in Visual Studio using C++ and [AngelScript](http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/).

[@snlehton What is your worst bug you have had to ever unearth and fix (in games\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e12kq?context=5)|That would have to be heap corruption, hands down. It's like cancer of software development. You never notice it until it's too late, and then it impossible to know what was the cause.
 |The worst one was having a pointer to an element inside dynamically allocated array, and the corruption happened in such situation that the array was reallocated (more elements pushed in with no room for them). Accessing  that pointer later on would have unexpected results, usually access violation or jump to unknown address due to invalid virtual table reference... evil stuff!
[My question is to snlehton. Is there any plan to bring any kind of editor to Rochard? I had a blast with this game but I wasn't ready to be done with it. I fell in love with the gameplay and want more! I'm sure you all are readying the 2nd chapter but man would I love to tweak things around and build some levels.

I have seen it in more than one company/project. When making Rochard, some design decisions were not agreed which eventually led to disputes between individual developers. It's creative work that differs from ""regular"" software projects, where valid arguments and reasoning are more likely to prevent disputes.

 |Nope.
[It's a good boost of cash to game sales, though obviously the unit price is a lot lower than we might get via other channels.  Funnily enough, our Shatter sales are currently up on Steam too, so the increased fan base and visibility on the game is already starting to have a ""downstream"" effect.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtpwf?context=5)|You're not alone :) we're seeing it too.

[I'm probably most proud of how we took what was already an unusual mechanic (liquid physics\) and did something completely new with it (creating creatures formed out of it\) and then made that the center of the game, growing the visuals, design, story, style, and music all from that unique core.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtf9q?context=5)|That reminds me that I really really need to get some time to check out the games in the bundle.

In less than 24 hours I have to pack up, get on a plane that I'm terrified to get onto, fly alone to a city 5000 miles away, leaving my girlfriend and cat in my home city, work as an intern for 3 months, in a city that has almost daily riots, all while probably living alone in an empty apartment.

Sigh.

I have always had a fear of flying, but I recently had taken control of it. I have family in Greece, so I have flown there back and forth 3 times previously, once alone. I've also flown on about 12-14 other flights in my life, so you would think I would finally get over my fear.

But this time, I'm leaving my girlfriend, who I live with, and my own cat. It just has seemed to make my fear of flying 1000 times worse, seeing now it's mashed up with my anxiety of having to spend almost 3 months away from my girlfriend and the majority of my family.

It's gotten so bad that I have been having panic attacks all day today and have been having random bouts of crying. I don't really know how to deal with this, it's like I've taken all of my anxiety involved with this and focused it into my fear of flying. :(

Is there anything I can do? Can anyone talk me down? I'm NOT going to let my fear of flying control me, but I can barely stomach this feeling of fear that I have for tomorrow.

I'm sorry if this seems like a rant, it's just I'm so worried I can barely think straight. My fear of flying.... The thought of sleeping in an empty bed for the next few months.... It's really making my anxiety go crazy."

I'm a little worried because it's been my experience, from internships and networking, that the majority of engineers with only bachelors degrees tend to do only very basic engineering, mainly doing more businessy type tasks (project management, supply chain, procurement, process improvement, etc.). Basically I don't want to become a Microsoft Office Engineer. I interned at a huge tech company last summer and it kind of depressed me, the kind of work most of the 'engineers' were doing. It seemed the cool engineering jobs were reserved for the PhD types.

So for someone like me, who has taken the typical ME curriculum with a few technical projects, but with limited technical internship experience, what would be the best way to work my way into doing technical R&amp;D type work? The only thing I can really think of is to avoid massive corporations where you are just a small cog pushing some paper around. Any advice?"

I never planned writing such stuff with the, especially not with the ""original"" account, but nevertheless here we go. It's 6am here and I feel like I'm going to write wall of text right now.


I'm soon going to turn 21 and I've been struggling with overweight most of my life. My father died when I was 9 months old during war so mother used to work 2 jobs to feed both familes, and none authoritative took care over me. And although I believe my mother is a bit more strict than other moms, I guess it's not even close to a father.


I was like thinnest in primary school, which was only first two years. Then I moved to another school, where I used to be whole day (9-5) and because of that I had to quit my football (soccer) trainings. Ever since I gained weight and lost motivation to lose it.

This summer I went far away to internship and in 3 weeks without any exercise lost about 10 pounds. I just had normal launch in the company and ate an ice cream while going home, every day. That was my routine :).

Currently I have about 265 pounds, but don't get me wrong I'm not trying to mock on anyone, I'm not looking that way. I'm not round or so. I ask ""friends"" that don't know my weight to guess it, and none ever said above 220. And usually what they say is 180-200. I've been telling myself all the time I have hard bones bla bla, but still I know I how to lose weight, lots of it.

I'm 6' 0.8"" (185cm) tall and would like to to drop down to 200 pounds, which is about 65 to go. 

My daily routine is going to college, and after I get home I sit in front of PC and stay there until I go to sleep. During weekends most of my time is spent in front of a computer, around 12 hours or so.

I go swimming like once a week, sometimes less and sometimes more. I have a really great ""private"" pool nearby and I feel I could use it much more often. Also I'm driving bike like once a week or so.


I'm not asking how to lose weight. I believe everyone knows that. Less food and more exercise. But since I'm really, really lazy I'm asking how to get things starting. I'm not eating ""junk"" food at all, rarely eating fast food or drinking soda. But I do eat too much chocolate tho.

**tldr**: 6' 0.8"" 265 pounds, would like to drop down to 200. Need tips on motivation, how to start and so.


Also you can recommend android apps for weight losing, like calorie calculator (although I never calculated calories in my life) or exercising apps. Would be cool if you could write your nicknames on these apps so I could stay motivated by watching other redditors losing weight.

I was away for 2 months for an internship, and I got homesick, but I realize that such is life.

A few months ago, I started working at a chain drug/pharmacy/convenience store, the kind that you're probably all familiar with. Because I only work a few days a week, I'm still pretty new, having only gone to work about 18-20 times.

In the past couple of weeks, there's been some unsettling experiences - one happened two weeks ago, the other, this past weekend. They tie into each other.

About two weeks ago, a man that I later determined to be homeless came in and acted ... peculiar, and I am concerned about him stealing.

I really, really don't mean to come off as offensive or ableist or classist. During my internship, I worked with people with severe mental disabilities (Schizophrenia, severe major depressive disorder, bi-polar), and with people that were homeless (who also had mental disorders). When I say he was acting ""weird"" or ""peculiar,"" I really don't mean in *that* way.

Secondly, I think he is homeless because we really don't have a lot of homeless people around here. I work in a very small town - and where I personally live is very, very rural. There really isn't a lot of crime - most people don't lock their cars when they go to the store, or their houses when they go out.  The town isn't affluent; there really aren't ""poor sides"" or ""wealthy sides."" It's a lot of factory workers and store workers. 

I think he is homeless because he came in with an EBT card (food stamps) that didn't have any points on it. He hung around on a bench outside for hours, something that nobody ever does. My store is one of about six businesses in a little strip mall, and one of those stores, the only place other than Walmart that sells clothing, is going out of business. He came in the store three times that day, wearing a backpack the entire time. He also wore a bandana (this is relevant later on). When I chatted with him, he said he travels a lot and is looking for work. 

When I say he was acting weird/peculiar, I mean like I think he was trying to shoplift. The first time I interacted with him, he was over-investigating our photo-lab machine, and when I approached him asking him if he needed assistance with anything (as I do to everybody), he started asking how old the machine was, and that the CD drive looked old.

I was uncomfortable, because I think he was trying to steal. And while I have tons of sympathy for homeless people, I also have to defend my store (and my job). I am NOT confrontational, and I don't know what I would do if I ever saw somebody stealing. And I didn't want to in any way agitate him, because he could later wait outside and, like, I don't know.

It's also relevant to note that in any given time, there are just two or three employees in the whole store. It's me, my manager, and someone in the pharmacy department in the back. If the pharmacy is closed, it's just me and my manager.

After that day, I didn't see him again until this past Sunday. This is where things got, really nerve wracking.

He came in and saw me and said hello; I was wandering around the store working on putting advertisement signs up. He picked up this box that had candy in it (something nobody at all ever does) and examined the box. Then I disappeared around the corner, and when I returned, he was elsewhere.

About three minutes later, this group of guys, about five or six of them came in, all wearing the same dark blue shirt (it said EMS on the back of it). I asked them if I could help them, and one of them came walking right at me. He got up very close, just inches away. This terrified me.

The guy began to whisper saying that the man who had just come in was really creepy, that they thought he was trying to steal, and that they called the police who were on their way, and that I should go tell my manager. At this point, my heart was racing.

I went over and told my manager. I was hyperventilating and I could barely breathe. I told her I was scared. She said I could stay in the back where she was, and I took over what she was doing.

About 10 minutes later, I go up to the front and asked her if he was still there; she nodded. I went back, and about 15 minutes later, she called me over to the window. The guy had left at some point, and she said that she just saw the state troopers pulling out of the strip mall.  I don't know what happened; I don't know if they confronted the guy, or were there by chance, or drove around, didn't see the guy walking around, and left.

After that, my manager told me that earlier that day, a customer had reported that there had been a man sitting outside on the bench with a bandana over his head ... and a bandana over his face. 

I don't know what to do or how to feel. I really wanted to quit after that, because I was really, really scared. But I can't quit, because I need a job and the recession and these are the best hours I'm going to get that fit my school schedule. I don't know how to interact around this guy if I see him again, or what to do. I'm so on edge. "

10n085,4,2012-09-28,Feeling shame instead of guilt,starburstwrapper,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10n085/feeling_shame_instead_of_guilt/,"Hi there. First off, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. Second, if I'm in the wrong place, kindly show me the door. Now that that's out of the way, let's begin.

I recently had a revelation that, instead of thinking I'm a good person who's done bad things, I just feel like a bad person who's acting normally. I feel defective in some way, and whenever I screw up, I use it as justification for these thoughts. And whenever I do something good, there's that nagging feeling that something really terrible is about to happen, as if to remind myself that I'm a bad person. I also have memories of bad shit I've done constantly hanging in the back of my mind, adding a 'but' to every good thing I've done. 

""I got an A on that test, but..."" ""I helped out that homeless dude, but...""

Thing is, I'm pretty sure I had these thoughts put in place in order to prevent myself from becoming too complacent or proud, but they just got out of hand, and now I disregard compliments, I hear blame in people's voices, and I beat myself up over the smallest things. 

I realize I've always thought this way, but only now is it starting to seep into major areas of my life. My relationship with my girlfriend is suffering, I no longer want to go to my classes or internships, and certain things that gave me purpose in life (weight lifting, playing music, etc.) are no longer doing it for me. 

I've tried talking with my girlfriend about this, but she gets frustrated about it, because I'm the puzzle that can't be solved. On the surface, I know she's frustrated because she can't do anything to help, but underneath that, I know this only adds to my guilt about everything, as I feel that she wouldn't be frustrated or upset with me if I just had my head screwed on right. It's a vicious cycle, I know, because I feel bad that I am this way, giving me more justification for the belief that I'm defective. 

The worst part is, I'm not sure I want to change. There's nothing I hate more than an arrogant bastard, and I'm afraid that if I train myself to stop having these thoughts, I'll just become a huge douchebag. This fear makes me look at myself as some scared little boy who doesn't want anything to change, which is then used as *further* justification that I'm a defective human being. I also don't want to change because I know that it'll take a lot of work, which I'm not prepared to put in. This probably has to do with the fear of change (why put work into something that probably won't work anyway?), but it still doesn't stop me from, you guessed it, using it as more justification that I suck. 

Rambling, incoherent nonsense aside, I guess what I'm asking is if anyone else has ever felt this way, even for, like, a week, and what did you do to get out of it? 

Actually, at this point, any random outside viewpoint would help. Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR Feel like a bad person, instead of a good person who does bad things, what do**"

I always laughed since the start, that the company is NEG (250,000) in equity. She basically owes over 175,000 in Payables.

I started doing bank reconciliations (today), and at first seeing Starbucks, local resturants, Gas etc...was funny, then suprising, then concerned, now i'm simply sketched out.

were talking about $30,000 in resturants, $6,000 in Spas, $1000s in groceries, flights, limos services, car mechanic, cell phone bill. the list goes on and on. (YTD, Jan 1st start)

i've only tapped into this bank reconcilliations, and the rate things are going i'm expecting to see over 100,000 in personally expenses going through the company.

This is an ""liberal artsy"" type of place, no one here knows anything about numbers and dollars. It's a small startup, about 10 people in total. 

Reddit, I need your advice on what to I should do. (other than simply reporting her to CRA (canada))

Keep in mind, 

1. I graduated from university and haven't been able to get a job, i need some accounting experience. (selfish I know)
2. boss is veryyyyyyy sensitive about everything. I told her, that her gross margins are decreasing and she told me NO!, and i was simply wrong. (lol?)

At the moment, my plan to is to talk to her, and tell her what she is doing is illegal. I think my solution would be for her to withdrawl / pay herself divididends then use that money to do her personal stuff. If she doesn't pay her income tax, I wouldn't be able to know.

Thanks.

I am in a rather unique situation, and don't have many people that I can talk to about it, so here goes. Throwaway account because she's also a redditor.


I have been dating one of my closest friends since high school for roughly 3 months. She had just gotten out of a long term relationship a few months prior. In a drunken moment back in July, I told her I'd had a crush on her since I was 14, and she admitted she felt the same. We intended to wait a while before jumping into anything, but as we began hanging out as potential lovers, that plan went out the window in a matter of weeks. Things during the summer were fantastic, but as the semester has progressed, they've gotten less fantastic. We've always had good chemistry and been able to communicate well, but lately she's been kind of emotionally withdrawn. I attribute this to the fact that she's in her last year before graduate school, stressed as hell about the application process, etc... It hasn't been until the past month or so that things have really become confusing.


There are three main things I need advice about:



1)She's emotionally withdrawn: She's always been slightly guarded about her emotions- I came into the relationship knowing and accepting that. Since the start of the semester, though, I feel like she's not communicating to me what she wants/needs from the relationship. I've been torn between being the supportive, present boyfriend, and giving her her time and space to tackle the grad school admissions process. I want to know what's going on in her head, and I've talked to her about it, but she keeps saying she needs time to process the semester &amp; to be patient.  I have no problem with the patience part- I waited ten years for the right opportunity to date her. I just want to know what I need to do.



2)Stress/body image issues manifesting as low libido : When we first started dating, our sex life was fantastic. The chemistry was great, our sex drives matched, all was well. We haven't had sex in almost a month. I stayed over at her house last night, and it seemed like the mood was right. When I went to fooling around, she said she wasn't feeling it. This has happened the past few times. I'm not looking for the physical pleasure sex brings. Rather, I'm looking for the emotional connection that I feel has been slipping away. We talked about it last night, and she was genuinely unhappy that it hadn't happened- to the point of crying. I told her not to worry about it, and I can be patient. She's considering seeing a therapist about her body image issues and her predilection to let stress dominate her. Should I encourage this, or should I leave it be for now and let her decide? ALSO: She's on birth control- I've heard that can often kill the female libido.



3)Graduate school (AKA the elephant in the room): This is the biggie. She just finished her graduate school applications to 5 schools (She's an animal sciences major, applying to vet school.) The closest is 5 hours away. I realize that it won't be for another 8 months, and a lot can happen between now and then, but I'm still concerned about it. I love this woman, and I have since I was a young kid. Without a shadow of a doubt, I want her to remain a part of my life for a long time. She thinks she won't get accepted, but she's graduating with honors, has internship and professional experience, and letters of recommendation from doctors in her field. I think she stands a damn good shot at it. If/when she gets accepted to graduate school, should I let her go (and most likely break up in the process) or should I talk to her about moving with her?


TL;DR: Friends forever, couple for 3 months. Need advice on how to work through issues relating to stress from higher education."
10mm0h,5,2012-09-28,what should I be looking for? ,dukeslver,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/10mm0h/what_should_i_be_looking_for/,"I wasn't sure where to post this, but it seems like you guys are fairly prompt when it comes to giving solid career advice. For what it's worth I've been very hesitant to ask for advice in the past since i've usually been met with ridicule and mockery. I'll try to be brief with my situation 

**Brief Synopsis:** I have an accounting/finance degree from a university where I graduated with average grades (3.2 gpa). While at school I completed an internship as a financial analyst and was an accounting liaison for a small business advisory group (student run organization, but basically I was doing the accounting for a start up business). After graduating I worked for 6 months at a fortune 500 insurance company as a financial analyst, it was a good experience and I was a contracted employee. Other than that my degree hasn't gotten much use. 


**what I'm looking for:** I'm not looking to get my cpa and i'm definitely not looking to work for the big 4 or anything. I realize they're way out of my league. I don't really have high expectations, all I really want is a job that is related to accounting or finance, really anything even vaguely connected. I want to put my degree to use. I really didn't mind my work as an analyst and i'd be fine doing something similar (data entry perhaps). I just want to build my resume and get my foot in the door somewhere doing something. In the meantime i've been applying to places such as Best Buy and Gamestop but I haven't had much luck with those sorts of gigs either. I worked as a cook in the past and i've considered going back into that work much to my chagrin. 

**what I need help with:** basically I want to know what i'm qualified for and what I should be doing to better my chances of getting hired (I know i'm not the bell of the ball in terms of candidates, even just looking on this subreddit has made me feel pretty low on the totem pole). I'm with a bunch of temp agencies and I try to apply to at least 20 places a week, but that varies. My networking skills aren't great, admittedly, and i'm a pretty bland interviewee but i'm working on it. My resume is fine and it's been revamped many times but i'd be more than happy to PM it to someone if they wanted to look at it. 

Any help at all would be much appreciated and I can spare some more details if need be. I hope this wasn't too long to read. I really appreciate any responses and most of all your time. Thanks! "

Anyone else agrees?,historymajrguy,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/10m8nj/the_average_person_undervalues_history_and_knows/,"I'm a History Major at Rutgers University and I hate how much shit I get for it. I've learn how to write great and conduct research. Every internship I've had all my employers loved me due to my work ethic/writing ability and I'm fairly sure I have a range of jobs when I graduate (yes on the lower end of the scale... 35k to 40k.. but It's a job doing political consulting or paralegal work. I like both). 

But don't people underestimate the importance of knowing history? I know all these engineering majors who don't understand how much of an influence religion has on our world, from the past to present. They walk around, placing opinions on American politics, without drawing correlations with the mistakes of Roman empire (Which is strikingly similiar!)

I'm able to engage and relate to foreign people quickly due to my understanding of cultural differences and history.


History has done so much for me. The more you love it, the more you realize it's a game of thrones. Why would you read that fiction novel (game of thrones) when you're living in one?"

Has anyone here interned with them? Will they take a non-jew?(honest question, they would obviously be hesitate to take someone who has no cultural/ethnically ties to the conflict). 

Why do people consider them anti-israel? They just take a very hard stance on peace negotiations and I take that stance aswell. I believe it's Americas interest to secure peace in the region asap, rather then take a very strong allegiance in supporting israel whatever they do. (though, obviously, we should side with israel if any type of war starts. Israel has a lot of problems but has the best potential/best representation of a great democratic country)"

I want to hear from both sides of the fence. 

I'm a Junior EE that wants to specialize in RF, more specifically software defined radios, cognitive radio, current digital modulations, wireless networks, antenna design, and other new radio technology. But, there's no way I can finish school in a timely manner and take courses in programming, computer engineering, as well as our schools 10 RF-relevant EE electives and required but retarded humanities electives (and I don't mean that in a demeaning way). Even without dual majoring in EE/CpE, I will have to take an extra semester.

I was dissed at the recent career fair, not getting any interviews for internships before all the companies flew out mid-week. My GPA is 3.08, that's probably why, aside from my extensive leadership, writing, and communication skills, and experience in the RF field through Amateur Radio. If it wasn't for those damn math classes taken during the worst possible time in my life...

So I need advice on RF engineering. What is the industry like? What classes and experience do I need? Should have I picked a different school (blame money for keeping me in state and at a very affordable school)? Should I dual major, and give up free time and extra curricular fun, or just go EE and graduate on time? Should I pick a niche in the RF field (I really dig antenna design &amp; propagation)? And why so serious with the GPA, employers?

Finally, grad school, good or bad? I'm getting the vibe that I'm doomed for it because of my propensity to learn and that I'm way too good at writing papers and teaching. My opinion is NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE based on the stress grad students take on, how hard it will be to get into with a sub 3.5 GPA, and the outlooks of masters degrees in general.

10lure,0,2012-09-28,Haven't worked since June '11.  But have been on a Non-profits international executive board since then.  How do I list this? (career fair tomorrow),morgendonner,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/10lure/havent_worked_since_june_11_but_have_been_on_a/,"Hi everyone,

I need some help fast.  I'm trying to fix up my resume a bit for tomorrow when I'm going to a career fair at my alma mater.  Long story short, I graduated in 2010.  I started working right after (summer internship then an unrelated job).  I ended up quitting my job in June 2011.  Since then I've been kind of wandering life lost and unsure what to do with myself.

The one thing I have done since then, is I've been on the exec board for my fraternity (an international engineering social &amp; professional Fraternity).  It's a volunteer position, but I'm capable of talking about it at a pretty high level capacity.  Essentially I oversee the east coast of our Chapters, and while there's a fraternal name for it, I've dubbed it as a ""regional director"" position because that's the best name I can put to it.

My question is this: What should my work experience order be?  Should I list my fraternity position on the top as it is my most recent experience?  Or should I list my last real job first and the fraternity second?  or list the fraternity in another section all together?

Also should I list in my job title for the fraternity that it is a volunteer position?

Edit: Here's my resume as it stands.  Currently I have the real job first. http://imgur.com/X05XH"
10lu16,2,2012-09-28,21 &amp; forced to take a gap year. Having a hard time planning out my near future. Assistance?,Gooeybanana,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10lu16/21_forced_to_take_a_gap_year_having_a_hard_time/,"Okay, so I originally had planned to transfer to a university this year to continue my course in dietetics(junior). Unfortunately, I somehow was left oblivious to the loan world and what credit exactly was, coupled with my parents being bankrupt = no cosigner, so I could not take out a sizable loan to pay off the remaining amount of tuition needed for this year. Since finding this out, I've gotten a credit card and I'm beginning to make diligent payments to build up a satisfactory credit score. I'm left with some decisions to make over the course of this next year until I'm ready to get back into college again.

I went through a shit storm of a summer and came to the realization that I would be FAR better off in my studies if I was moved out during the time I was in school. I love my parents' house that I've been raised in all of my life, but the noise issue(little bro w/ a disability; loves having everything loud, among all the other loud noises echoing throughout the house) is becoming an unbearable distraction that ultimately ends up with me fuming out of the house without getting much done. Obviously, money becomes an issue though if I move out. It becomes even a bigger issue after I graduate if I want to move.

If I were to move out, working 40 hours a week would be required. When I informed my adviser that I'd be working this much and doing 12 credit hours a semester(doing 12 already makes it 3 more years instead of 2 to graduate), she almost literally shat bricks...which honestly confused me. Doesn't every student do this now? Regardless, I firmly believe that the convenience of silence &amp; less traveling(would be moving closer to work &amp; with a friend I commonly hang with) would make studying much more of a breeze.

What stumps me, though, is how I'll participate in extracurricular activities for my dietetics course. With all this time spent working and studying, I just don't see free time to do anything else that might help get my name out in the field, or on a comparable experience-level as my classmates. For anyone in this profession already, I'd greatly appreciate hearing your input if you had a comparably stressful schedule yet were still able to do extracurricular activities :)

I have a local hospital that has a dietary aide position available that only offers part time, weekend hours which would be awesome for experience...but my full time job has a rather strict schedule that wouldn't really allow me to take weekends off as I'm absolutely needed on those days. The only thing really keeping me at this job is the nice pay which would greatly help with rent and bills. The Carpal Tunnel Syndrome that's developing from it, however, is beginning to make me reconsider if I should change my current path and pursue this hospital position, and perhaps find another job to get back up to 40 hours.

Everything I've mentioned seems to have linked itself in some way with one another, and it's left me confused on what I should do next. I really need to succeed these next few years when I go to college as internship acceptance appears to be pretty competitive, but I also need to find a way to make it through it all while still having money to my name. It would help me immensely if others could provide advice on what to do based off of personal experience or what have you :D

tl;dr: Forced gap year. Building credit. Want to move out because it = calmer me and more productive studying. Moving out also = money problems. Trying to find the best solution to having peaceful study sessions in order to get good grades while still maintaining money to accommodate daily needs. Questioning current job &amp; wondering about extracurricular possibilities.

I am trying to decide between Austin, Texas, and Hamburg, Germany. I am a 19 year old female human, and I am/have been incredibly interested in film/cinema (for as long as I can remember). I recently began dating a guy here, who, incredibly, completely separately from me, decided to move to Austin next year with his friends.

I have been going to the university in my college town for a year and a half. I grew up here, and my parents still live in town as well. My first year was incredibly difficult for social/personal reasons, and I ended up incredibly depressed at the end of the school year but still managed to end the year with a respectable gpa. I decided to change my outlook and learn to be happy by myself (I ended my year-long relationship so I could rely on myself more) and went on a month-long solo trip to Europe. I visited my German family in Hamburg, where I would stay next year if I decided to move there, and travelled down through Switzerland and Italy. I speak fluent German.

Prior to anything in my life going awry, about a year and a half ago, I began thinking about moving to Austin to continue my studies at University of Texas, Austin. Because I am poor I plan on moving there and working for a year to save money and so I can become a Texas citizen and receive in-state tuition the next year.

So either place I would attempt to continue my education about film and cinema, although in Austin it would be more university oriented, whereas in Hamburg I would attempt to get an internship with a smaller film production company where my father is friends with the owners (so I believe I have a reasonable chance at an internship there).

Please please ask me questions. I sincerely hope that I posted this in the correct subreddit! Also sorry if I included too much back-story. Opinions are welcome as well.

I have a close friend from high school who is diagnosed OCD. She has alway been a go getter. She was the valedictorian, class president, had a close group of friends, not to mention she is beautiful. Over the summer she had an internship out of the country and It was tough on her (homesick etc.). I actually visited her while she was there and while she said it was tough she seemed to be thriving. After I left she started to have a breakdown and ended up coming back early.

Since she came back she completely fell out of contact with everyone.  She didn't go back to school, and after running into a member of her family I found out she hasn't left her house in months. Almost no one, outside of a few close friends, are aware that she even has OCD let alone why she hasn't left her house in months.

I want to make sure she knows I am here for her without making her feel worse about her situation. One of our other friends has, on a few occasions, tried to contact her and either had no response or just a couple words. I feel awful for her and I want to do whatever I can to help her get back on the right track. She has so much potential and has a great future ahead of her if she can just pull out of this funk.

Thanks for all of your help.

I've tried this at /keepwriting but it doesn't seem to be that active. I've also posted this in the /motorcycles Reddit.
Well my job contract is ending a couple weeks early due to a lack of work so it's time for me to do the 2nd leg of my LSOF Tour 2012. This is research for my next novel about a teen on a motorcycle. I rode from Los Angeles to Key West, FL for my first leg but there were time constraints involved and even though I found some good material, I want to dig deeper for my next journey. I want to ride my motorcycle from LA along Route 66 (for the most part) to Chicago and then make my way Maine where I'll turn south and hit the Appalachians on the way down before heading back West. I need locals to help me find cool/unusual places along the way that could end up in my book. I already have Chicago covered (I did an internship there). Do you know of any places along this route that would interest/fascinate or scare the crap out of a teen? Looking for ""Locals Only"" spots. Not really interested in tourist stuff. It can be a lake, a cave, a hangout, a place with some history to it that a teen could relate to (lets say, the bridge where Kurt Cobain used to sleep during his homeless period). a good motorcycle road (curves baby, curves!), abandoned military bases, tunnels, roads, etc. Weird America stuff works! Local legends would help a lot. If you could, upload a photo of the place with GPS coordinates in the caption (or you can include GPS in the comments section after you post the photo at the below link - ignore the email request if you like (I tried it, it still works if you leave it blank)). You can get GPS off Google Maps (I'll post a tutorial later) I'll look at the photos and cull them if needed and will post the most interesting locations on a photo map with GPS coordinates for others to see. Here's the link to upload your photos:

We were eating at a restaurant down the street, discussing our expectations. I thought somewhere between 12 and 25 people would show up and it would be pretty awkward. Geoff left first to go to the theatre because no one would recognize him and I'll never forget the frantic phone call we received a few minutes later. The line-up was down and around the block. Nearly 800 people showed up. It's one thing to see numbers on a website and another entirely to see all those people in real life. We ended up having to run through the crowd with hoodies pulled down, panicking as we heard shouts of ""There they are!!"". Afterwards I tried to escape via the back door but it didn't work. We started getting swarmed from all around and my flight instinct kicked in and I just started running. I got stopped and swarmed in the middle of the street and luckily one of the larger fans recognized I was terrified and screamed at everyone to give me room. I spent three hours signing every last autograph and, for one moment in my life, felt like Brad Pitt. Afterwards we went to eat at an all-night diner and everything was back to normal; no one knew who the fuck I was. I didn't slept for two days. (also, man I wish I knew how to carriage-return on Reddit...)
[Why is Dave so pro at cooking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e85eq?context=5)|Because he's the pickiest eater I've ever met. Not picky in the sense that he only eats a specific variety of foods, but in the sense that quality is everything and almost nothing meets his standards, forcing him to cook for himself.
[Were you happy the way the TV series turned out? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7xvg?context=5)|Yes, I am happy with how it turned out, especially given the obstacles involved in making a real 'TV' show. Constant network revisions, writers/directors forced onto the project, 14 hour days with no downtime, etc. If you compare it to other TV comedies (and not our previous web series), I think it stands up. But then again, I think most modern TV comedies are pure crap, with rare exceptions like 'Louie' on FX or 'Limmy's Show' on BBC Scotland. I think a big problem for our existing fan base is that they had a strong expectation of what it would be, and when the structure and tone was changed...  well, people don't like changes to the things they love. In a perfect world, they'd have given us full creative control and I think we would have knocked it out of the park for old fans and new.
[Which episodes of PP (web series\) were the most fun or memorable to film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7x3i?context=5)|Episode 2 was a blast to film because it involved drinking a few pitchers of beer and randomly interacting in-character with people on the street. Those were the days.
 |Episode 10 is my most memorable because I took the writing more seriously than the other episodes and felt that we really, really needed a solid episode (and return to our 'roots') after experimenting with 'micro balls' in episode 9. The opening scene is a personal favourite - sitting alone in my underwear and doing 57 takes until I felt I nailed it. That is actually me typing... 
[How many famous people do you know of that liked Pure Pwnage a lot, and how did you find out? (Like Artosis from the SC-scene\)  PP Teh Movie has been an idea you and Geoff have thrown around for many years now, but when was it decided ""Fuck it, let's crowdfund it!""? Was it a spontaneous decision just recently after you started being more public, or have it been in the works for quite some time already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7z5u?context=5)|Not sure how many in total, but I've been surprised how many big figures in eSports have reached out to me, especially after the IEM event and/or the movie announcement.  A lot of casters (Tasteless, Artosis, Day9 and more) and players (Sheth, Destiny, HuK and more), of which I will certainly forget some if I try to list them.  I've known dApollo since the days when EA would fly us out to balance-test the Alpha versions of new C&amp;C games. The actor Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom in the Harry Potter films) is a fan and in fact one of the first people to buy an 'i pwn n00bs' shirt from us back in the day. Apparently he used to wear it to set. I met him in Calgary and we mutually freaked out (I'm a big Harry Potter fan).  I love my family life. In all honesty, I was terrified I might be a bad dad, given my predisposition to obsess about work or games, but as it turns out I was born to be one. It's funny how our instincts work. I am completely obsessed with my son and it kills me to spend any time away (the IEM Germany trip was my first time away from him and quite an emotional trial, so sorry to those sharing beer with me on that last night, lol...) Of everything I've done in my life, I'm most proud of my family. We're all very healthy and happy. As cliche as it may be and incomprehensible to many - it's all that really matters in this short life.
[Will you ever feel too old to play Jeremy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7z5u?context=5)|I do both at the same time... from home ;)  Although I don't consider myself a star of any kind these days.  Just a dude who once did some stuff people dug and hopefully does some more stuff people dig in the future.  The IEM really liked it.  It was a great experience for me personally. I'd never done any real hosting before, so it was very experimental.  On the first day I went with a dry, sarcastic tone and learned a couple things: the lack of energy is not a good hosting technique, and people under a certain age have no idea what dry comedy is and mistake it for 'awkward'.  By day 3 I found a groove and was having so much fun. I really hope I get more opportunities in the future, I can only get better.
 |Nah. If I start getting too too old, we could always cast a 'padawan' and make jeremy the Yoda ;)
[Thanks for all the answers, but you missed the second one about Teh Movie.

 |Real #2. I just recently decided to come back to work 'full time'.  I've been working on a few projects on and off the past couple years, but nothing that required my complete devotion like teh movie.  I guess I just wasn't prepared to stop being a full-time dad.  Recently my son started school and suddenly I felt it was time to go back to taking n00bs to school myself.  I wrote up a proposal and a little over a month later our campaign launched.

(BBS Door Game)...  and seeing as you didn't specify *video* game: Tennis and Chess. I know I've probably forgotten another dozen and will regret later...

It's been a childhood dream of mine. I play Protoss and regret every second of it :) #4: No, although I'm prepared to bust it out in case all else fails.

I think we're in the middle of a transition, I expect most games to move to a F2P or subscription model over the next decade. I haven't played Call of Duty since the fourth instalment and am generally not a fan of the franchise. Also, Bobby Kotick sucks balls.

That motherfucker would be scary. The little horses would be too cute and I wouldn't have the heart to hurt them.

[Why did you decide not to go with Kickstarter for your movie? It is more well known and better in the sense that the charge doesn't happen right away, so I can donate and be able to handle it when the charge goes through.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e83zw?context=5)|Kickstarter requires a US social security number, bank account and resident address, AKA it's only for Americans. As Canadians we didn't have much choice. Indiegogo also takes less fees than Kickstarter, which is a plus.
[Who's idea was it to have those horrible clips of teh masterer and the ninja powers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7x8w?context=5)|It was a mutual decision. We were watching a lot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer at the time (great series, check it out) and decided to have some action-combat fun in our own sandbox. A lot of Pure Pwnage was made that way - us simply wanting to experiment as writers/directors to keep the creative process fun. In hindsight, we know now why TV shows don't suddenly change their formula mid-series...  ;) 
[What are you goals for the Movie with all the extra money you've received on Indiegogo.com? FYI: I'm really psyched about the whole project.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7xbq?context=5)|I really just want to make the best movie we can.  We don't plan on paying ourselves a penny from the money we raise; everything is going into more locations, more and better actors, more opportunities for promotion, etc.
[If I remember correctly...

We spent the money on a trip to Holland to surprise some of our favourite fans. We even shot some of the show there. One of the best experiences of my life.
[Why didn't you just sell some more hair/ball hair to raise the movie money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7y2j?context=5)|In a perfect world...
[Can you comment on the performance of the TV series and what benchmarks the network wanted / expected you to hit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7yfz?context=5)|In terms of 'ratings', the TV show did well for the channel it was on. Much better than, say, the first seasons of Trailer Park Boys (same channel). I think the network might've had higher than usual expectations because of our huge web traffic, when in truth, most people watching TV shows on the web don't watch TV shows on television. I know I hadn't had cable for years prior to getting a TV show.
[What is your opinion of trailer park boys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6egzb3?context=5)|I really enjoyed the first few seasons but it started to lose me after that.  Oddly, the opposite of what their ratings suggest most others thought.

When I moved in with my girlfriend 15 years ago we had a dog named Kemo. Both have since passed away and I'm not sure my heart can take losing another family member, so I'm dogless atm and make do by visiting the local park and being the creepy dog guy.
[Correct me if I am wrong, but Kemo was the dog you used in one episode, right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8997?context=5)|Yes, we immortalized him as 'Dick'. Man I miss that little guy :(

Occasionally I'll get approached or notice someone noticing me (there's a certain look I can now spot a mile away...), but it mostly only happens at or around events with fellow nerds, like comic-cons.
[How do you feel about the feed me song ""headshot""?  Did he have to license the FPS Doug sound clips from you and did you know about the song pre-release?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8qnf?context=5)|They didn't have a license and we had no idea. We found out after the fact through Twitter thanks to fans. It was an honest error on their part, they had no idea about the show and thought the FPS Doug clip was a stand-alone one-time thing whose producer they couldn't find. I've since talked to them and they are super cool dudes and it's all good. I'm happy that people enjoy the tune, although I'm not into dubstep myself. Assuming that's what it is, I know people can get a little crazy sub-dividing techno music genres...

[Hey Jarett! Long time fan, started watching PP back in the days when you guys started out, freaking love it man.   Did you expect the series to be such a big hit when you started?

If you told us then what was to become of Pure Pwnage, I would've thought you were legitimately crazy.  Being a competitive C&amp;C player, I was forced to interact with an uncountable number of douchebags.  They were amazing at playing the game, but completely failed at being decent human beings.  I just wanted their replays.  The original Pure Pwnage was a way for me to vent by taking the piss out of them.  Little did I know...

[Did you ever actually get addicted to WoW?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8eto?context=5)|I was never actually 'addicted' to WoW, although I did play a lot starting on launch day.  I was an Everquest *addict* for a year and a half during university (quad-boxing 10+ hours a day and almost failing out of school as a result), so I was familiar with the genre and its pitfalls.  Honestly, after EQ, WoW just felt like a children's game and I was immune to the addictive elements.  My power guild had moved from EQ to WoW, we were the first ones in Molten Core, I was one of the first priests to 50, blah blah blah, and after I got all the knowledge I needed to write the WoW content in Pure Pwnage I quit and never looked back. (well, except for an ill-fated attempt at a 'Pure Pwnage Guild')
 |I think MMOs are evil, frankly.  I have what can be described as an 'addictive personality type' and it's just not safe for me to play them.  I haven't played any more since WoW and the only game that even tempts me to go back is the upcoming Dragon Quest X, and *only* because I was a huge Dragon Quest fan growing up and it also looks childish enough that I couldn't possibly get addicted.  Always a risk, though...
[Was your power guild by chance the guild Zephyros? We had a similar history, though a lot of our older members from the EQ days have started disappearing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6edx4z?context=5)|Negative.  We played on Rallos Zek.  The best time of my EQ life was when Sullon Zek launched.  Everyone on an equal playing field, mostly carebears from the blue servers giving PvP a shot, and me and my roomies having so much PvP experience...  We just dominated.  Some of the most fun I've ever had actually, often brought to tears from laughing so hard.

[Pure Pwnage (web series\) will forever be one of the closest pieces of gaming culture to my heart, and I'm really excited for the movie.  I had trouble getting into the TV series, partly because of the changes and that I don't have cable or anything:P But I still would like to finish it.  How do you feel about the way people compare the web series and the TV series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e86ih?context=5)|It bums me out a bit, but I totally expected it.  It's impossible to approach the TV show objectively if you've been a big fan of the web series beforehand.  Also, I share many of the criticisms myself, so it's easy reading them.  I do think that the TV show is better than most people give it credit for, though. C'est la vie.
[Which do you feel is your preferred medium: stand up or scripted comedy? Which did you prefer shooting: the web series or the television show? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7yzc?context=5)|I have an insane amount of respect for stand-up comedy and hope to one day get back on stage myself. It's such a pure art-form, just you and a microphone and no second chances. By comparison, scripted comedy is much, much easier, and consequently not quite as rewarding personally (although far more rewarding financially unless you're in the top 0.01% of comics). I preferred the web series because we had the time and atmosphere to just let me go and do my thing, improvising a large portion of the show's dialogue. In TV, you're counting the minutes and have limited takes of each scene, and often times you know you could do better with another take, but you're moving on. It can be a bummer.
[Hey Jarrett! I was wondering if you would ever continue the web series? My friends and I have been waiting to see what would happen with Chris for years now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e87e9?context=5)|I would definitely consider doing something more on the web.  This is something we'll discuss after the movie is complete.  It's a different landscape now though, so a return to the original formula of one piece of ~25 min content every 3-4 months probably won't cut it.
[ off, if there are people in this world capable of making the ultimate Gamer movie i truly believe that You, Geoff and Joel are the ones.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8hvs?context=5)|I've known Geoff since grade 5, or about 10 years old.  I met Joel when I was about 18, in the basement of a mutual friends house, playing 007 on the N64.  I met Dave shortly after I moved to Toronto.  I was living in some shitty student housing (even though I was no longer a student) and he moved into the room across from me.  We hit it off instantly, probably a faster personal connection than I've ever made in my life.

It's a big exaggeration of how I thought others perceived the Canadian accent.  The mannerisms are mostly just improvised, but the spanking was directly influenced by my good friend John during the days of our Big Buck Hunter addiction.

I'm 23 and currently in my 2nd year of masters.
I finished my undergraduate with a Bachelor of Science in Communication Science - mainly marketing, advertising and a bit of economics.

I then moved in Sweden and took a Masters of Science also in Media and Communication Science.

Basically I'd like to work in marketing, but I'm not entirely sure about that.
I've always been interested in technical knowledge, engineering, mainly software engineering but not only. However, for some reason or another, I didn't choose to go to college that way. I somewhat regret that now, but again, not really, because marketing attracts me too.

So now I'm at a stand-still, and I don't really know what to do.
My options are:

Hope to get an internship that eventually leads to a job and then in get a CIM certificate (Chartered Institute of Marketing). Later on, five years or so, I'm planning on taking the GMAT and going to a part-time MBA while working.

On the other hand, I could start a PhD just right out of college. I'm thinking either Business and Management for a PhD - but I don't really think that's a good choice, because I would rather work and then get an MBA instead of that PhD.

I'm rather inclining towards a HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) PhD. That would allow me to tie together my passions for both social sciences and technical sciences. However, I'm not really sure that's a smart career choice. I do want to have a career, but I also love knowledge.

I'm a bit lost. I don't even know what I want to learn, because I want to learn everything, but don't know which would prove to also be a good career path.

It's too late for me to get into astrophysics, and even if it wouldn't, I would have the same problems, wanting to get into what I'm currently doing.

I notice people have either an inclination towards humanities or towards technical. I'm stuck in between the two worlds. I want to combine them. I don't know how to do that.

What do you think?

I can't even help myself. ,ThrowMeAway00000,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10llp9/i_became_a_counselor_to_help_people_i_cant_even/,"Next spring I'm supposed to graduate with my Masters in counseling. I already have a bachelors in psychology and a couple of years of experience as an intern. I'm supposed to know all about mental illness and how to help people, but I can't even help myself. 

Every day I wake up thinking about quitting my internship and dropping out of school. I don't know what would happen after that, I just desperately want to walk away from everything.

I've had major depression since I was 11. I have at least one severe depressive episode a year. They seem to get worse every year now. As a teenager I self harmed and made a few half-assed attempts at suicide, but in my 20's I pulled my life together and decided to help other people. Now I feel like it was all a waste. I don't feel like I can help anyone. I can't even hold my own life together. 

It's weird being a professional and being suicidal at the same time. I have this double dialog in my head where part of me is planning my suicide while the other part of me is clinically assessing the seriousness of the situation. In the back of my head I'm thinking ""If I were my counselor, I would have me committed."" 

The hardest part is that I can't reach out for help. Assuming the help was actually successful, it would ruin my professional career. I would get kicked out of school, lose my internship, and then everything would really fall apart. And I don't want to ask anyone for help when everyone available is a colleague or peer. I don't want anyone to know how crazy I am. "

I'm a relatively successful 25 year old female. I've dabbled with thoughts of suicide/self harm my whole life (overdose when I was 11, cutting at 12, suicide note at 13, in the ER with overdose at 15) with things getting way worse there past few years. But I'm not some brooding, sad person. I've always been a sweet, cheery, happy, loving, caring person- but who cries on the inside and in her room alone at night, tormented by voices in her head. 

My problems really got bad when I went to grad school. In undergrad I was so happy and successful. I devoted my life to trying to make the world a better place, inspire others. And I did. I was constantly organizing volunteering events, fundraisers. I inspired lots of people, not that I am trying to be vain, but it was the truth. I won the top award a student can at my school. As my mom says, 'People there thought you could walk on water"". All that and I graduated with a 3.8 GPA in the hardest major my school had. 

Fast forward to grad school. I moved to a new city, Atlanta. I was in a grueling program with people I really didn't fit in with. I've always been shy, but I just couldn't make friends no matter how hard I tried. And school was so hard. I really struggled just to pass. With all of my school demands, I had no time to pursue those things I once loved and it killed me. When I tried to make a difference again, I failed miserably. I lost my self esteem; my self identity. 
One bright spot of that time was my boyfriend- my first ever. He was so wonderful. He would always make me smile and laugh, believed in me. We had so much fun together. He moved for a job, but we talked for hours every night and saw each other every other weekend. It was magic. 
School got even harder, I would cry in class, had panic attacks. Only get out of bed for class, fall asleep there and then go home and sleep. I had a horrible internship with an abusive woman, and she failed me. Which meant I wouldn't graduate. When I found this out, well, I ended up in the ER thanks to a friend I told my plan to kill myself.

But I got on meds, got a good counselor and things looked up. Now that I was done with school (I had a make-up internship) I could finally move to be with my wonderful boyfriend in Austin, so I thought.

Once I moved to Austin, out relationship began to fall apart. He would make fun of my looks all the time, stopped being the person I fell in love with. He became a mean, cheap, heartless person. But I kept trying and trying so hard to please him, which probably just made it worse. We had no live outside of each other and work pretty much. I got a new job and really struggled. My depression came back bad, I would have trouble doing anything beside staying in bed on the internet. My work was piling up and I got so behind. Suicidal thoughts have been always there throughout my life, but they got to be constant. 

I've spent countless hours researching suicide methods. I chose to buy a gun. Multiple times I went to the store and looked at them. Thankfully I called a hotline, and well, ended up in a psychiatric hospital. That was about a month ago.

While there, I read a great book on depression, got on new meds and came out feeling like a new person. But then it was my 4 year anniversary with my boyfriend. I got feeling so depressed about us, he rejected my gifts I bought him and I threw him out, saying we were broken up.

The breakup was so hard, my progress from being in the hospital all went away. I begged God for help. I told my mom about everything and she flew down on a plane the same day. She came, helped me a lot, cleaned my place. We had a lot of fun together. I felt like I could do this, get over my depression. But it didn't last, when she left I was bad and didnt take my meds and nearly jumped off a highway overpass.

I got back on my meds and am really trying to go out and do things, pamper myself. And it helped. But now I just feel like its all a joke. Those thoughts of suicide just won't go away. I'll never be the person I want to be. I'm only getting older and like is getting worse. My boyfriend said the reason he started treating me so bad was because I gained weight, got dark circles under my eyes and he didn't want to deal with my depression.

Now, I'm just listening to all 126 songs on wikipedia about suicide. I don't want to die, but I just don't feel like my life is going to get better. I'll always have these demons tormenting me. Every time I try, I get brought back down. It's just too hard to fight. I just don't want to fight anymore..."

Okay, so tomorrow a bunch of accounting firms are going to be coming (12 total, including the big 4).

And as a really bad applicant it seems like only thing going for me is this.

I graduate in May 2013, but my last semester is only going to consist of 3 classes ALL of which are independent study so I'll have time to fully pursue an internship, should I put something about this on my resume? Just to be clear: I can intern the same semester that I am to graduate, with absolutely no affect on my internship. 

This is what one of you guys said in response to that, it kinda stuck with me. 

*Make your availability in the spring semester a big point when you talk to recruiters. Maybe not a line on your resume, but a lot of times they leave notes on resumes for the people reviewing them when they bring them back to HR. Emphasize it again during an interview. A lot of firms use their interns as staff during busy season and will love someone who can work almost all the time. It's not the only factor, but it's definitely something they take into consideration when hiring for internships.

If you do a good job, you've got a good chance of getting hired full time and if not, you have great experience to use for the future.*

Now I have already asked a few firms about this when they came to talk during our accounting club meetings this past month. I got mixed responses. Some said I should apply for their spring internship position, while others said apply for the full time.

He has an older Mac laptop and so I'm thinking that the best way to set him would be to create a new Linode with the app running in development mode. Give him sftp access. Check out the code in a new branch. Configure github so he can only push to his branch. Currently I just have a normal Github developer account with our project in a private repo. But this might push me to get an organizational account instead.

He's working remotely (lives out of state). But he's doing this for a class, which is imposing structure. I've met him in person in the past, and we've started weekly Skype meetings. And so I'm mostly focussed on the logistics of enabling him to edit templates and see the results.

During the design phase, we describe in a MS Word document, in detail, all of the code changes that are expected. This is supposed to be done in such a way that ""even a dumb intern can implement it"". The design is supposed to list each class and method being changed. (Note that this is a ""maintenance &amp; enhancements""-type project I'm on, with a 5-year old massive codebase.)

My concerns are:

* It's impossible to foresee all the code changes needed, especially when dealing with the shitty legacy UI code cobbled together by developers who have since been fired; you need to experiment with changes to see what else breaks and needs changing.
* Since there are so many layers &amp; tiers in the app, most of the listed methods are usually boilerplate, and are just plain cumbersome to list in a word doc.
* Any method that's at all complex is easier to describe with code+comments than with words and sentences.
* There will often be typos in class &amp; method names, THAT A COMPILER COULD CATCH.
* Using a word document to describe what I'd like someone else to code seems like shooting ourselves in the foot for ""telephone game""/miscommunication errors.

I've expressed that I'd love to replace the design phase with something like *""Here's a patch I just coded, fill in the TODOs and unit-test that shit""*, since it's faster, easier, and more reliable, but the Almighty Process currently forbids it.
(Also: merely putting high-level guidance in the design is insufficient; I've gotten my wrist slapped for writing a design section like that since an intern had trouble coding it.)

I've been employed for a couple years at the same company since graduation, so I'm not sure what other companies even do for design docs. 

So, what do you do?"

As such, I figured I need not (and want not) stay here forever doing pure stuff while my mind is elsewhere. I'm beginning to look for departments/groups/people working in brain modelling that would be interested in corresponding or maybe even receiving a Maths undergrad for any kind of program or internship.

Does /r/mathpsych know or can point me to anyone interested? I'd be more than happy if you did.

Thanks!"

I still have a year and a half to go.  I really don't know what to do.  I'm doing fine in my classes, but I'm not sure I'll be successful in this career, and even if I am, I won't be making enough money to live comfortably.  
I could really use some advice...
Can a well-meaning introvert make it in this profession?

edit: Thanks for the advice guys.  My placement requires me to go up to clients and initiate conversation in an informal setting.  This is pretty much my biggest fear, even with my peers, or people I find it easier to talk to.  I do some behind the scenes stuff, which I enjoy, but being on the spot in front of a group is scary, especially if I just have to go around and talk to people.  This is probably an easy task for outgoing people but for me, I have panic attacks pretty much weekly before work."

10nwzd,5,2012-09-29,Girlfriend left me after three years after I changed my life to accommodate hers.,FRizKo,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/10nwzd/girlfriend_left_me_after_three_years_after_i/,"We met in Sweden while she was having an summer internship at IKEA world HQ (she's American (22) I'm Swedish (25). 

I lived next door to where she was staying and we spent the entire summer together. That fall I went to visit her in the US. After that it got shaky as we didn't know how to continue our relationship. Skype was a big factor in our lives at this point. I had a current life situation where it was no problem for me with 6 hour time difference. 

Eventually she folded and hooked up with her ex. This was painful as I could see more and more pictures of her on facebook with this guy. Eventually she told me over skype about him and her hooking up. I so wish I left all this at this point.

A few weeks later her ex decided that he didn't really want her and dumped her. She came crying to me. And seeing how I also felt the stress of not knowing any future together I forgave her. 

Shortly after we came up with a plan to be together. She would apply to go to grad school her in Sweden. Grad School was at the time free here. And there are several programs that are purely international. Including one that she was passionate about. Environmental studies. 

She applied but didn't get in. We found out that this was because it was the last year that non EU students would study for free after the government had changed the laws and a record amount of applicants applied. 

Somehow we managed to keep going. We decided she would apply for a resident permit that you can get here in Sweden if you are in love with a swede. That worked and she went over to Sweden to visit me for a week. Next year she got in to the school. Keep in mind I did most of the work. 

We had a vacation in Italy together and shortly after she moved in with me in Sweden to start school. This was august. Everything went on and seeing as she didn't know any Swedish and she was swamped with school work. She never got to hang out with my friends in a meaningful way. (eventually politeness wears down and people start speaking their own language at party's and stuff). 

So I changed everything to accommodate her. To make her happy. 
I started alienating my friends and my family. Eventually she started making friends in Her class. Most of her classmate lived in another city so it was hard for her to attend any social events. It was an 1 hour commute. And when she started sleeping over at her new friends places I was happy about it because she got to have some social things happening to her that wasn't solely based on my sacrifice. 

January she tells me she has lost most of her feeling towards me. I got a real wake up call and start doing the social events at her school with her ( I even bought her a 800$ air ticket for this upcoming summer so me and her could go visit her family shes been missing). 

This being me working 9-11hour days then commuting to her Schools city to be completely exhausted at the end of every night. Eventually I arranged a Sauna party here in my town, I even arranged our apartment to hold over as many as 7 of her classmates to stay over if needed. Everyone invited showed up, but only one took the bait to sleep over. That was what I learned later the guy she spent most nights sleeping over with because he had a foldable couch. The morning after the sauna party everyone decided to take a trip to Copenhagen. I made my GF and this guy breakfast. I made blueberry pancakes. it took me some time since I hadn't tried doing that before. My GF and him left for a trip Copenhagen with the rest of her class, I was invited with but I had more work to do early next day and really needed some rest.

A few weeks go by when I think I started to make her feel more for me. A national holiday was coming up that is a big going out day. I asked time of from work to go with her. I got a denied and ended up working that day. When she got home the day after she tells right away that she slept with him that night. (the guy I made breakfast for)
Well things turned to shit here. It is now 5 months after and I'm still depressed. I started hanging out with my old friends again but it is really strained as how I alienated them before. I have no problems picking up new girls but it leaves me with feeling like someone who is full of shame.
The only just desert she ending up getting was the she lost her resident permit when she left me. She ending up having to pay 26K$ to finish her last school year. (not to mention that she now has to pay full rent and other costs that I covered for here since she was studying and I was working)

I'm not a hundred percent sure why I'm posting this. I just needed someone to read my story. Input would be nice. I'm feeling incredibly depressed about this and need to find a way to get over it all.

10nwgd,2,2012-09-29,"Reddit, help me land my dream job by reviewing my cover letter so I can quickly submit my application!",LaunchRapidFire,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10nwgd/reddit_help_me_land_my_dream_job_by_reviewing_my/,"Here is the link to the description: http://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=ce1dd714ca3b5b09&amp;q=clerical&amp;l=Chicago,+IL&amp;tk=1788a5u7t06ag24g&amp;from=ja&amp;alid=931816749eb30c53&amp;utm_source=jobseeker_emails&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=job_alerts. 

Based on the tone of the job ad and the company website, I decided to take a chance and break out of the nice, but dull, tone that cover letters often acquire. Let me know if you find it a little too risky or if you find even the slightest error (my inner Grammar Nazi can only do so much at 6 am). Here is my cover letter pasted in all of its glory (and yes, it's only one page):

Dear Hiring Manager:

If you are like me, you must take these three steps (in this exact order) when a company such as ByteManages perfectly describes you in their job description for a Data Production Clerk: 

1.	You must squeal with delight in your heart (or brain, depending upon how technical you want to get).
2.	You must research this amazing company and discover how it has proud Data Geeks, a blog, and even a “datavangelist”.
3.	You must resist the urge to modify your resume so that it only talks about your dream to one day copy edit self-published e-books and online content (too many are heavy on ideas and short on editing), the extent to which you Google everything and use Google products, and how you never gave up on your hope of finding a place where a logic puzzle lover would be welcomed because of their hobby.

Once all of those steps have been completed, only then can you proceed to state the following:

•	Between years spent on logic puzzles and your experience as an Auditing Intern, you notice the tiniest details and believe in checking your work thoroughly.
•	Being a bookworm has given you superhuman focusing abilities, turned you into a silent Grammar Nazi (see #3), improved your written communication skills, and made you a great organizer (because once you organize your books, you might as well create an organizational system for the contents of your closet, computer, and refrigerator).
•	Your time as a Customer Service Representative Intern vouches for your verbal communication skills and gave you the chance to occasionally organize your co-workers’ records.
•	Due to your interest in tracking your jogging speed and endurance, you were motivated to learn Excel and became moderately proficient in it.
•	You love the Internet and while you have never considered how other people buy products online, you are interested in a company that has a role in making online shopping better for everyone (including you). 

If I could, I would go on talking forever about how the requirements for a Data Production Clerk are perfectly aligned with my skills and experiences but, in the interest of actually finishing this cover letter, I will stop. Instead, I will conclude by saying that if you are interested in learning more about what I have to offer ByteManagers, please contact me at LaunchRapidFire@gmail.com or (777) 777-777.  

Thank you,

LaunchRapidFire

Edit: I have been sick these past two days so I couldn't immediately respond to your awesome feedback, but thank you so much for responding and I am currently working to revise my cover letter.

10nsyb,1,2012-09-29,Feel a bit crushed.  Trying to pick up the pieces.  Having a hard time starting.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10nsyb/feel_a_bit_crushed_trying_to_pick_up_the_pieces/,"About a month ago, my summer internship ended.  Not a big deal, except they didn't extend me an offer to return.  They haven't told me I won't come back either - they've just told me that I'm in a holding pattern.  Not such a bad thing, right?  At least I have the experience to put on my resume, and a few bucks in my pocket from the work.  Only problem is - the way it works in my field, law, the internship you get after your second year should lead to your job upon graduation.  I was counting on it to be my job after graduation.  It should've been straightforward to secure the offer to return (last year, everyone got an offer to return), but I didn't get one.  And now I'm in this languid purgatory where I'm not sure if I'm fucked or if I'm fine.  If they don't extend me an offer to return, then during the rest of my interviews this year I'm going to be viewed as damaged goods, and it'll be really hard to get a job in private practice.  My resume isn't geared towards public practice.  And if I don't get something decent, I'm wrecked by student loan debt.  

I don't feel like I'm in a hole I can't get out of.  I've gone on crazy runs of productivity before.  If I want to, I'm sure I can do it again.  I'm just having an incredibly difficult time getting started.  Most of my greatest accomplishments were driven by anger, pride, competition, jealousy, and bitterness.  They are incredible motivators.  But when I embrace them as my motivation, I tend to be a dickhead who doesn't really fit into society.  I strongly believe that that is the reason I haven't yet gotten an offer yet - despite being smart enough for the job, despite having good work, I might not get an offer because of crappy social interactions I've had.  I also believe that I will just be a happier person if I stop embracing negative emotions as motivation.  But I am incredibly shitty at using positive emotions as a motivator (I'm not sure at all that I love what I'm doing), and if I don't get rocking and rolling soon I'm going to be in trouble.  

I don't know if anyone has any advice to offer up, but I just wanted to say this somewhere and get it off my chest.  I haven't been open about this with almost any of the people in my life, because it's just depressing as shit to talk about, and I don't want people to treat me with pity.  So it feels good to have somewhere to just say it.  I'm fucking depressed, my life is turning to shit, I think I can pick up the pieces if I hustle, but I don't know how to start hustling without turning into a monumental dick."
10nsxn,1,2012-09-29,Question for mainly the older crowd of reddit: Can you share any inspirational stories about an unanticipated change in your professional or educational career?,HelpInspireMe,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10nsxn/question_for_mainly_the_older_crowd_of_reddit_can/,"I adored film as a career from a very young age, always taking film as my elective class in K12 school. From as young as I can remember, film was always my passion. I never got into a film school and instead took a few general classes in collage only for my education to be interrupted by film related internships. Eventually that internship evolved into a paying job where I was like, fuck school, I'm already moving towards doing what I want to do for the rest of my life. Additionally, everyone I met while working agreed to not get yourself in debt as film school is a complete waste of money, work experience is king, and it's all about who you know, which is what you get from going to film school... meeting a bunch of like minded newbies to build your network, but could also be fulfilled through work experience. So that's what I did... I quit wasting money on school and focused on working... and working... and working... never really moving upwards, and more lateral to other job positions that sometimes could be considered entry level. After 7 years of working on and off, I haven't gotten anywhere, the job market crashed, and all my contacts dried up... so now it's been over a year since I've had a job, which I've spent living with my parents and contemplating my life... and I'm at a crossroad that looks extremely grim in all directions. I'm in my late 20's now and I'm asking myself, do I get back into the game... the game I love so much but suck at and just try harder to build a better network and work up the ladder, or should I give up now, cut my losses, go back to school, study a profession which would be more stable and clear cut as to how to go about living off that career? Everyone says that late 20's isn't even that old and starting over isn't that detrimental at such a young age, but giving up on what is basically my dream, as well as the past decade of my life seems so very wasteful. I just don't know what to do anymore and would like to hear stories of what other people have done with their lives when faced with similar challenges in their past so please share.

Edit: Also, when I started working, I was extremely young and naive. I had a very go-getter attitude and took on almost any job regardless if I thought I was competent for the job. As the years progressed, I became more fickle and started rejecting jobs (not really jobs, more like duties; I always took the jobs but never over extended my abilities) I thought were not rewarding enough for me, whether in monetary value, or experience. This was probably a contributing factor in how I got to where I am now, but it is also the reason why I feel it's so pressing that I make this decision now. It all feels so very much a time that I should be thinking to move forward and never look back... but which forward is the correct forward? I'm just not sure where I should be committed. Should I jump in, or get out of the way?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[So, what WAS your offer for Dwight Howard?  And how pissed were you with David Stern blocking the original Chris Paul trade that would have landed Pau Gasol in Houston?  Of those two moves, which trade would you rather have had go through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esk77?context=5)|We would have been thrilled for either of these moves to go through which should hopefully make sense in the context of my other answers that we want to obtain a top player. I guess this will have to be AMAA as I hope you can understand I would never reveal the private trade conversations we have had with other teams. We thought we made a very good offer in both circumstances and in both circumstances the team decided to do something else.
[I've heard Royce White, a current player of yours, has a major fear of flying. How have you handled this situation, and what will you do in the future when traveling far for away games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjz5?context=5)|Royce White has an issue with anxiety that is more common than people talk about and he has done a good job to bring awareness. It did not affect his ability to fly for games last year and we don't expect it to this year. It certainly did not affect him last year where he was unquestionably one of the top players in the country and the best player on the floor in the Kentucky-Iowa State NCAA tournament game.
[What about the '04 Pistons as a counter example? You could argue Billups and Hamilton, but they would be on the very low end of top 10-20 players. Or Rasheed? Maybe, but that is an example that stands out clearly for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6et6c1?context=5)|Billups and Ben Wallace clearly were playing at an all-star level in my opinion at that time. Also, 4(!) of them made the all-star team either that year or the next. For those wondering on Ben Wallace, they had the #1 defense in the league and Ben Wallace was for sure the primary reason for it. Omer Asik has the potential to play at an all-star level on defense. We will see if he does.
[Are Asik and Lin all-star superstars? or even trade-able assets to acquire one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esws6?context=5)|Lin played at an all-star level last year. Even if he does not maintain that level (likely), both he and Asik increase our flexibility and get us closer to our goals. I also like that Lin has already played for a small yet not insignificant stretch at an all-star level. This increases his odds -- up and down the roster that is the primary thing we are trying to do -- increase our odds of developing or acquiring an all-star level player.
[I am 6ft 10 and only slightly uncoordinated with low mileage on my knees. what is your best offer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6estiu?context=5)|Can I just buy your knees?
[Thanks for doing to AMA. I have many questions, so feel free to skip any question that you are unable to discuss here, but please try to answer any that you can.   Can you tell us anything about psychological characteristics that you use to evaluate players?   Can you give us some insight as to how you choose Kevin McHale as head coach (e.g., any analytics that you can discuss\)? This article gives some hint about your desire to select a good ""leader"", but what about factors such as which lineups to run?   How much influence do you have on playing time and lineup decisions? Coach McHale sometimes puts out interesting lineups. (e.g., K-mart at the 4, or Camby and Dalembert playing 4 and 5 together\). Who comes up with these unique substitution patterns? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl68?context=5)|He is very talented. I think he may still have a productive career. Many factors for it not working but Chandler Parsons emerging was a big one.  there are some analytics you can use to analyze coaching but you primarily want a leader who can help you win games and is aligned with the organization. It is early in Kevin's coaching career but over time I believe people will see how good he is.
 |Coach McHale is in charge of playing time. If he asks for ideas/input then we give suggestions.
[Do you believe that our current roster has playoff potential? Are there any meaningful moves to be made before the start of the season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|We definitely have a chance at the playoffs. It is a stretch goal but it is a realistic goal and would be great for the franchise as it would likely mean  that 1+ of our players have developed into all-star level players.
[How angry does it make you when big market teams (like the Lakers\) constantly have A+ talent falling into their laps with seemingly little effort on their part? What needs to happen for Houston to become a desirable destination for big names?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|Does not make me angry. just part of the landscape of competition.
[Can you dunk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|This is embarrassing to admit but I am 6'4"" and unlike reddit fave Woody Harrelson, I cannot dunk. In my youth I could get a tennis ball through.
[When can we expect Moneyball 2: Moreyball?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|This would be a terrible movie. that said, we did have a 22 game winning streak and apparently a long winning streak is all you need for a movie.
[I had no idea you were into eSports! What do you currently follow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|I am a big fan of MLG and SC2. I like to think I can macro with the best of 'em. Micro skills not as good. I got into it because of my 10-year-old son and I was heavily into gaming when I was younger.
[When Dikembe Mutumbo would speak to you, would you sometimes just nod and say yes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esrc2?context=5)|Yes. And then I would ask him to follow up with a txt of what he wants on one of the 4 cell phones he always carried.
[(this might be too personal, if so, sorry\) It has been reported you have donated quite a bit of money to Mitt Romneys campaign. What are the a few of the reasons you support him over Obama or other candidates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eskrz?context=5)|[I was asked about this recently\] (\[Link to www.tnr.com](http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106489/nba-players-back-obama-one-smart-exec-romney))
 |Sorry reddit, I know my opinion on this will not be popular! Hopefully you can [check out\] (\[Link to www.tnr.com](http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106489/nba-players-back-obama-one-smart-exec-romney) the article (it is short) if you care about politics vs reflexively being negative.
 |One thing left out of the article I told them is that many of Mitt Romney's partners are good friends and owners of the Boston Celtics (where I worked for 4 years) so I do have near first hand knowledge of my opinions in that article and my belief that Mitt would make a great leader for the country.
[How frequent of a visitor are you of /r/nba?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esm6x?context=5)|Yes.
[Would Bill Simmons actually make a good NBA GM?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eso74?context=5)|I think he would make a good GM. He really knows the game. He obviously is a friend so take my opinion for what you will but I have found his knowledge of the game to be very high over the many years we have known each other. The only time I think he would struggle is handling owner input as he is very independent minded (which has made him successful in everything he has done).
[When Lowry was traded away and Dragic signed with the Suns you guys went from two starting quality point guards to none. From an outside perspective it looked like fairly inept managing, what was going on internally during this time. Were you confident you could get Jeremy Lin? Were you rolling the dice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjyl?context=5)|First, I would refer to my #2 answer [here\] (\[Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espxl))  Each move makes sense under this lens. The guaranteed lottery pick we received from Toronto for Lowry is more valuable in acquiring an all-star level player. Dragic wanted a player option (that Phoenix gave him) which greatly harms a players value and will almost always lead us away from [#2\] (\[Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espxl)) A player option essentially guarantees that a team ends up with either a free agent (not valuable) or a player who the league thinks is not valuable and blocks your salary cap flexibility.
 |We were rolling the dice on getting Jeremy Lin but taking smart risks is what we have to do up and down the roster on every move. As only 1 team out of 30 gets to win, you cannot play it safe. A fund manager who beats more than half his peers and beats the S+P 500 is considered pretty good. We have won more games than we lost the past few years (beaten our peers) despite losing our franchise player Yao Ming and it has been appropriately considered disappointing despite the fact that most teams win around one-third of their games after losing their franchise player. We need to keep taking on more smart risk.
[Disregarding stats and from a purely aesthetic point of view, which player plays the game with the most heart and ""beauty""? Who's the most fun to watch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eskxg?context=5)|Scola.
[ off, thanks for taking the time to do this (and on my birthday too!\), I am a huge fan of you and the Rockets. My question is about the rise of analytics in the league. More and more teams are incorporating analytics into their front office, and as one of the pioneers of this in the NBA how do you feel about losing this 'advantage' and what kinds of things do you do to keep analytics moving forward while still holding a edge on the competition? Clearly events like the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference fosters sharing of information, but the nature of sports is to hold on to any advantage you can for as long as possible. How do you reconcile these two aspects of your position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjrb?context=5)|[I wrote an article for HBR on this\] (\[Link to blogs.hbr.org](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/08/success_comes_from_better_data.html))
[If Jeremy Lin asked to sleep on your couch, would you let him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espej?context=5)|Yes. Unfortunately I have to run, thank you for all the questions! I will check in and try to answer a few more when I have time. Best, Daryl.
[I was wondering what your view is on the actual returns to analytics in the NBA. It seems to me that because of the way player movement is regulated and because the league is so superstar driven, analytics can be rendered fairly useless if the only goal of the organization is to win a championship. You can collect an amazing group of undervalued players, but unless you have lucked into a superstar or two, your ceiling is likely a Conference Finals appearance.  Is analytics something that really only becomes valuable once you have found a franchise player (i.e. surrounding him with the right talent to win\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esldy?context=5)|I think analytics can help improve the quality of nearly all decisions to some extent but as you mention the potential efficacy will vary. The utility of analytics on a decision will also vary but I will just discuss efficacy since you brought it up.  Yes, I agree, what I am stating about acquiring an all-star level player every NBA GM in 1965 could have also stated with confidence. It is just a fact that the structure of our sport requires this. No other major professional team sport comes remotely close to having a player like Lebron James who can single handedly shift a team from winning 3 out of 4 games (09-10 Cavs) to 1 out of 4 games (10-11 Cavs).  The reason for this is numerous with two off the top of my head being fewer players on the court and a near asymptotic distribution function of high end talent. One way I describe it is imagine in baseball when Barry Bonds was at the height of his powers he could have kept calling himself to the plate over and over, ignoring the lineup card. This is essentially what the top players in basketball can do each time down the floor -- they can ""call their own number"" and make sure the team gets a great possession each time.  I do think analytics can improve the process to getting a top player but as you state, it has not created a new path to winning like has opened up in baseball with analytics where numerous small smart decisions and great roster management on player 2-25 can lead to a championship. No amount of work and good decisions on our players 2-15 could overcome not having an all-star level player. 
[What do you think of the trend of ""small ball""? There's a handful of teams that have moved their 3's down to the 4 (Durant, Carmelo, LeBron\), and speed and athleticism seem to be favored more so than a big man that can slow the game down and beat a team with his size. Do you think this trend will continue, and is there still a place in the league for the traditional dominant big man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esxec?context=5)|For sure in the regular season, the general rule of thumb to help you win is put your 5 best players on the floor as much as possible. Because of scarcity, the smalls are generally better than the bigs and also more numerous. This is why ""small ball"" works. 
[This is awesome that you're here. In my opinion you are one of the greatest modern basketball minds and the Rockets have always overachieved given their roster/limitations/injuries.  Lot of questions I'd like to ask, but here's one that I thought of on the way to class.  Of all the trades, signings, draft picks, which one has been your favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl5l?context=5)|[private message] your money is in account CYMN271828182846.
[What do you feel has been the biggest hindrance to signing a star to Houston?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjoh?context=5)|Nothing. Houston is a huge asset in helping us in free agency (weather, income tax, large city, etc...). We are not the top destination city in the NBA but we are near the top. The reality is only a extremely small number of the top 10-20 players change each off-season (sometimes zero) and they also rarely change via free agency (vs trade) so the number of chances is extremely small and when those chances come up the number of potential destinations is very numerous. Long way of saying that the odds are stacked against every team and we just have not overcome those long odds. Has nothing to do with Houston.
[Hey Mr. Morey, thanks for the AMA! Actually a rivalrous Spurs fan here, but I've got some questions for you...  I know this one will be difficult to answer, but here it goes. You've stock-piled a lot of awesome, young talent the past few years, but were you disappointed to not get Pau or Dwight this summer?  Are there any other GMs/Owners you look up to, look to for advice, or just admire in the league?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eskxd?context=5)|No shock but I think RC Buford might be the best in the business. Pat Riley has done an amazing job and only league jealousy prevented him from winning GM of the year recently in my opinion (I obviously voted for him).
[ finally, what do you feel has been your best decision as Rockets GM?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eskxd?context=5)|Best decision as GM was likely Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry as it was a hard one to pull off -- we traded our starter in the middle of a playoff race for a Kyle who was barely playing. I think Kyle will do amazing in Toronto.
[Mr. Morey.  1\) Do you give any input to the coaches on minute allocation based on the analyis you do? (ala billy beane\) Do you have any thoughts regarding the folks at The Wages of Wins?  Link: Link to wagesofwins.com.  2\) I own 3 of  your players in a dynasty fantasy basketball league. Can you PLEASE play Asik, Motie, and Chandler more? Thanks.  3\) I've worked in finance my entire career. Is there a transitional role for me into the front office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eslic?context=5)|The Wages of Wins folks have contributed important new ideas to NBA analysis. I expect they will do more in the future. 2) that is up to coach McHale 3) there is but it is very tough to obtain.
[How much will you utilize omer asik in the upcoming season? How do you think he will benefit your team? I love him as a player, i hope he starts every game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esmkr?context=5)|We don't spend $8 million per year on someone we don't plan to help us! He will anchor our defense and we think his offense will improve through his hard work with Kevin McHale and Carroll Dawson.
[Please settle a Twitter argument.  Better nickname for Donatas Motiejunas, ""Donuts"" or ""The Don""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esltr?context=5)|We have settled on DMo just for simplicity.
[What position do you see Terrence Jones and Royce White playing? Both the 3 and the 4?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esogz?context=5)|Terrence can play 3-5. Royce 4-5 although he is like a PG offensively. He is hard to pigeon hole.
[How difficult is it to deal with other GMs who are keen on using advanced metrics to evaluate players? Do you ever get the impression that any of the other GMs are reluctant to work with you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiuh?context=5)|Every team pretty much deals well with every team in the league. It is a small group so relationship are generally very positive all around. No one is reluctant to work with us.
[With the benefit of hindsight, are there any trades you would not have made? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiuh?context=5)|If we knew Yao Ming was never going to really recover from his injury in the Lakers series in 2009 then we could have shifted into our current strategic mode faster and there are many transactions we would not have done.
[Conditional only on information available at the time, who would you have drafted first overall in 2001? What about 1996? 1984? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiuh?context=5)|2001 draft : that was a hard draft to get right, I have empathy for the GMs. I am not sure who we would have taken. I was not in the league at the time so hard for me to answer. 1996 draft: I think we would have taken Iverson. 1984 draft: that is easy. Olajuwon.
[What is your clutchfans user name?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esm8w?context=5)|I don't have one but I do read the site.
[Why did the Rockets decide to let go of Lee for nothing?  A lot of Bulls fans had predicted over the past season that Lee would end up in Chicago in a deal for Asik. Was there any possibility of this happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eswcr?context=5)|We obtained a pick in the 31-35 range for Courtney Lee. This is as valuable or more valuable than a first round pick which directly squares with our [goals\] (\[Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espxl))
[I think you mean more valuable than a late (20-30\) first round pick. Certainly not a lottery pick, correct?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6euhqj?context=5)|Right, 31-35 is arguably as valuable as a late 1st round pick.
[What kind of role do you see Chandler Parsons playing this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esn8b?context=5)|Likely starter and if he improves on his rookie year then he has as real chance to surprise the league. He has the mind and physical tools to be very good.
[Also, as a basketball stat junkie, I would love to go to the MIT Sloan conference. Is the conference open to the public?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esm9z?context=5)|Yes. jump on the mailing list on the [home page\] (\[Link to www.sloansportsconference.com](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/))
[What do you think is the best publicly available defensive metric? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esn3l?context=5)|None really.
[How good is your basketball game?  Could I take you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6etgiu?context=5)|I am pretty decent. I would win but it might be just because I would insist on having control of the venue and rules so it is to my advantage.
[Were you the team to hire Haralabos as a consultant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esmhk?context=5)|No, but he has an incredibly good basketball mind.
[Do you have a favorite memory in your time with the Rockets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esohm?context=5)|22 game winning streak. Tougher to do than win the title. That is what I tell myself when I get depressed at all the work we still have to do to get back to being championship contenders.
[How do you justify a basketball player making more than someone who actually gives a service to the community (surgeon, doctor, an honest cop\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6etg1t?context=5)|Supply and demand has no morality. sort of like evolution.
[If you had to pick a starting five of all retired players in their prime, who would you pick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6essiv?context=5)|I am going to include current players. My five would be CP3, Jordan, Lebron, Duncan, and Olajuwon.
[Where do you rank Hakeem Olajuwon in the greatest centers of all-time conversation?  Why do you rank him in the said position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6etfwt?context=5)|Best center.
[If Mark Cuban and Jeff Van Gundy got in a fight.  Who would win?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6et1dl?context=5)|Jeff. He would [get hold of his leg\] (\[Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoTTCeLhLDA) and take him down.
[Where would you rank Mitch Kupchak as a GM? Were you shocked/surprised when he pulled off the Dwight Howard trade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjqa?context=5)|I was not surprised Mitch pulled this off. Not only is he a great GM, I was in contact with them throughout the process and I knew they were trying to obtain him.
[Who was better in their prime, Tracy McGrady or Kobe Bryant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6et2qj?context=5)|McGrady.

[Hows yao ming in person ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiei?context=5)|A great person which people always say but actually true in this case. I think the quality he has as a person that many don't know about is that he is extremely funny. He was by far the funniest person in the locker room. Most jokes I cannot print there is one time I remember I can talk about. During the pre-season required drug testing, all the players were lined up to pee in a cup and Yao Ming looking to all of them and said, ""why am I the only one not nervous""?
[SEA/OKC was dreadful for three years which allowed them to acquire Durant, Westbrook, and Harden in the Lottery.  How will Houston compete with this by consistently being just ...OK.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl1g?context=5)|Being an extremely crappy team is definitely a well worn path to success in the NBA. Each year, the NBA hands the most valuable asset in the game (a scale wage top 5 pick) and hands it to the most mismanaged teams.
 |We could go with this approach (in fact the Rockets invented it long ago) but we think our approach can succeed as well and can succeed faster even though it is more difficult.

10nlhq,2,2012-09-29,Complicated roommate situation,beytwice,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10nlhq/complicated_roommate_situation/,"I am rooming with a random roommate (met through a school specific classifieds site) who I have known for only a week now.

We hung out a couple times at first and he was pretty easy to talk to since we both like video games and manga/anime. He started referring to me as his ""closest friend"" at school which was kind of weird since we literally only knew each other for three days at that point but I just shrugged it off. 

A couple of days ago, he already started revealing EXTREMELY personal details of his life (ie: how his dad passed away, he was mercilessly bullied at his middle school, he was addicted to online gaming for years, he was in an emotionally abusive relationship and he was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for the last ten years). I got really uncomfortable since it was very unprompted and again, I've known him for less than a week at this point but I have had quite a few experiences dealing with depressed friends and thought that inviting him out to do activities would make him feel better.

I invited him to a party that night and thought it would be a good idea because some of my friends there are really into video games as well and all of them are really nice and friendly. However, he stayed quiet for most of the night and after a few hours, he was alone in the corner and looked really miserable and asked if he could leave.  Apparently he had gone to campus (at like midnight) and just walked around because he was scared he was going to start crying at the party since he felt alone and sad that I wasn't talking to him a lot that night.

I would tell him about different organizations and activities on campus but he always says that they're too much work or that he's not interested. He doesn't do much day to day except go to class, come back to the apartment and try to hang out with his one other friend here but she also seems to be backing away from him since he constantly texts her and asks her to hang out. Whenever I stop by the apartment to drop something off, he seems irritated that I never hang out with him there. I'm really busy this year with an internship, classes, and other extracurriculars and when I DO get free time, I would prefer to hang out with my friends and boyfriend instead of staying cooped up in my apartment.

I am genuinely concerned for his well being as well as my living situation (since coming back to a semi-hostile roommate every day is getting to be a bit tiresome). I really don't know what to do since he seems to reject all of my ideas of joining new organizations or meeting new people and I'm hesitant to become a full-time shoulder to lean on. Moving out or kicking him out is out of the question since housing in my college town is extremely sparse and the options that are left are very expensive."

I don't have any friends, and my family is mostly keeping their distance from me (our schedules don't really line up as they have 3 kids to take care of, and we don't really get along too well anyway). 

I'm lonely. Really lonely. I don't have any friends, and I'm so socially awkward/broke, I don't really see myself making any in the near future anyway. It's a Friday night, and all I have done so far is go to work, come home, eat a dissatisfying meal, and browse Reddit. 

I don't really know how to cure this loneliness. My boyfriend's family has kind of taken me under their wing, as they know of the situation I am in, and have offered to hang out with me in a few days. However, that doesn't mean I feel comfortable bugging them all the time, talking, etc, as they are very busy people who run their own business and have their own lives to take care of. 

It's hard for my boyfriend and I to communicate, as he has just recently arrived there, and we are separated by an awkward timezone difference. I'm worried about him, missing him, and generally just in a down mood lately. :(

Has anyone else ever gone through something similar to this? We plan on getting skype and talking to each other once things calm down for him, but so far, our conversations have been limited to short phone calls. 

I could probably leave my phone in my apartment, go to work, spend most of the day away, and when I come back, there are no messages, no missed calls, nothing. I know that there is a long ways to go until he is home, but I already feel miserable. 

I just needed to get this all out, because, lol, I have no one to talk to otherwise. "
10ne5q,0,2012-09-28,my view on the interns,[deleted],greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/10ne5q/my_view_on_the_interns/,"so ive just recently started watching the show and am currently halfway through season 3. i feel that i need to throw in that im a guy and so my opinions may be mildly biased. but anyways these are my opinions on each character and what they represent. id love to hear some input and other opinions.

george omalley- i love george's character. i love what he represents and his continuous effort to be a good person. in my eyes george represents the struggle between being an honest doctor to their patient and the struggle between doing good for their patient and interfering with their coworkers. the way he speaks up for the patient when a coworker may be in the wrong and the way he supports his friends who are struggling with a patient.

izzie stevens- at first i really liked her character. the way she came from a trailer park and worked her ass off all the way to becoming a surgeon. but as she got tied up with denny she got progressively more annoying. i think that she represents the struggle doctors may have of becoming too attached to their patients. and i think her rash decisions cause more harm than any good that they may create and as of right now she is quite annoying being as stupid as she is.

christina yang- yang is one of my favorite characters. from being the hardworking intern that she is, to the way that she is straight to the point and (generally) thorough in her actions. but the way she represents the blank space between good doctors and worried patients, she has some of the worst bedside manner ive ever seen. and from what i can see her biggest struggle is balancing her work life and her social life. the two are far too interchangeable in the wrong spots (relationship with burke) and entirely absent where needed (speaking to and comforting patients)

alex karev- i dont have much about him, no idea what he represents or stands for. but ive recently started to like him. he just seems like a good guy for the most part

and lastly i have..

meredith grey- i absolutely full heartedly 100% hate meredith grey. i presume she is meant to represent the struggle of working with coworkers or something along those lines. but in the end she is a whore. a stupid, selfish, ignorant, arrogant whore. i cannot find an ounce of good in her. the way she feels entitled to date both derek and fin and then throws a fit when derek gives up and dumps fin (a great guy) because she loves to be hurt by derek. this. girl. sucks.

Something I've learned in life. people will dislike you for stupid reasons, so just ignore them and know that you are doing what is right for you.
[I was once caught smoking pot in a national park and was given a $525 ticket by the Ranger.  Never again.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6er0dc?context=5)|That's the Idea.

Genuinely curious, not trying to start an argument.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6eqm0x?context=5)|I'd probaby ask them if they were alright, and if they were, I'd guide them out quietly. I hate getting people in trouble for that sort of stuff.
[I don't get it, at first you answer that you call the cops on people the smoke weed, and now you say you ""ask them if they're okay, and guide them out quietly."" So which is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6et42c?context=5)|I ask if they're okay only if it is one person by themselves and they seem lost.

[So, I'm curious as to how you handled this. Did you stop the tour and say there is a dead body? Obvously you must have called in, but how did you handle the potentially freaked out tourists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6eszkn?context=5)|I just told the people in the boat that it stalled [i had killed the engine, so it was beleivible.] We called ""200 Protection"" on the radio and tell them that ""we stalled on [canal name] and we need a ride. bring the divers, I think we lost something"" then they callsed back, ""What'd you drop?"" and I said ""The front page of the paper"" [the story was on the front page, they understood. we transferred the tourists to another boat witout them noticing, and they got the rest of their tour, wth another ranger.

Also are you happy with what the chancellor hopes to do to the city?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6epdj5?context=5)|A coupe of yers now. I am very pleased, I hope that the plans go through, and we get a lot of college students come thru just to ""see what it's all about""

[Please explain what interpretive means?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6ep3bh?context=5)|The kind that give talks, lectures, tours... that kind of stuff.

Does my GPS suck or is your park tiny?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6ene9b?context=5)|The park is actually spread out over several miles. lots of the old mill buildings, warehouses, canals, etc are part of the park.  There are lots of places to see and things to do, and we get alot of complaints similar to yours. If you're ever back here, the Visitor's center is on market street, so go there first. 
[What'd you get your degree in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6eozah?context=5)|Working on a music degree right now with a minor in history.

[I think a picture of your uniform with a time stamp would be enough proof.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6eoxo0?context=5)|I'll post a pic of my badge later, after work.
[Have you seen brickleberry? Any thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6eq0fq?context=5)|Yes. it's quite funny. and there is no such thing as 'ranger of the month'.
[You are who I'll be in a couple years. Are you satisfied?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6eocta?context=5)|VERY MUCH! If you like history, it's a great job.

[What are the rules regarding open carrying a weapon in a national park? Do they differ in any states?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6ep2j8?context=5)|Unfortunately, It is by state. since it is federal property, I think it is illegal anyway.

Ever found yourself in a dangerous situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6ep5c6?context=5)|Pretty slow. Give a tour [if there are people booked on it] open&amp;close the visitors center, give talks, work in the gift shop, and stand around waiting for someone to ask me a question.
 |I've never rally been in a dangerous situation, but I have found a dead body in a canal. 
[I've often wondered if it's annoying to go up to rangers and ask them about some old building that they've probably explained thousands of times over the years. Do you find you get the exact same questions from people? Do you enjoy answering them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6eqdsw?context=5)|I really do enjoy answering them. I feel like I get more connected to history every time i talk about it. there atre about 30 questions that every ranger has memorized due to being asked so many times, but most of us [me included] don't mind. it's kind of fun, actually, because sometimes a little kid will ask a question, then 5 minutes later his mom or dad will ask it, and I say, ""ask your son! he can tell you all about it!"" it's quite cute, and i love getting kisds involved in history.

I'm Currently an intern in the Irish medical system (slow, underpaid, bureaucratic), we do a year of 6 months medicine &amp; 6 months surgery before deciding on basic specialist training. Currently on my surgery rotation and don't think it is for me.
I like the idea of sports medicine, mainly in that the patients would tend to be more motivated towards getting better than general medicine/surgery.
Just wondering if ye good people could let me know what the job entails day to day and the different ways to go about getting into it.
I don't think there is a specific programme here in Ireland for it, more so seen as a special interest that is done on the side.
A final question about it, can one make a good living off sports medicine as a speciality outside the US.

Now that I've obtained a job my new goal is to get promoted early. More specifically, become a senior in a year in a half as opposed to two. 

I've seen people's LinkedIn where they say they got promoted to senior early at a Big 4 and it seems they are very technically savvy which improves the efficiency of their work. Also met someone at an AICPA event who got promoted early, she started in January as opposed to fall too. Before the promotion she had her CPA, Master's degree, and had a bunch of internships while in school, including a busy season one. 

I've heard promotions are based off busy seasons and I've already interned during one and since I'm graduating in September
l'll have from September to December to sit around and hopefully complete my CPA. I won't have a master's degree but I'll still have 150 credits and a few minors(I.T., econ, and 1 or 2 more). Have taken a couple computer science/programming classes so I could be good with VBA by the time I start (bringing it back to being technically savvy). I have also had a bunch of internships all at major companies and plan to add one more to the list summer 2013. I also help with recruiting on campus and plan to continue to do so.

We started development for an app as a part of an app+website service.  The money for the app is coming from a university my work has partnered with. They are finalizing all the details and getting the contract ready for me to sign really soon. I already been working for about a month.

I think I am making minimum wage, which is okay for me since I'm just beginning. I love my job but I feel like the work that I'm doing is worth much more than that.

When we go over the contract should I ask for a raise? Also should I be getting a percentage of the business? I feel like the app could be big in the future.

But, I need some advice. Roughly 1 year ago I entered into a warehouse job. They paid fairly well, were flexible with my school schedule, and promised that after a year, they would assist me in getting a sales job within the same company (which paid better both with hourly+commission). 

That year has come to an end. I applied for the sales job and it appears as though my current manager is jerking me around a lot. The manager I needed to talk to works out of several of the different stores and sometimes in the warehouse. When I first applied, my current manager said that the store manager was at a wedding and wouldn't be back for another few days.

Then, he finally returns after about a week and I finally get some information. Apparently, the website which we apply for jobs with in the company printed out my application as entirely blank. My manager says that at this time, they are not looking to hire me into the store based on the results of the personality test and the fact that the manager doesn't know anything about me (qualifications, what my degree is in, etc). And then he said, because the store manager works out of the warehouse sometimes, I had ample opportunity to come talk to him (which is something that I didn't know until 2 days ago). 

Am I getting the royal run around? Should I start filling out applications? Honestly, I'm really depressed about the whole affair. I feel like I have wasted about a year of my life on the promise of a more lucrative job when I could have been working delivering pizzas or something and doing unpaid and relevant internships in my field.

Has anyone ever been pushed around like this? Promised one thing then denied?"

While I don’t like everything posted, I keep in mind a number of different things that help me to enjoy the content I like and ignore what I have little interest in. Additionally, I’ve learned a number of things about this subreddit (many of which apply to the general internet experience) that have helped shape the lens through which I view things here. With all the discussion about MFA’s purpose and how things ought to be, I thought it might be worth imparting a few tips for how to get the most out of your MFA experience.

I feel like this is going to be most helpful for those of you that lurk, maybe posting occasionally, and are generally new to men’s fashion.

* Using RES to make the most of your MFA experience

I’m hoping by this point that you’ve installed [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) to make your life much, much easier. I’m going to skip over the obvious things and go straight to what I’ve found to be most useful here: tagging and the ignore feature. See someone consistently being a jerk or giving bad advice? [Tag them appropriately]( http://imgur.com/a/C8rdJ) or use the [ignore feature]( http://i.imgur.com/19s5d.jpg) to avoid having to hear from them again. I find it to be not just a little entertaining to see them pop up again, generally taking more of their time to complain about something.

*  Who to listen to

Look, let’s face it, there’s a lot of people who are subscribed to MFA, so you’re going to get a lot of different opinions. While it’s nice to have a diverse group, there are a few problems with having so many people able (and very willing) to comment on posted fits: who actually knows what they’re talking about? Everyone should know the old joke- [“On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog""]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog). When anyone could be anything they claim to be, it’s pretty tough to pick through the comments and figure out who you should be listening to, especially if you’re new to fashion. Fortunately, there’s a few things that can be done about this. MFA’s “Consistent Contributors” are redditors that have distinguished themselves by regularly providing consistently good advice and content to MFA. You don’t have to love them or agree with everything they have to say, but do yourself a favor and read their commentary. As you develop a sense for fashion, having a mode of comparison with which you can gauge your observations is very, very helpful. The CC’s are a good lot, I’m sure you’ll see that for yourself. As you lurk more, you’ll be able to pick out the posters who are consistently helpful, polite, and constructive while tagging and/or ignoring those who’d rather antagonize and pick fights. Certain posters’ favorite pastime is complaining about the lack of certain content or the “MFA Uniform/Hivemind.” The best thing you can do for yourself is learn to rationally discern from groupthink and cultivate a sense of style that transcends simple platitudes, but in the mean time it’s important to remember that…

* MFA is not just one dude in a basement somewhere

There are over 147,000 subscribers. If there was some ridiculous conspiracy to produce an army of conformist office drones, believe me, the orchestrators would have gotten bored and moved on to something new already. There are tons and tons of different opinions here, and you’ll do yourself a favor if you learn not to take any one user’s comment as the general opinion of the sub. Honestly, even a number of different users across many threads will fail to give a complete overview. The only way to get a good picture of what people think about here is to read what they have to say in many different threads. Imagine that will take a long time? You’d be correct. There’s no curtain to throw back, no guy pulling levers to expose. Most of the basic advice given here is designed to create a simple baseline of sartorial understanding. If you were like me before you came to MFA and didn’t know that pants came in different fits or that there was any criteria more important for putting together an outfit than how easy it was to do when mostly asleep, you’re going to have to start somewhere. Does it all sort of run together after a little while? Of course, but that’s because there’s just *so many users* that pop up on a daily basis looking to start from square one. There’s a certain economy of scale that has to be considered. And of course, with diversity comes…

* The many different reasons a redditor might be interested in fashion

You could be interested in design. You could want to look more attractive. You could, like me, have just gotten an internship that means 5 days of business casual a week. People develop an interest in men’s fashion for a host of reasons. This is what makes pinning down what “MFA should be” so very difficult. If you want a unique style and you’ve already come to understand the [Principles of Design]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_elements_and_principles), as well as the requisite knowledge of fashion *faux pas*, then you’re already going to be light years ahead of many of your fellow posters, who just  yesterday realized that t-shirts don’t *have* to have witty slogans on them. The complaints about a set of rules that make up a “uniform” and a cookie-cutter-drone-machine aren’t going to mean anything to someone who just needs to know what kind of clothes they can buy to wear to the office when they start next week. But this could easily be the **best** thing about MFA- there’s virtually no barrier to entry. Anyone can post here, and anyone whose opinion should matter to you isn’t going to make fun of you for trying to add new and interesting content. If you’ve lurked enough to get a feel for the place, you should feel free to start discussion about what *you* want to talk about. I will never, ever understand complaints about the lack of “certain” kinds of content. This is the internet. There’s a previously inconceivable amount of information available to you as quickly as you can type. Don’t like what you see here? There’s no lack of other places to look. I believe that MFA’s qualities make it a worthwhile endeavor, but there’s no sense in sticking around to complain about what you’d like to see here when you could just as easily spend your time going somewhere else and see it. If you have an interest in fashion and the knowhow, there’s people here who would love to talk to you, I promise. But if you’re just frustrated with all of the posts about basics, remember…

* This is reddit, and many of us are fashion noobs

Just considering wearing a button-up shirt is going to be pretty radical for many redditors, but many of us are looking to try and step into the adult world for the first time in our lives as we graduate from college and look for first jobs. There’s a learning curve to this stuff. Okay, so a button-up shirt with a button-down collar, khaki chinos, and Clark’s famous Desert Boots don’t make for a thrilling outfit. This isn’t exactly breaking news. But if you’re just starting out and you’ve got a reason to try to look more grown up, such as starting a new job, this stuff is going to be like the first time you ever tried to swim. Let me make a comparison: if you’re just starting out playing guitar, do you really need to be looking at the Les Paul Customs? Trying to play Van Halen? Nope, you’re going to be playing Hot Cross Buns on your Squier for a while. And that’s okay! It doesn’t mean you suck, you’re just a beginner. Now think about how this applies to fashion: am I a soulless drone for trying out a style that works on basically everyone? No, I’m just new to this. Style is cultivated, not dictated, so…

* The point of things isn’t to teach you about what looks good, it’s about *why* things that look good, look good

I don’t think it’s stated explicitly anywhere, so I wanted to do so here. Yes, the basic fashion rules seem dogmatic. So do the baroque rules of voice leading, but do they still get taught in music theory 101? Hell yes. And I’m sure you can guess why: because in order to know how to break the rules, you’ve got to know what the hell the rules are. Why are suit jackets traditionally shaped emphasize broad shoulders and suppress the waist? Because the look is [appealing to the eye]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_elements_and_principles) and subtly makes a man look more muscular and athletic, while potentially deemphasizing a slight gut. Every time you read a rule, you should immediately start to look at people following and breaking that rule and come to a conclusion about why that rule might exist. I can guarantee you that for every example of someone following a rule well, an equally fine example of someone breaking the rule and looking good can be found. But just like parallel octaves, it’s something you need to understand before you can dissent. The trick is to think critically and take in as much information as possible.

Honestly, it just goes on and on. If you want to try something different, you definitely can, and I sincerely hope you will. Try not to take anything on the internet too seriously and you’ll have a much better time. I’m approaching the character limit, so I’ll have to add additional information in the comments. Thanks for reading."

10pd23,12,2012-09-30,My boyfriend (23) is going on a date with another girl in less than 24 hours... how do I (f/24) get over this?,sutetemoiiyo,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10pd23/my_boyfriend_23_is_going_on_a_date_with_another/,"My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship (dated 5 months) and recently we had an argument cause I wasn't convinced he was trying to make a future together (even though he's the one to always bring up marriage and living together). I'm stuck for about 4 more years in grad school, and he's looking for summer internships in business. But I saw him searching around more close to his countryside hometown than the city I live in and was a bit bummed that he wasn't going out of his comfort zone. So I was stupid and suggested maybe we take a break until we actually have evidence of having a future, since he's the only one with flexibility right now.

Anyways, immediately after, he told his best friend, who drunkenly told everyone else, and then the prettiest girl in the program asked my boyfriend on a date in front of everyone and he said yes. He's going on it tomorrow. We talked and feel better about each other and we love each other a lot... I think. I'm actually going down to visit next week and there's a chance we might get back together then.

So how do I get over this date? He's always been a popular guy but for several odd reasons, until now he was picky, and I'm his first girlfriend, first kiss, everything. But maybe I unleashed something cause suddenly it's very easy for him to find someone else, and she's in his circle of friends too. So I'm not too confident against this girl... :-/ At the same time, she's leaving the country in 3 months so he assures me even if something happens with them I don't need to worry.

I have no idea... how should I feel? How do I get over this? And I actually have a date in a couple days (though from okcupid)... I feel like such a hypocrite. But just feel really uneasy and sad... "

I graduated this may and began working my first job in June as an intern then hired on full time in august due to excellent performance. I want to start looking for a better job and have already proven that I am a great engineer here by getting my hands in a lot of different, multi-disciplinary projects, and designing/creating a lot of various new products. Enough to where I think I have a very strong portfolio and resume to get a few interviews at bigger companies through my network (also as another random question, even though I signed an NDA at the place I work, am I allowed to use CAD models I created/worked on in my portfolio that I am showing future employers or no?).

I was just wondering when I start interviewing, what should I tell them the reason for wanting to switch jobs so early on. I dont want them to think that I would flake at the first chance of a better job because honestly I am looking for a stable career I can stay at for at least 5 years, I just expect to be compensated at the fair market value for it and it doesnt look like it is going to happen here so I just want to cut my losses and leave. I don't feel like this would be too professional to bring up at an interview though should the question arise, but I could be wrong?

Thanks for any advice.

10pb5k,33,2012-09-30,The white turd,Axelior,SRSPOC,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSPOC/comments/10pb5k/the_white_turd/,"Hello Ms.

I go to prestigious university on a combination of academic and need-based scholarships. I am a computer science major, and I love programming and computers. I have a girlfriend who I am secretly engaged to and I will make that engagement public next year. Unbeknownst to her I will save up and buy a ring and get down on bended knee, and then tell the world.

i am a large 18 year old Jamaican-American male of very dark complexion. I inherited my build from my father who was a bodybuilder in Jamaica before coming to the U.S. with my mom to build houses and a great home for a family and for me an only son. I nurtured that build with construction work with my father. My mother stopped working to take care of her mother who had Alzheimer's and to teach me advanced subjects while I was in elementary school.

Everyone else in my classes is white and asian. My school (or at least who I see) is 95% white, Asian, and Indian. Growing up in a black community, I was constantly called an oreo, called white. The same people made fun of my dark skin and said I looked like a turd,  and that I disappeared into the night.

Here, I don't get that. I get people using the n-word around me ironically, because they are so far past racism. The validity of my presence in many areas, a hacking club, a research internship I won, is questioned until I am able to demonstrate sufficient intelligence. When I wear a hoody in the winter, people I was laughing with earlier in the dining halls don't recognize me and cross the street to avoid me.

I wear university branded T-shirts and clothing as much as I can so people know I'm one of the good ones, that I'm not scary, and I'm not stupid.

I get complimented so often on how well I speak (I have a pretty neutral, midwestern accent. I never picked up any Jamaican Patois from my parents,  or African-American English from my peers. Looking back, I wonder if this was purposefully done by my subconscious.) It's so good that I'm college. It's so amazing that I'm in such a good one.

My fiancee's mother is constantly trying to set her up with other guys, guys who she thinks is good, all of them white, all of them Slovaks to ""keep the blood strong."" None of them are as 'good' as me according to American Success^TM . I work hard, study hard, I go to a good school, I have a job, I'm also skilled in construction, haven't I done what I'm supposed to? Why am I not good enough yet? We have been dating for three years. They've never let me further in the house than the doorway. Apparently her mother mocks my car, because it is a '96 Toyota. The same car my mother took me to preschool in, I can pick up my girlfriend with now. The sentiment makes my girlfriend and me happy now. But it is not good enough.

I struggle so much with my race and identity. So many mornings I look into the mirror and hate the color of my skin. I wish my parents, the parents that I am so proud of and grateful too and love so much, didn't have such obvious accents that prompted comments on weed and Bob Marley. So many times I wish I could just wake up white. But I won't

Sorry for the wall of text. I just wanted to tell some people my experience in a safe place. Never shared them with others before. My whole environment thanks to my major, interests, and career path, is white and Asian middle to upper-middle class people. None of this means anything to them. Racism is over, we have a black president. Real problem is the huge (tiny) number of black kids in this college thanks to AA. Hopefully they don't think I am one. I didn't check my race on applications, so now I can claim to be free of that ""taint"". I am congratulated for it.

Thanks for listening."

my whole story starts years ago when i was brought to my friends youth group, it was awesome i met a few really cool people and i decided to keep going there. a few years go by and i still attend this youth group. i became really close with who i consider the biggest role model of my whole life, the intern speaker. 

before i was 15 my life was great. me and all my friends were super close and it was great. then i made the stupidest decision of my life i changed schools. i became really anti social not having a familiar face in my school, i even skipped some of my classes which i have never done.

the intern speaker who i looked up to so much was getting married which was amazing news, then he said he got a full time job as a youth speaker... 6 hours away. 

thats when i realized all my friends and everyone i knew was moving forward in their lives and im still me from 2 years before. not even changed, i got in a fistfight with my bestfriend of 12 years cause i need to grow up.

i also saw that all my friends had a girl in there lives and i still had no one.

lets fastforward to now, ive had the best weekend me and my friends went up to the old intern speakers house and we all agree it was the bes tweekend of our lives. then i got home and now everything has hit me at once, everyone is moving forward with their lives and im still 14. everything in m life has changed but me, my dog has died and i still go about my day as if she were still here.

i cant even get my point across to you through words im just confused."

I've been in a LDR for the last 6 months and during the summer I went to work at an internship overseas. For the most part it was a good learning experience but there was one night where we had the night off and I went out with two of the guys to go have fun and see an new country. I had talked with them beforehand and we were only supposed to go out for drinks and then come back after, so I figured no big deal. 

Ended up going out to a bar and they paid for all my drinks since I was the intern. It was a pretty good time and I ended up drinking more than my fair share. (Isn't that how every one of these stories goes) One of the guys I was working with had a lady friend and wanted to spend some alone time with her, which I didn't have a problem with. She had also brought a couple of friends though and he was very adamant that I spend time with one of them. I had told him many times before going out that I had a girlfriend and told him that night that I wasn't interested. He still pushed the idea though and had I been back home I would have just left but I was in another country, didn't know the language, didn't know exactly where I was, and had no form of communication. I figured it would be safer to stay with the group than wander off drunk and alone in the middle of the night. 

We left the bar and went to a hotel, told him again that I didn't want a room but he insisted. I then made one of the stupidest decisions in my life and instead of just saying no, in my drunk logic thought if I went in and gave him some bs story afterwards he would leave me alone. So I went in the room with another girl and told her that I wasn't interested and she was pretty confused by that. But we ended up watching TV for a bit and then she took a shower. I thought I had handled the situation well until she came back out in only a towel. At which point I screwed up royally, she felt me up a little I ended up feeling her up and kissing her once before the guilt and the realization of how much of an idiot I was set in and I left. Never took off my clothes, no sex, none of that but at the end of the day I still cheated and I feel like the biggest scumbag in the world. Got back to my room and pretty much died inside, I had done something I thought I was incapable of doing. 

I talked with the guy the next day told him that I felt like crap and he pretty much told me, ""Good, you're losing your morals and becoming a real man."" For the rest of the time I was there he would occasionally, for lack of a better term, brag about getting the intern to cheat on his girlfriend. Needless to say I never talked or went out with him again. The rest of the guys gave me that, what happens here stays here bs too. But I couldn't change what I had done. At the end of the day, I chose to go out with them, I chose to get way too drunk, I chose to go into that hotel room, and finally I chose to touch another girl.

I wanted to tell my girlfriend immediately but she was going abroad for a semester and the last thing I wanted to do was ruin her trip by letting her know that her boyfriends a cheating scumbag right at the start of it. I haven't seen her since the incident but I know I would have broken down if I had. I'm back at school now and it's a little over a month later, I'm talking with the school therapist but the guilt doesn't go away. I feel like I'm falling apart and I don't know what to do. Although he said he can't make a decision for me the therapist is asking me to hold off on telling. She is such an amazing girl and I love her. She doesn't deserve to live a lie though but I don't want to break her heart while she's on the other side of the world and supposed to be having an amazing time. Yes, I know I should have thought about that at the time. All I ever wanted was to make her happy and be happy with her but now I've selfishly thrown that away. 

I screwed up, it was my fault, my girlfriend did nothing to deserve this, I know I'm a cheating scumbag, a loser and all sorts of other names, if you want to call me them go ahead, it had never crossed my mind that I could screw up this badly. Also, for everyone who hasn't cheated, please learn from my poor decisions, just because you haven't doesn't mean you can't. Don't be an idiot like me and put yourself into situations where you could possibly screw up in the first place. But now I don't know what to do and am asking for help. Has anyone been in this situation or on the receiving end of this situation? How was it handled/what is the best way to handle it? 

**tl;dr I was overseas for an internship when I went out drinking with two guys. One of the guys went out of his way to get me to cheat and I ended up feeling up another girl. Girlfriend is abroad and I currently feel like the worlds biggest scumbag. I don't want to break her heart while she is supposed to be having an amazing time. It's been a month and I haven't told her yet. Therapist is implying no to tell yet. I don't know what to do.**"

10p1cx,10,2012-09-29,Non-stop for 6 months...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/10p1cx/nonstop_for_6_months/,"In may, my Dad's spleen ruptured when he was on a cruise. He almost died, and I spent my entire savings to fly down to Ft.Lauderdale and see him through this tough time. This would be the first time I would see my step mom for 7 years, she has never liked me and has been less than kind. 
----she would call me a fag in front of my friends, belittle me, call me ""short with a big nose that no woman will ever want,"" has fucked up my self esteem, and nearly ruined my relationship with my father. She is a disgusting pig.
This was the most trying week of my life, or so I thought. My Dad would go on to spend months in hospitals. From May until July my Dad was in the hospital.

In July, I was squeezed out of my job, found a new one, was abused at that job, left, found a new job (unpaid internship), found a job to supplement it, interviewed for another job, and took the new job that would ultimately pay more money. As a result, I now have $150 to my name. I had to borrow Money from my parents to pay my bills. 

To top it off, my best friend was killed in Afghanistan in the beginning of August by a IED. 

Think it's over? Not even close...ever heard of Mollescum Contagiosum? Well I have developed that on my genitals, I went to a dermatologist and had an STD test to confirm this, and yes it is mollescum contagiosum, as my STD panel came back 100% clean on everything. 

Now, I am broke, despondent, living paycheck to paycheck, barely making it though school, I have mollescum contagiosum, my friend is dead, (my dad is better, which I am thankful for as our relationship has improved). However, I am sitting on piles of debt, and I just want it to be my time ya know?

Im not stupid, I have a Bachelors Degree, and I am getting additional schooling, I am competent and qualified, yet I cant find a job making more than $10 an hour. 

When is it going to be my time? When will I make money? When will I find a women who loves me and be happy? Why do good people get killed? 

Im so stressed...I just feel like I am going to break down. But I press on, like I always do. "

I just can't take any of this anymore, it's never going to get better.",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10p02w/im_so_tired_i_just_cant_take_any_of_this_anymore/,"I don't know why I'm posting here. Everyone I've talked to about this has said that my reasons for wanting to kill myself are legitimate and that they would understand if I did. I've been sick for 10+ years now. For the first 5 years I had an undiagnosed lung disease which left me bedridden all through high school. When it was finally diagnosed I was tortured by an unsupervised neurological intern for an hour while she botched a spinal tap so horribly that it left me with permanent nerve damage, and fibromyalgia developed as a result of that neurological trauma, and major PTSD from that incident. I was literally screaming and sobbing on the table begging that bitch to stop as she stabbed me over and over in the spine while blood gushed everywhere and I while I was under zero anesthesia. It was the most traumatic and painful experience of my life and as a result I have horrifically violent dreams and night sweats. I can't sleep without a high dose of sleep meds, which I have been taking every night for the last several years. I'm also on narcotics for my pain, and it's becoming a problem. I've been told by pain management specialists and physical therapists that my pain will never get better. I have been classified as ""severely disabled,"" and I am just 23 years old. I have almost daily migraines since that incident. The medication I have to take for that is also very harsh on my stomach, so I have to drink this other shit to coat my stomach to protect the lining because I will otherwise have horrific stomach pain. In the last year I also had an inexplicably swollen gallbladder, and inflamed intestinal lymphnodes which got so big and painful that I had to go to the emergency room a few times. Long term effects of my lung disease include chronic costochondritis, which feels like I'm having a heart attack all the time, and there's also a good chance I will go blind. My vision is already deteriorating. I'm also losing my memory and my ability to focus. Sometimes when I'm driving my vision will shutter for a good 30 seconds and I just have to hope I'm on a road that I know. I hope sometimes that it will just go black so I have an excuse to drive straight into a barrier.

I can't tolerate anti-depressants. I have literally tried everyone on the market and each time after 1-2 doses I have a violent vomiting session lasting for about 12 hours. I felt like I was dying every time that happened, and I hoped that would be the case. I welcome death. I have tried to overdose while on ambien on a few times, especially when I'm drinking with ambien. I always wake up eventually, feeling sick as hell, and disappointed.  

All I want to do is buy a gun, and drive to that doctor's house four states over. I want to shoot her family while she watches. Then I want to get a knife and stab her in the back repeatedly until she dies. Better yet, find some way to torture her like she did to me and leave her alive. While I'm at it, there are a lot of people I wouldn't mind killing. People have been nothing but horrible to me. Every single friend I've ever had has abandoned me because no one actually gives a shit about other people. If you aren't fun 24/7 you're no good to them. I don't even have a supportive family. My parents have told me that I should kill myself. That it'd be great if they didn't have to pay my medical bills anymore. They don't love me. No one does. I can't do this anymore. I am so sick of waking up, unable to move until my painkillers kick in, then forcing myself to go about my day as if I don't want to murder everyone in sight for bitching about their ""problems,"" start to feel sick to my stomach, take more pain killers, start to get a migraine, take migraine meds, get bitched out by some housewife for parking in a disabled spot with my disabled permit because I ""don't look disabled,"" having to hold back tears when my pain flares up even more but I'm out of pain killers, drive to the pharmacist - get there without remembering the drive at all, act pleasant to the pharmacist so they will keep giving me drugs, drive home, sit around with heating pads all over my body, take more pain killers, wait and wait until it's late enough to take ambien, I love ambien, it makes me unconscious. That's the best part of my day."
10oyvn,3,2012-09-29,University career fair advice?,deuteros,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/10oyvn/university_career_fair_advice/,"A little background on myself:

I received my undergrad in Accounting in 2006. It took me about a year and a half to realize that my choice of a career was a huge mistake. The thought of being an accountant for the rest of my life made me miserable. Fortunately in 2009 I got a job that was low stress and flexible enough to allow me to go back to school for a Computer Science degree.

So I've been taking classes since 2009 and now I'm in my last semester before I graduate. I actually wasn't planning on graduating until next spring but I unexpectedly discovered that I could get exempt from the course I was planning to take. 

Anyway I feel totally unprepared. My only coding experience is what I've learned in school. I never did an internship because I'm 31 and I have a wife and two kids and I work full time. My university's career fair is next week and I plan on going but to be honest I really don't know what to expect or how to present myself. When you're an Accounting major everyone is expected to go into public accounting after graduation but there's not really a rigid career progression like that for Computer Science. The only thing I know I want is a job where I can write code. But beyond that I really have no clue.

Any advice? What sort of stuff should I put on my resume?"
