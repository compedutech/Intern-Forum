Its a city job, but its a pretty high-up department in a rather well-known area and I was the one picked to fill the position out of (apparently) a ton of candidates. I'm totally stoked about what I'll be learning from this job, and the experience will be great for future career things, but right now I'm having a difficult time adjusting to the new environment. 

I've got a few projects on the roll already, with great supervisors to lend me aid if I need it. I just rather scared about many things. I'm worried that I'm being a nuisance if I ask people too many things; that I'll totally fuck up the projects I'm assigned to and pretty much wreck these things for the future; that I'll miss something or offend someone and ruin the entire summer because I didn't do what I had to do. 

I knew what the job was going in, I know I'm skilled and knowledgable enough for the position. I apparently rocked the interview too, and I didn't lie about anything I said in that, so *they* obviously knew that they could trust me with this stuff. So why the hell can't I seem to shake the feeling that I'm just *really* not cut out for this job? 

I'm really hoping its just the nerves and new environment, and that in a few weeks I'll feel good about all that I'm doing. "

So, I'm a rising senior here in Nutrition and Dietetics, and this year has been a tad rough. I'm taking this nutritional assessment class, and just took the final today. Thing is, I received some bad news before the test about my dad's job, and was pretty shaken up. I already had gotten little sleep from it being finals week and me freaking out about Macronutrients, and this just sort of made me the most anxious I've ever been. 

And then I completely blanked out on the test. My hands shook, I started to cry, I just couldn't remember. I made guesses and turned the test in and ran out. None of this is really important, but I'm just so frustrated at myself. 

Anyways, I have a deep feeling that I probably made a C in the class (or worse?!) from bombing that final. From what my DPD director stresses, we will NEVER get into an internship with a C in one of our important courses. (Although I know one girl who got an internship last year with a 3.1 GPA, but she said she applied ""smart""?) 

So, should I stay one more semester and retake this class in the spring, hoping to get a better grade? This will put me back in the internship process. Or should I just keep the C (my GPA will still be OK, not wonderful, but can be pulled up a little.)? Or should I just give up my dream of becoming an RD? It's starting to feel that way, I just don't know what to do. "

1diidx,1,2013-05-01,I [24F] ruined my relationship with now-ex [20M] through depression. Need advice.,clichethrow,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1diidx/i_24f_ruined_my_relationship_with_nowex_20m/,"Cross-post for r/relationships. I apologize, but there's a bit of a long story here. Maybe I just need to get it out to feel better about it. Throwaway, because he and a bunch of mutual friends are redditors and I don't want them to see what's going on.

I [24F] met my now-ex [20M] (I'll refer to him as T) in December 2011, and have dated him for about a year and a half. I had just returned to school to finish up my degree after a 3-year hiatus, and had joined the school's car club, which he was a part of. I wasn't aware of his age (18 at the time), because he was so mature and even looked older. His age initially made me shy away, but it quickly became apparent that age wouldn't be an issue between us. The beginning of our relationship was full of cliche's. Pretty much love at first sight. Out of the dozens of long- and short-term relationships I've had, I've honestly never felt this way about anyone.

Our relationship progressed quickly, but at the end of the school year, we acquired internships 700 miles apart. We began a long-distance relationship, which continued to be just as fantastic as being together in person. We saw each other every other weekend, went on trips together on weekends, and overall things were just wonderful. Then, we returned to school and things started to go downhill.

Things began to go wrong for me the day I returned to my college town. I moved into a new apartment with a girl I hadn't seen in years, and it was immediately apparent that it would be a terrible living situation: my car broke down and my computer broke. My field requires a LOT of computer work, most of which can't be done in labs due to open hours and software needed, and I was living 20 minutes from campus. Needless to say, I was stressed.

T returned to school about a week after I did, and immediately offered his nearly-on-campus apartment up to me. I began my last year of school taking 6 classes where we're only supposed to take 3, so I'd be able to graduate this spring. He supported me, cared for me, listened to me when I was so stressed I thought I'd break, and continued to be his amazing self. I know I couldn't have made it through without him.

On top of the stress from the broken car and computer, I was stressed about money and family problems. My savings quickly dwindled, and I wasn't able to replace anything. I had worked full-time in my very well-paying field for 3 years during my educational hiatus, and still had all of the bills associated: car loan payments, insurance, cell phone, credit card (used to pay tuition the year before), rent, gas/electric, internet, etc. My savings quickly dwindled, and soon I had nothing left for food. T completely supported me for 3 months.

I began having issues with my parents as well: my mother is severely bi-polar, and often takes it out on me with every type of abuse possible. She stole what little money I had from an old account that still had her name on it. She was fired from her job, and expects me to take care of her after I graduate. My father, always physically and emotionally distant, finally decided that he hated my mother so much (they went through a horrible divorce when I was 2) that he couldn’t stand even seeing my physical resemblance to her. He hated talking to me, because I never had anything positive to report on. He decided he no longer wanted a relationship with me since I was “done growing up” and wanted to cut the cord.

All of this added together put me in a very dark emotional place. I poured myself into the work for my classes, holding onto the light at the end of the tunnel: graduation. I stopped putting an effort into my relationships, especially with T. I experienced all of the classic signs of depression (except for sleeping - I had to go with only 4 hours of sleep a night for 6 months to just get my school work done). T did everything for me, and I did very little for him. I acknowledged this, and tried harder to do even little things for him to make him happy, but he never appreciated anything. He never tried to understand what I was going through, and instead chastised me for having so many bills and not working.

Around February, after I'd barely passed two quarters of 6 classes with the most difficult course work I’ve ever encountered, things began to turn around for me. I had slowly bought enough parts to build a new computer, and had slowly bought the parts for my car, with the meager scholarship money I was receiving. I was able to become more independent again, but the routine of seeing T all the time stuck with me. I would go out with other friends about once a week, and went back to my own apartment more often. I began to notice that he'd stopped doing anything with anyone else aside from me, so I tried to encourage him to go out on his own with his friends more often. This is where things went bad.

T eventually became cold and closed off. He began accusing me of lying and cheating, saying he needed more and more space, and I no longer saw the man I'd been so in love with. He often claimed I didn’t care about him, and was just using him. Every attempt to discuss the issue was shot down; no matter how I tried to talk to him about things, he'd immediately get defensive, then start attacking me. I went from being a calm, rational, understanding individual, to a highly emotional cry-ball. T would be sweet and caring again one minute, then snapping at me the next for seemingly no reason. I kept trying harder and harder to make T happy, which seemed to only push him away more.

Things finally came to a head a few weeks ago, the day after his birthday. I'd got him a gift that I thought was really thoughtful and appropriate for him, and he didn't like it. I just looked at him, and said ""You want this to be over, don't you."" He agreed. Lots of crying on my part, lots of him saying this had all been a mistake and he never loved me.

I immediately took this break up as a time for self-reflection. I thought about everything that’s happened and changed in the past year, and realized that I’ve been severely depressed. I lost everything he and I loved/respected about myself, and withdrew from everything except my coursework. I’ve spent this time working on turning things around for myself, mainly by working out, eating healthy, and spending time with the friends I’ve been out of touch with this year. My course load has been easier this quarter, and I’m finally set to graduate in two weeks and have a VERY good job lined up in our college town. I’m starting to feel happy again, and realized I went almost 6 months without a moment of true happiness.

For the past few weeks, nothing has really changed between us. We're still having amazing sex, he'll cuddle with me when we sit down to watch a movie, and I drive him everywhere he needs to go as my car is (mostly) fixed now and his is broken. We spend the night together, go out to dinner together, and continue to be active in our mutual hobbies together. I’ve been helping him with his work, as his field is very similar to mine and I know a lot of the programming languages he’s learning. He'll be sweet and friendly one minute, then yelling at me and telling me to leave him alone the next.

I guess the point of all this story is that I want him back. I don’t want him back right now, or like it was for only the last couple months of our relationship. I want him back after I’ve fully regained myself and my independence, which I’m already close to. I want the old him back, who I still see every now and then. I see it when we’re out with mutual friends, or doing the things we love together. I’ve always closely followed this subreddit, and know that people tend to just say “you’re not right together, move on”, but this is different. I’ve never met anyone whose personality and interests so closely align with mine. Whose values and goals are so exactly matched.

My question is, how do I get him to talk about/understand what’s happened? Any attempts to communicate are shot down, with him suddenly shoving me out the door. I don’t want to fight, or argue, or beg; just explain to him that the girl he loved so much took a brief hiatus due to the stress that’s accrued from this year. He “doesn’t believe in depression”, even though I can see signs that he’s experienced it himself this year. I want to start over and go slow. Has anyone experienced this, or have any advice to give? I really need it right about now. Thanks for reading if you made it all the way through this.

TL;DR - Had a completely awesome boyfriend. Got depressed and screwed up. Want him back once I’ve fully corrected this.

I understand that this is a marketing subreddit and not a fashion subreddit, but I was hoping I could get some insight from experience. 

I was just accepted an offer for a summer internship with a sourcing and marketing firm. The office dress code is business casual, so I'm looking to build a basic wardrobe that can get me through a few month's of work until I'm financially able to buy more clothing. At the minimum, how many dress shirts, slacks, and shoes should I be looking to buy? Are brown shoes or black shoes better? Are ties a necessity? Given the nature of this internship, I don't think I'd be expected to dress in a full suit just yet. As a student, money is a bit of a sore subject right now, something they probably understand, but I'd still like to look nice throughout the internship. 
Thanks!"

Some background info: I am basically a web designer/developer/IT/Social Media person. I manage our stable of Wordpress sites and design/code anything new projects, address any tech issues in the office, and handle social media interaction for some of our clients.

I am 1 year out of school with a BA in Graphic Design. WHen I started looking I was expecting the average salary for my position would be around $30,000. Friends were working for about that, nearby jobs listings had $30 marked as salary, I got a couple offers for $35. In researching recently, though, I'm finding that junior workers in similar fields are supposedly making from $35-50.

When first applying to this intern to hire job, I wrote that my ideal salary would be $34,000. But upon doing this research, if the estimates are accurate, I would think I should make more. To make matters more complicated, I later learned that the company does not offer benefits (I am assuming PTO, though).

I really like the company, and I would like to work there, but I do want to make the amount of money I deserve, and I'm just not sure what that is. I don't know what kind offer to expect, and I don't really know what to ask for. If health benefits are around $6,000 of an effective salary, and the median for my position is $40,000, than I should ask for about $46,000 right?

1didiz,1,2013-05-01,Looking for career advice.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1didiz/looking_for_career_advice/,"Throw away account. I’m looking for some career advice. First, let me summarize my job experience:

&gt;Help Desk, one year (CompTIA A+ Certified); Teaching English in Korea for one year, and eight years as an overnight stock clerk. I majored in Asian studies and study in Japan for a year, but didn’t gain any useful skills or couldn’t get any internships during my time in college. I can speak and read Japanese, but not at a level useful enough for translation/interpretation. I’m pretty good at troubleshooting computers and smart phones…although that’s partly me using my intuition and just using the right keywords with Google to come up with solutions to problems. 

Because of some disagreements I had with management, I was let go from my job at a help desk a few months ago. I really disliked the job a lot. I hated being confined to a desk for ten hours a day and gaining thirty pounds over the course of a year (the latter was my fault, and I did lose that weight during these three months unemployed). I’m not sure if I want to go back to that type of environment.
During my time off, I was lucky enough to get cast for a movie and web series that were filming in my area. I have to say, out of everything I’ve done, I’ve had the most enjoyable time doing that. But I’m in Cleveland, not LA…so I know I can’t make that a career…yet.

 
There are two things I’ve tried to do during the past three months: One is I tried programming. It seems like the work environment would be a step above help desk, but honestly I find myself bored trying to study. Same with networking (tried reading some CCENT books and watch some youtube vids…I found myself falling asleep more than learning). I honestly was never one for being curious on how things worked…which is something I found common with most people who thrive in their IT careers. I just know how to analyze problems and come up with a solution (via Google), which why I get hired in the first place. 
 
I’m not sure what I should do now. Worst case scenario, I’ll get another job at a help desk until I can figure out my future…but I’ve been doing that for almost a decade (doing shitty jobs until I figure myself out). I want to figure out what I can do with what skills I have and expand from there. The two things I know about myself from my past work experience: 1. I don’t mind physical work. Enjoy it a lot, actually. 2. I like being challenged with finding solutions to problems. 3. I hate little kids and don’t think I want to do TEFL again. 4. I hate being confined to small spaces with little to no movement. 

Could someone maybe offer some advice on some different careers I could look into? I like to keep an open mind to different suggestions. I’d like to try to get some direction.

I'm confused about some aspects of the application. I got a summer internship that will pay me about $11,000 for the entire summer. Is it okay to put this as yearly income? It seems kinda deceptive because it's not regular income.

Also, how do I account for the monthly rent question? I'll pay $300/month for three months for an apartment near my internship, but dorms cost me $3036 per semester. That makes my housing expenses for this year about $6972, which averages to $581/month. Should I put this down? But part of my college costs (including dorms) are covered by financial aid (pell grants and such), so I don't actually pay that much.

1dicz2,167,2013-05-01,My time at a public elementary school,workaccount45,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1dicz2/my_time_at_a_public_elementary_school/,"I had graduated from college about a year before and was desperately looking for full-time employment.  I should note here I studied marine engineering, not computers/networks (did take a C++ VB class at one point), but I know my way around them pretty well. So like many others who post here, I'm not IT, but savvy enough with google to figure it out.  


In any case, an opportunity popped up for an ""internship"" position at a local elementary school whose district had just gotten a fat load of grant money for tech upgrades across the board.  The goal was to help select and implement hardware improvements across the district.  

My responsibilities included, but were definitely not limited to, researching and selecting age appropriate classroom hardware/software, instructing teachers in use of existing systems and programs (normally on the day that I learned of them and figured out how to make them work myself), troubleshooting minor issues, exchaning bad/faulty/worn hardware, maintaining the local website, etc.  The list goes on and on; I basically did whatever I was asked to do, no matter how innane. I didn't even spend more than 6 months on this job, but I still managed to get a few tales.  

The first is just silly:

So I'm sitting in my closet/office using one of three computers set up for the ""grant team"" working on the website content when suddenly a Wild Educator (WE) appears!

**WE**: ""Mr. Work!  Oh, good, I found you!""  

I was assigned the ESL school in the district, and this teacher had a heavy accent but was intelligible. 

**45**: ""What's up?""   *it was a pretty relaxed atmosphere*

**WE**: ""My screen is just flashing."" He opens and closes his hands rapidly to emphasize this. ""Flashing, and I can't get it to do anything""

**45**: ""Hmm, could be the video card failed...""  It had happened to a machine earlier in the week, so it wasn't outside the realm of possibility.  Some of the machines the teachers used were quite old and not well maintained.    ""Well, lets go take a look,"" I said, fearing the worst.

I sit down at the computer and look at a screen that could be used to induce epileptic siezures.  Wiggling the mouse... it moves just fine.  I notice Word is open and the search/find box is open.  

**45**: ""Has it ever done this before?  Did this just start?""

**WE**: ""No, never.""  He shakes his head earnestly.  

I close the search/find box and it instantly re-opens, screen still flashing, but i noticed something.  I hold down the mouse button down and the flashing stops.  

I look down at the keyboard.  I see the lower edge of the moniter devouring the F5 key.  I remove the keyboard from the gaping maw, flashing stops.  Everything works fine.  

**45**: ""Well that seems to have fixed it, let me know if you need anything else.""     He looks slightly ashamed at this point, and thanks me as I head back by my closet.  

~~                                                                                         ~~

The other story I have for you involves a teacher of particular brilliance.

**TOPB**:  ""Mr Work, I think I have a virus.""

Great, I'm thinking.  The network was pretty secure, so I'm puzzeled as to how she managed this.

I get to the computer and find all desktop icons missing (This teacher normally had her entire desktop filled with icons), startbar missing, default background, and a cursor.  

**45**: ""Can you tell me what happened right before this occured?""

**TOPB**: ""Yeah, I was trying to open an email I got from my friend about herpaderp activity for the kids.   I tried to open it at home but my antivirus wouldn't let me.""

**FACEDESK**^FACEDEsk^FACEdesk^FACedesk^Facedesk^facedesk

**45**: ""Let me get this straight.  Your *antivirus* at home detected a *virus*, and so instead of deleting it, you sent it here to open it?""

I call up the district admin over our school and tell him the situation.  After much facedesking, registry cleaning, and ultimately reimaging, the machine is functional.  

TOPB received some coaching in common sense.  

**TL:DR: THESE PEOPLE TEACH OUR CHILDREN!!!!**

It feels like every professor is out to get you, it feels like you won't have the strength to power through it, I get it, its near damn impossible to succeed. What will I do? Your first exam is a 40, when you've never done below an 80. Everything you saw in orientation was far from what the reality was. You are going through the worst, you think to yourself, there's no way I can actually do this.

That's fucking bullshit. Listen very carefully, the classes you will go through at this place will seem impossible. It will seem as if highschool was a silly joke. They will test your ability to plan ahead, to be organized,  to know when each and every exam is, and to utilize every resource in your power to come even close to succeeding. You will go through a hundred impossible scenarios and still come in far from being able to answer that question on that one exam where the professor could have given less shit about you.

Sure, you can be mad. You can be angry that this place had no sympathy for your skill. You can leave, drop out and change schools, if you don't have the willingness to put in the strength and dedication that it takes to succeed, you will not make it. But if you do, there is nothing in life that will fucking stop you from tackling the future with a tenth of the effort you put in here.

But you think you have it bad? Look around you. Please, do me a favor and have a look at the world. You’re at an institution that will mold you to be the best, and you think you’re suffering? You have no idea what suffering even means. Toughen up because its now or never. Don’t make a decision you’ll regret, when your sheer willpower could push you to bigger and better places. You’ve fucking got this.

Like I said, this place is built to make the best of the fucking best. Georgia Tech students are far more hard-working than any other people I have met in my life. This place has prepared me for anything. I’ve gone through internships and it felt like I was on vacation. This place is like an unforgiving father who wouldn't take no for an answer. Georgia Tech didn't take my shit, it told me to toughen up and actually read every paper, chapter and word the professor sent out. It told me that the half-effort I had put in through highschool simply wouldn’t be enough. You’ve grown up living a lie if you think high school was hard. You need to buckle up and actually figure this shit out. The spoon-fed bullshit is over. This is real life.

Georgia Tech told me that studying would not be enough, that success required that you went above and beyond your strength and put in 110%. It molded me into a stronger, more confident individual that I would have not been had I gone to any other school. I've visited friends at various competing institutions and I have never seen the dedication that I see here. I'll be graduating in three days, and all I can say is thank you.

Thank you all for helping me push through this school when all else was against me. Thank you for helping me keep going. For all of you who are fighting the tough fight, keep on fucking going. This is a difficult institution for a reason. You will learn far more than Physics when you take the class, you will learn discipline. Trust me, keep pushing forward. Don’t let anybody stop you from succeeding. Push away from every single distraction, the end of the road is fucking worth it.

I know that when I look in the eyes of another Georgia Tech graduate, I know what they've been through. We've been through this battle together, and we've fought each and every professor, together. We have defeated the roughest of times, and we have what it takes to succeed. There are very few institutions out there that come even close to this privilege. Don’t take it lightly. However many years you spend here will change your life forever once you’ve graduated.

Thank you all. My undergraduate career has been a phenomenal ride, and I simply would not be here if it wasn’t for each and every one of you out there. Keep pushing strong."

Thank you for looking at this!

I'm a Junior attending a somewhat reputable university pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science.

It's hard. I'm not a savant by any means, but I love what I do, and I want to do this for a living.

It's always been my dream to work in the tech industry.

Being that I'm graduating next year, and that I'm absolutely certain I want to live in California post-graduation, I want to do an internship in the San Francisco area this summer to begin making connections and acclimating to the area.

I started applying to internships as early as February. I haven't given up, but I'm really discouraged. I know I could do really great things if I got the chance, and the advising, but I'm supposed to in a week and I still have nothing.

I have a passion for design, writing, graphics, web development, and working with a bad ass team on really exciting things.

I know I'm naive to expect this would be easy, but I'm lost as to what to do now. I'll continue applying everywhere I can find.

Again, thank you for looking at this. I appreciate that you even read this far :)

Warm regards,

Vaude

EDIT:

I've applied at internships through interhsips.com, internmatch.com, monster.com, indeed.com, craigslist.com, careers.stackoverflow.com, careerbuilder.com, and a few proprietary job boards.

The organization has made it quite clear that there is a significant opportunity for interns to be kept so I want to dress to impress. I tried to go through the side bar guides as much as I could, but I didn't find anything that really helped me.

As I have been told, the dress code is dress slacks, shirt and tie. Jackets are only needed when there are meetings. I currently have one suit (that is relatively new) and it is a dark charcoal color (sorry for no pictures, but I'm not at home at the moment). My suit also came with black dress slacks. So from the suit I have a pair of charcoal and black slacks I can wear to work, and I have another pair of greyish/charcoal slacks that weren't a part of the suit combo. 

Where I need help is fleshing out the wardrobe. Approximately how many pairs of dress slacks should I need? How many different colors? Should I have black, brown, grey, and navy? Are there certain colors I should avoid? 

Also how many different dress shirts should I have? Again, any colors I should absolutely avoid? I currently have 8-10 dress shirts. I would like to expand that number I bit just so I have a wider palette and selection.

Money is going to be tight for a bit, as I'm only working part time and he doesn't start his job for a few weeks.  We will be living together for the duration of the summer.  We're both from the Atlanta area, and will be driving the 17 hours up there.

*If anyone knows of good priced farmer's markets or csa farm shares in the New Hampshire/Massachusetts state line area, let me know!*

**THE BIG QUESTIONS**

1. I'm going to have to bring (cheaper) whatever cooking equipment I need, or buy it up there (more expensive) and haul it back (annoying).  I have access to soup pots, a wok, frying pans, etc that I can borrow from my family.  I do most of my own cooking in a wok.

2. My fiance is a very picky eater, but is getting better.  He has the metabolism of a ADHD bunny on meth, the lucky bastard, so he's skinny while eating all of this.  He likes burgers, sandwiches (meat and cheese), pizza, chicken fingers, hot dogs, grilled cheese, bagels, and general bread.  While some of the meat I don't have control over, if anyone knows of good, cheap ways to make these yourself or if it's easier to get them at a grocery store, you're my favorite person.

3.  How the hell do I put all of this together into a shopping list and meal plan?  I'm 22, and have never shopped for two before.  I'm hoping to make a once or twice a week trip only.  That's the bit that feels most overwhelming.

Thank you so much!  I'll be happy to answer any questions or clarify anything I muddled."

Depression has a nasty habit of making me underestimate myself. Things I said I could never do eventually start to get done. Boundaries are pushed and I just keep going.

I'm just looking for emotional validation. I've stopped talking to my parents about a lot of this stuff. They mean well by telling me I can do it, but that's not the problem. I know I can do it, it's just that it's tremendously difficult to keep going day after day. And they aren't brushing off my depression, but at the same time, as cliche as it gets, they just have trouble grasping how I feel.  

I just got an internship at a data center. It's gonna be good for job experience, but it just feels like an obligation. Maybe I'm expecting too much. During the interview the guy asked me why I wanted to work there. At that moment I realized that I just didn't have any passion for this. And because I'm paranoid as fuck I'm worried he'll see this and fire me, but fuck it. I think the only thing I really enjoy is solving problems, I'm just really good at sitting down and not leaving until I fix something. Despite possibly going into the IT field, I don't fit that tech stereotype where they love computers and technology. I just happen to be good at fixing issues with computers. It's just been a natural talent and I figured I'd foster that talent. 

I don't know anymore. I just feel like I keep doing things because I have to, not because I want to and it bothers me. I'm driven by a survival instinct, but I don't really feel alive. 

If anybody has any similar situations or stories to share I'd appreciate it. It always helps hearing somebody else talk about their experiences.

Wall of text incoming...

Some context: I have one year left to finish my B.S. in EE, and I'll be doing major-related work this summer and I plan on tackling a major project to fill my time and to show some initiative (probably no formal internship, though). I have a pretty good GPA (3.6, probably 3.7 by graduation) and was wondering if it might be in my interest to consider an M.S. for a few reasons:

I like the idea of becoming specialized in my field. I love learning and I like the structure college provides (I struggle learning on my own, though). I think that having a master's degree will make me more attractive for employers, and make up for what I see as a lack of work experience. I'm also in love with the idea of being able to apply to a master's program in a foreign country and live there for a while.

On the other hand, I'm concerned about delaying my entry to the workforce. I'm also not sure if I know enough to be able to do higher level stuff--in my classes, even though I excel at them, there always seems to be broad concepts I'm not getting (it's hard for me to gain intuition), and I feel that that could really come back to haunt me. I'm also terrified about picking a course of study and then having to do a thesis on it--I've done some flirtation with research in my studies, but nothing anywhere approaching that magnitude.

My current plan of action is to apply to both master's programs and jobs I'm interested in, but there will be a certain point where I have to choose one or the other (and also, deciding that an M.S. isn't for me would save me money on application fees).

So, any problems with my approach? What would you do in my situation? Anything else I should consider? Other subreddits I should ask this in? Thanks for reading.

Edit: My college offers master's level classes in the last year of the major for high GPAs (I qualify)--the credits are the same price as undergrad courses. Should I take advantage of this? It would only be for the last semester, two classes at the most, but maybe better than nothing? Or is it worth the trouble trying to transfer over to another school? (I don't want to do any gradschool at my current university!) I wonder if it's harder to transfer to overseas programs..."

Like I'm a retard, and that's just who I am. And I'll never learn and I'll never be good enough for my family, at least not for an extended period of time. Not enough.

All my mom talks about is how good I used to be. When we still lived in Pennsylvania before my dad destroyed my mom's family business and we - me, my mom, my brother, and my sister and dog and all our possessions - were forced to move away from the shame our father brought upon our family to New York. My father was a drunk and never god the jewelry repairs done and even sold some of people's jewelry that they asked to get work done on. My mom was a fool to protect him and she suffered a harmful blow when he blamed her. So we moved away.

When we first moved up to NY, it was a very difficult change. The new house was much smaller and we had to put a lot of our stuff that we didn't have room for into the barn out back used as storage. When spring came around, the snow melted and the water rushed down from the hill right behind the barn and destroyed most of our possessions. The house was bad enough, with the toilet water dripping down from the ceiling whenever we flushed the upstairs toilet, and the water recking of sulfer. It was very hard for all of us after that. 

The public school right up the road was extremely different. I was only 5th grade and I had to go to middle school up here. I still had 2 more years until middle school back in PA. People were assholes and there was one point I was asked if I was gay because there was this kid by himself at a lunch table and looked like he was crying so I came over and tried to comfort him. So, that led to my mom taking me out of there to a new private school 32 miles away that we couldn't get a bus too. So now, with the money being spent on the new private school and gas money to get me there, it's even harder for us.

Meanwhile, my dad decides to get sober for his own health... like he couldn't have done it when we needed him to do it. When he still had the business and we begged him to. No, he decides to go to AA after we ove up here, and even finds a new woman there, which is against one of their rules. One of the biggest rules there is to not get into a relationship with someone at AA... but he always gets his way. So while he's got his new girlfriend, we're still struggling. Child support doesn't even pay completely for the gas that gets me to my school. We're (me and my brother) scheduled to meet with my dad every third weekend of the month, and he would cancel sometimes so he could be with his girlfriend. Or sometimes even, we'd come down and he'd drop us off at my cousin's house so he could go ""work"". Needless to say, I was constantly neglected.

Fast forward 5 years, present day (or year, I should say), life went on... things were still hard as ever. We've moved into a new house, much better even though it's got problems. Now, we can't afford the private school I've so desperately held onto and made friends at and I have to go back to the public school... they're all still assholes, and now that I like ponies, even more people think I'm gay.... Now, my dad's gotten married to that cunt girlfriend that distracted him from us. That same cunt girlfriend who threatened my mom when my sister back down to PA for Thanksgiving and told my sister, ""I can make your mom disappear!"" and attempted to do so by sending a letter to the police in Albany.

But my mom's got a job now, catering for films. Which is great, because I love film and sometimes I help. But it doesn't pay enough, we're still struggling. But it's definitely not as bad as it was in the old house. At least I have a computer and an internship at a computer store. At least I had a Wii and 3DS. At least I was in a school and there was food in the house. At least I still had the brony community and tons of great pony gear and other interests around me to shelter myself with when things got bad.

The beginning of the school year and I'm not doing a god damn thing, no school work being done at all and just goofing off everyday after school to the computer store and play video games. I am praying everyday that I might return to my private school with all my friends and the laid back life and easy grades because all my teachers respected and loved me... 2 quarters later, there's no sign of me going back and I'm failing. I actually quit my ""internship"" at the computer store because I realize my boss is an huge liar and steals money from people, charging a refurbished computer for the full price of a new one. He even did it to me, when I got my MacBook. Which was intended for movie editing, which I did next to nothing on and just played video games instead and reddit.

I was really fucking up my life very slowly, and then it all came crashing down in a split second. I was damaging my entire family's life because of the private school. And when I didn't have what I wanted, I got angry. Two months ago, I took it out, physically, on my own mother, the one who made everything happen for me... I wish I could have been taking it out on my dad. But my mom acted as the punching bag. And I'm ashamed of that everyday... And I'm reminded of that directly from her. And that angers me even more. And you can imagine why! Who would want to take it out on their mother? Who would want to take it out on anybody other than the one who dealt you all the pain and heart ache? I'm reminded from her almost everyday of what I did and keep doing and it doesn't stop.

Everything started falling apart after that. After getting my computer taken away, my connections at my private school were lost, and the video games and... my whole world that I sheltered myself in when things got bad. I had no communication and I lost all my friends. I had no way to relax... and I thought I would get everything back after getting my grades back up, because the computer was a distraction from my school work which kept piling up, but after it didn't happen. That's not all it took to redeem myself. She told me, ""There was no agreement like that."" And I feel like a retard for not understanding that... because my objectives are clear to me but I can't follow through. 

Three weeks ago, my opportunity to get back to my private school was taken away because I didn't do chores. I went upstairs and took my anger out on myself. I ripped up everything My Little Pony related I owned. Everything: posters I bought at bronycon, cards, figurines with autographed boxes, magnets, buttons, t-shirts... I threw it all away.

My 3DS ended up getting chewed up by our new puppy. There was a film camp my mom would've worked to get me too and I got that taken away because I was caught on the computer using her limited internet. Just yesterday, my mom threw the Wii out the window and I went out there I smashed it to pieces. You want to know why? Because she keeps telling me ""I was wasting my life with that *stupid pony shit*."" The only thing that made me happy and I was wasting my life with all ""that *stupid pony shit*.""

And I'm still reminded of it from her... **I don't need to be reminded of it. Because everyday I wake up and see the damage I've done. Me beating her, my 3DS and Wii now gone, my** ***""stupid pony shit""*** **is all GONE. I'm so ashamed of myself and I wasted so much of my life watching everything I owned being destroyed.**

...I guess I was wrong. I didn't have everything, I never did. And I don't feel like killing myself or anything stupid, I just want a way to turn my life around. I've realized my faults and I try to control my anger and try to do everything right but... nothing works.... Nothing I try works anymore. It's too hard for my mom to work around my rage issues because she doesn't have anybody else supporting her. So if she can't work with me, trying to make things better and control my rage, should I even bother? I've got job now and I do all my school work... and now I have nothing to ""distract me"" so I can do my chores. No computer, no video games, no ""*stupid pony shit*."" What the hell else should she expect from me? I'm only 16 and I know I'm going to need to mature but god dammit I DIDN'T HAVE CHILDHOOD BECAUSE OF MY FATHER. **I am mature.** I have people tell me that all the fucking time. SHE even has people because she tells me. But she never says anything like that about me. I can manage when I'm old enough, when I'll have a license and a car. But right now, I can't be the man of the house. I can't control my rage, I can't do it myself... 

What do I do? I still believe in friendship and tolerance, but it's too much for me... I can't do it myself, and I know I'm alone. I can't get friends at this new school, I've tried. Nobody in my life is willing to help me now because of what I've done... but I've realized my actions were hurtful and I'm trying to redeem myself, but so much gets in the way... and now that I don't have anything... what the hell am I fighting for?

**Edit** - I won't be able respond to anything, I don't know when my mom will be back... Until then, I suppose."

I took on an internship in October. They informed me they were growing and had many opportunities for hiring so come graduation they might have a spot for me. I said great! Pay is decent and I might be able to get things for my portfolio. But it hasn't been the best experience.

 It is a startup that has recently started making its changes into becoming a full fledged company and are hiring rapidly and they have moved offices about 2 months ago. Since then I haven't been in the same room with my manager! So I go to the office and sort of sit anywhere and ask whoever I have been introduced to before for work (which includes just two other people).

I have been working there for 6 months now but I still have no idea what the process is. They sort of give me design projects but never any feedback and I never have the opportunity to complete the tasks. They hand it over to an outside designer the days I'm off. One time I spent a whole day designing something but they forgot they paid an outside designer already so my design was thrown out. There isn't one thing I have created yet for my portfolio. I was going to tell my boss my concerns when we were supposed to have a meeting in February but it never happened and she hasn't had time to reschedule. I was in the office on Friday and didn't know my boss wasn't coming in. No one told me she was sick to me directly but luckily I overheard people mention it. My boss herself didn't tell me either! And just today I was scheduled to work from home this morning so I messaged her on gchat but she said she forgot and had no work for me.

I also applied for their first in house designer opening but got a flat out rejection in less than 24 hours on jobvite without anyone contacting me as to why. Two hours later I see them promoting the position on LinkedIn. It kind of hurt my feelings that they did not bother to send me a message why I was rejected. I understand interning doesn't guarantee me a position but some feedback would help as to why so I can improve. Just makes me feel as though they do not believe I was a good intern but I would love the feedback on ways I could improve.

I wrote all of this to say that I need help finding a way to end my internship with them and also find a way to ask them why I wasn't chosen. But I'm not sure of a way to say that politely without them thinking I expected a position. Any tips?"

I'd probably ask a warm-up question about something related to the subject he teaches, and then get straight to the point.

Part of me is just like, ""Why not?"" while the other part still clings to my sense of self-preservation (as in, sparing myself from burning embarrassment). He's still single, according to my informant. I just don't know if this is worth the effort.

I feel fairly confident I'm at a point where I can take those skills into the marketplace but I'm having difficulty convincing employers that because of my lack of a compsci degree or experience in the field.  

Like I said, I mainly know Python although I'm comfortable enough with concepts such as OOP and basic algorithms I feel I could pick up a different language rather quickly.  Essentially, I'm looking for an opportunity and hope somewhere here can point me in the right direction."

I am also employed full-time as a software engineer. I got hired straight out of an internship into full-time work, part-time school.

In a couple weeks when I graduate, I will have a lot more free time, and want to use some of it to learn a new language/framework. I want to learn a new language/framework for the fun of it, but it would be nice if that language/framework can increase my value as a developer.

I have a few web/mobile apps I wan't to build as personal projects using this language as the RESTful backend. (I want to learn REST too).

I am very experienced with Java, however I have not used a lot of mainstream frameworks. I know how to use servlets, JSP scriptlets, JSF, Tomcat, and an unheard-of web service framework that my company uses. I also am pretty familiar with Groovy because Groovy is used in said web service framework.

I know basic javascript and jQuery, but I am definitely no expert. 

I have played around with Ruby and done a few homework assignments in the language and was very, very pleased with it. 

I know lots of C and little C++

I know a little Python, Perl, PHP, and Scheme from various school projects.

I am interested in exploring Spring, Play!, Scala, Lift, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, node.js, clojure, or dart. 


Basically I read /r/programming and all of the blogs, but never have enough time to actually learn one of these things.

What technologies actually have employment incentives? What technologies are just fun to learn?

Taking that job was the biggest mistake of my life. I hate computers, and once you've been labeled a computer guy, your life is over outside of the industry. 

I scrimped and saved and lived like I was poor so that I could get out of computers. I planned, and waited. I set up a (non-paying, of course) internship in an industry I like, and quit. I got out. It was glorious. I spent a year at the internship, and when that was up I went looking for jobs where there were none. At least for me.

I took classes and submitted resumes. I did gratis and freelance work to pump up my resume. I took more classes in related fields. I watched the other people I interned with get hired and do well while no one would take a chance on me. 

After 4 years of that, my money ran out and I started looking for anything I could get. I couldn't get clerical jobs in the industry. I couldn't get coffee shop jobs to keep me afloat. I couldn't get any kind of job whatsoever. I did manage to get one job that really wasn't too horrible, and the owner of the company paid me in bounced checks and moved to Africa.

So I tried to kill myself. I was locked in a hospital for over a week and sent an embarrassingly large bill for it. The state refused to cover me for reasons I never really figured out; I just got stuck with the bill.

So now I'm back in computers. Because, apparently, hard work and dedication are worthless. Skill is worthless. Talent is worthless. All that matters is where society decides you should work. You're done doing anything else. And just to rub salt in the wound, since I'd been out of the computer industry for nearly 5 years I'm now getting paid shit. At the end of the month, I have $20 left over.

This is not a life worth living."

Well since then, I've changed. I've gone through a bout of serious depression, went on an adventure, and am back to normal for me pretty much.

Since the last FR I posted I've had almost complete apathy towards school work which lowered my GPA a bit. Not even the fact that I got a good internship for the summer was enough motivation to try harder. I went on an amazing family vacation to South America for two and half weeks, I was happy but when I came to my college town I went back to depression.

What did help me was a solo trip on the Appalachian trail about a month ago. I tried hitchhiking, I walked for 20 miles with a 35 pound pack on my back and had a lot of time to think about life and the big picture and everything else. That was the thing that motivated me to concentrate back on school work.

Since then I go out to have fun. I don't go to frat parties or clubs since they're not my thing but I do go to a lot of house parties and concerts. I've made a bunch more friends with my coworkers at my job on campus. That and through other friends I know have two more social circles to bounce around in during the weekends. 

Last weekend I was at a house party celebrating a friend's birthday. At first none of the girls there caught my eye, so I just talked to the guys in the house and made friends with them. As the night progressed, a HB6.5 says ""hey I dont know you"". Huge IoI right there. Since I was very buzzed and didn't care what would happen with this girl I just introduced myself, hugged her, and kept my arm around her lower back. Three minutes later of drunk conversation later we were making out. Got her number.

Today we went out for lunch, and well, she was still HB6.5 but I didn't feel any romance and spark so I'm not going to pursue.
Today on the bus back home I noticed HB8.5 get on the bus. OMG. This is the same one that I've been seeing for like two months, we've shared glances, she went on the bus I was driving and said hi and bye. And I pussied out before by not introducing myself. But this time, I just got up and went straight there. Now I have a date for Friday night.

**Main Points**

- Get your own mental and physical state in order before gaming

- Have fun and all good things will come after

- Have at least three social circles to bounce around in on the weekends

- Having fun will teach you outcome independence

- If you need to get a job on campus, get a job that everybody sees you doing, but the job is interesting (huge confidence boost at every party that people have recognized me as a bus driver and they came up to me and wanted to talk with me - otherwise known as DHV)

- Act quickly. If I had thought about HB8.5 I would not even have gotten up to talk with her. 3 second rule is golden rule. Does not give you enough time to talk yourself out of shit."

I've worked here for a year and the opportunity to apply for Supervisor came up, so I applied and I think there's a pretty decent chance I could get it.

I've got an interview, but I'm having second thoughts on whether I want to go through with it, for a few reasons. Obviously this is just a retail job, so it's not somewhere I want to be forever. I do enjoy it here though.

Reasons for:

- Better pay (£6.85 instead of £5.48)
- Looks good on CV for future

Reasons against:

- I don't think I'd enjoy it as much, I won't be working as much with the group of 35 other staff members who I'm good friends with
- I don't want to be here forever. I want to look at something in Law, and do an internship or something but continue working here for money reasons. And I don't think I'd have the freedom to do that as a supervisor.

So really, my question is, do you think the extra £1.27 an hour and having 'Supervisor' on my CV (resume) for the future is worth it, for a job I won't enjoy as much and may possibly limit other career options. Because I'm really stuck here. I don't know which route to go."

I am a junior at a University now with a 3.5 Gpa. I recently had a 1/4 life crisis and decided that I am meant to go to medical school. I am a kinesiology major and have only shadowed a doctor twice since my mind was made up a few weeks ago. I am in a fraternity and hold a leadership position. I was training for the Navy SF all college and high school but recent events have steered me toward helping people through medicine. 

I did a summer program shadowing 10 different doctors over a two week span in high school and also went on a mission trip to a monastic community in Arkansas. I have signed up for the MCAT in late June and also I am taking a Princeton Review class before hand. 

Here is the kicker. I am currently on deferred suspension(should be suspended but there were mitigating circumstances) until I graduate so its basically that I am on probation until then. What got me in trouble was not academic but it involved my fraternity. It will come off my record when I graduate next spring but it is there until then. I plan on volunteering and shadowing all summer and next fall and applying in and around september. I also have an internship all fall with a class I got into that sets me up with doctors.

Okay my story isn't a massive mess like some of the horror stories from some Drexel students, but I don't want to fall flat on my face in another ugly mess.

I applied for University of Nebraska and took 2 years of Computer Engineering and received an out-of-state scholarship that required me to maintain a 3.0 GPA and I received it despite having a 24/36 ACT score. Yeah here comes the part that sucks: After two years and a 3.8 GPA in Computer Engineering later, I have to transfer to the bigger University (relatives are trading me around, basically). I walk in there and they drop my scholarship from both schools because all of a sudden that ACT score matters now and apparently I couldn't retake the ACT to acquire the scholarship a second time.

Yup. I'm a victim of shitty standardized tests despite having a fantastic performance record under a program overseeing students in a high-demand, hard-working field. I don't understand it, either. The saddest song in the world stopped playing last year. I've been poutin' it like a manbaby at Wal-Mart as a cashier and I've had enough of that, I wanna make a man outta myself, already.

OK so girlfriend lives in Pennsylvania and is willing to room with me, and I'm sitting here in Texas with my folks. There are two possibilities, both include having to live on my own. I could go to a university in Texas and support myself entirely (+ roommates) or I could hoof it to PA and numbercrunch some logistics until my girl and I are confident with living together. One sounds better, and she urges me to go to Drexel but hold up I see those horror stories about the hundreds of thousands in debt fuck that shit with a full ten foot volleyball net pole bye

A good number of my basics are complete + a couple of engineering courses and lab experience is under the belt. I like the idea of moving to PA. Got about $1000 in personal savings atm, so this is a months-in-advance kind of scheme. This is a plan, mind, so I'm gonna be saving up a bit more, tell my friend I'm not buying shit anymore, I'm a poor ass sucker, etc.

First of all, I need another good TX/PA school that won't rip me to shreds with debt, if not help maintain a sensible total accrued. I am not gonna get a decent computer job with the low level of experience I have, and I have memorized those fucking tomato codes so damn much (I HATE the tomatoes) I barely remember how to code in Java. I'm gonna start researching internships and companies based around the areas, plus start snatching up scholarships.

I'm self-employed, too, music production, so taxes can be kinda rough on me. I'll be looking through other threads to figure out how I'm gonna get used to living poor and not spending everything I own like a dummy. Anything else I should be sticking my nose in?"

This summer will be the first summer I'll be doing an internship. After college I want to go into either public service, governmental relations, and then maybe law school shortly after. 

I'll be interning at a law office doing paralegal work for a family friend one or two days a week, but other than that, I got an offer to work at the Democratic Party headquarters in my state. But, I got an interview Monday at a Republican Party County office pretty much down the street from my house. 

I'm registered as an Republican but I have shared values from both parties. The offer for the Democratic internship is there but I think I would rather work for the Republican party office. 

Over the summer, my fraternity at my university is going to pair me up with a mentor and I asked specifically by name to be paired up with this Brother who is a Republican who is Congressman for the district that I live fairly close to and whom I've met several times. 

If I accept the Democratic internship and then maybe somewhere down the road I end up working with the Congressman would that look bad on my part about my past experience?

I'm a CS undergraduate in Scotland. Just about finished my second year with averages of around 80%, was on the deans list last year.

At the minute I'm doing little bits of freelance web development work for people I know, and finding some work online.

However, as for looking for a proper job for the 5 months of summer I'm finding it impossible. I don't want to travel far which makes it more difficult.

For fixed term developer work (mainly web), most require a degree or a certain number of years experience in certain technologies. Companies don't seem to understand that you someone can do work to a high level without these things.

As for internships, pretty much all companies seem to be looking for students in between 3rd and 4th year, and ignore students before this stage. The university offered work for 2nd year students and then took it back and made it only for 3rd year.

I need some help in how to network for technical jobs, and how to get work without a degree. Tips on getting more and better freelance work would also be helpful.

I've been out of school for almost a year now and I haven't been able to land too many interviews. I've had my resume critiqued by my professor, engineering professionals, as well as friends. I guess it's time to see what Reddit has to say. 

As of today I've submitted 170 applications to various engineering companies and organizations throughout my state. I've had a total of 3 interviews. Company A was a one and done interview, Company B had me come back for a second interview but I didn't get the job, and finally the interview with Company C was straight up bad. I've also tried to apply to as many internships as I can but a lot of companies want students.

In regards to my resume:

* I had a crappy GPA (&lt; 3.0) so that's why it's not listed.
*  I didn't have any jobs/internships/research/volunteer work while I was in school (yes I'm kicking myself for not getting an internship; I had to take summer school practically every summer)

It started off with depression due to an oppressive supervisor during my time as a Resident Adviser, who saw fit to scream and berate me at all hours in my room. I had never had problems with job performance before that, and this was the first person aside from the bullies back in middle school who made a dedicated effort to destroying my self-worth. I ended up taking a few semesters off here and there, but [I couldn't regain the drive I had previously.](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rn2s8/the_transformation_into_a_bitter_old_man_is/) I did manage to land a few internships along the way, but now I'm sitting as a sixth year senior with a horrid GPA due to medical problems. No one is going to hire me, and I need the medical insurance desperately before I lose coverage under my parents.

Back in 2010, I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. It was mild, and didn't really affect my life all too much. However, my doctor at the time was hugely unhelpful and refused to give me proper treatment numerous times. Until a couple months ago, I simply dealt with the symptoms on my own, as OTC medication aided with the pain, frequency, and other stuff. But, low and behold, I got worse. Worse to the point where not two weeks ago I had to run out of an exam in shit-stained jeans. Worse to the point where I ended up in the ER twice for the sheer amount of pain I was in. I couldn't (and still can't) sleep, couldn't eat much, and 90% of my time was/is spent in the bathroom doubled over trying not to cry. Luckily, I was able to finally get a colonoscopy/endoscopy done Monday, but it's just made things worse. 

My condition is now ""borderline severe,"" and I have to start taking the equivalent of chemo medication in addition to various steroids and pain killers. What's worse is I can't take any OTC pain stuff anymore, else I run the risk of even more painful ulcers developing. I'm not quite at the point where I need narcotics yet, but I can already feel my body building resistance to the new medication. I don't want to live in pain constantly, and I don't want to become drug addict, but it's slowly becoming clear that that might be my only options.

My social life doesn't exist anymore, except for one friend who has been kind enough to run errands for me and make sure I'm alright every day. Except, I can't keep relying on him, he's a grad student with his own problems to deal with. I don't really like my parents, especially since they made growing up a very unpleasant and over-sheltered experience. There's not much I find enjoyment in these days aside from playing D&amp;D on Mondays, but that's only because I can temporarily escape this living hell and live vicariously through my character. I can't go out much due to being chained to the nearest toliet, not like anyone would care for company anyways.

I had nowhere else to go. Unfortunately, my grandmother and a close friend cosigned for these loans, and I need/want their names off as soon as possible. My school's financial aid office misrepresented many things to me; the difficulty of removing a cosigner was among them. 

I know; I know. Another (soon-to-be) unemployed English major who should have chose STEM or business.

I've won awards for my writing, and my grades are fairly solid. (3.81, as of this post.) I have a great deal of work experience. Of this, most notable is my two year internship at the world's biggest research institution, where I did technical and grant writing. I actually wrote the training guide used to instruct new researchers on a massive project. For the past year, I've worked for my university in one of their offices and as a research assistant for one of my professors. 

I'm at a crossroads. I want to take the exams to get my certification to teach as something to fall back on (I should have done this sooner), and I've been applying for technical writing jobs. Unfortunately, the sequester has hit my area hard. My mother's a professional tech writer who encouraged me towards the field, and even she admits that it's pretty barren these days. 

I've been applying for jobs left and right, and I've received few responses except for a few who seemed to lose interest once they learn I'm not graduating for a few more weeks. Public schools in my area won't look at me without my certification; I haven't even seen any paraprofessional jobs open up. Private schools are pretty promising, and I have a few leads but they won't know anything certain until the end of the school year. My internship isn't hiring. Again, budget cuts. 

Things have gotten better lately, so I shouldn't feel so stressed. My grades are fine. I've lost thirty pounds since January, and I plan to only intensify my weight loss journey once school is done. I've found an affordable room to rent upon graduation with people I care about. I've stayed with them in the past, and I know the rhythms of their household. I most likely have a part-time job I can start in a few weeks if I choose. I should be getting my license within the next week or two. (I failed on Tuesday based on my back wheel being two inches too far from the curb while parallel parking. Sigh.) 

Things are looking up, and I know the job market is tough with thousands of applicants graduating from college this May. Still, I really want stability. 

This morning, I woke up thinking about joining the armed forces, especially the Air Force. Health insurance, room and board, and steady income is a huge draw for me. With a degree, I can become an officer; I know the training/candidate schools are selective when it comes to college degrees, but I don't know how selective they are. I need to lose more weight, but I'm confident that I can continue to make progress on that front. Before I started college, I know I could meet the requirements for women easily; I just need to get back to that point.

My Sallie Mae loans are gathering massive amounts of interest, sending out job applications is making me feel worthless, and I don't really know what to do.

Do you have any advice? Or: ask me about my time as a semi-homeless college student! "

I’ve just been trying to use every position to learning as much as I can.
After nearly a year of this (I started internships my last semester of college) I feel like I'm doing all the work, and not getting paid for it. I talk every day about ways to get out of this rut. My mind is obsessed with it. --it has caused me to be semi-depressed for the last 6 months. It's hard to pick a choice and just stick with it--whether starting my own company/blog/brewery or moving to Australia and working for the mining industry. 
At this point, I've seen the 'corporate' lifestyle. I don't know if I even want to work a 9-5, or if it's just because I don't really enjoy what I'm doing.  I’m still young. I know I still want to travel, but that requires enough money to not just be paying rent and searching for jobs all the time. I need to get ahead.

The few things I am sure of:
1) I want to get paid well. Not $70-90,000 well, but $40-60,00--I don't think it's too much to ask. I'm worth it.
2) I know I can do the work of my 'managers'. Most don't even know how to use excel/ppt./outlook.
3) I love the outdoors/beer/traveling/food, but who the hell doesn't? How do I break into these industries?
4) I don’t want to get stuck doing something I don’t enjoy/I don’t want to be ‘mediocre’ in my lifestyle. I’m willing to do whatever it takes to become the best in an industry—how do I get the opportunity?

This would on top of inventorying Greenhouse Gases and taking care of a lot of paperwork.

As it turns out, the position is entirely paperwork and data management in Microsoft Excel, and I can't say I've done a single thing that is truly Chemical Engineering. At the same time, it appears as though there isn't much work in that field within the company, and my College has said there isn't much else that can be done in this situation.

If anybody has been in a similar situation, how did you improve upon it?"
1dkira,2,2013-05-02,Graduate Students of LU or to those planning and already have taken the GRE,[deleted],LamarUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/LamarUniversity/comments/1dkira/graduate_students_of_lu_or_to_those_planning_and/,"Hello guys,
   I am thinking about applying to LU for graduate school - specifically, the ME department to get my masters in engr. Now from what I've seen on the website, it looks as if they utilize the following as a baseline for admission: 

* (GPA or last 60sem hours, whichever is higher)*50 + newGRE_Vscore + newGRE_Qscore &gt;= 428.

or, with the old GRE:

* (GPA or last 60sem hours, whichever is higher)*200 + oldGRE_Vscore + oldGRE_Qscore &gt;= 1350.


My question is, what were your GRE scores and undergrad GPA? You can just list a scale if you don't want to post your actual scores, that's fine. Additionally, if you had academic extracurriculars, research, or internships, what were they? I'm trying to gather a general picture of the graduate admission standards at LU, so as to know where I stand. Thanks."
1dki1o,46,2013-05-02,International Teaching: How to do it and why it is amazing.,MonmouthAldrich,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1dki1o/international_teaching_how_to_do_it_and_why_it_is/,"Hi Reddit. This is my first post and probably my last, but I wanted to give educators who love to teach but have been screwed over by the educational system in the United States an opportunity to do what they love.

Here is some background on my story. I graduated with a degree in History Education in December of 2009. I had a 3.97 GPA, was the president of the History Honors Society, presented professional papers at historical conferences and had teaching internships on Lakota Indian Reservations, England, Scotland, North Ireland and Greece. I did everything I could in college to make myself marketable because I knew finding a teaching job for history (or most other subjects besides math) would be very difficult. Unfortunately, it was not enough. For two years I jumped around school coming in mid-year to cover a teacher for a few months and never considered for a full time teaching position. The first time was because of budget cuts, the second was due to nepotism and the third was because I could not compete with much more experienced teachers who wanted to same jobs I did. I was frustrated and angry that I could not do what I loved to do without constantly being fearful of where or how long I would be working. I explained my frustrations to a friend at the gym who told me about International Teaching. Honestly I had never heard of it, but took her advice and was offered a job in Costa Rica. It was the best decision of my life. 

I wanted to let teachers who have been struggling to find jobs that there are schools that will give you the opportunity to do what you love, and will give you a much better package than schools in the United States. First, here are a few of the larger companies that serve as a third party between teachers and International Schools:

1) [Search Associates](http://www.searchassociates.com) -This is the company I would recommend. You have your own recruiter for your area and they try very hard to help you find a position. However the cost to join is about $250, but in my opinion it is well worth it. The $250 also covers the cost for a job-fair.

2) [COIS](http://www.cois.org/) -This is a free company that is well known and has job fairs all over the world, but is a bit more like a meat-market
*There are a few more, but these are by far the best in my opinion*

So, here is how you get into International Teaching:

1) Sign up with one of the third party companies above. This may take a few days, depending on what they need you to provide (recommendations etc.).

2) Sign up for a teaching fair. These will be from the months of January to June and will be all over the world. For example, Search-Associates have fair in London, Toronto, Bangkok, Hong Kong, South Africa and Maryland to name a few. The schools that will be attending will be listed on the site. The fairs last for 3 days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday). Book your plane ticket and hotel reservation (preferable the same hotel the job-fair will be at).

AND/OR

Look at the school the company has connections with. Pick a country or region of the world you want to go to and email the school of your intentions (regardless if they have vacancies or not). This will allow you to network and may get you an interview for a position even if no vacancies are posted (I was offered a job in Kuwait through this method).

3) Go to the fair. While going to the teaching fair make sure you have numerous copies of your resume, sample lesson plans and a list of your top schools. Make sure you are dressed very professionally and get in line for your top schools first. The representatives of the school will speak with you for a few minutes, take your resume and say thank you. If they like you they will contact you for an interview. Depending on the school there may be more than one interview. By the end of the weekend a majority of people will either have accepted a job or will be offered one in the next week or two.

If this does not happen continue to email schools. My first international teaching position was offered to be in mid July, so it is never too late. The work visa process is a bitch, but the schools walk you through it very well.

Here are the benefit packages all International School will give you:
-Health Insurance
-Free transportation to and from your point of origin in the summer
-Free furnished housing (depending on the school, some are one bedroom 1 bath, some are 3 bedroom 3 bath)

Some school will offer:
-Stipends for graduate degrees
-Transportation for shopping, museums and activities
-Tax free salaries
-Housing and insurance for a spouse and dependents

The salaries for international school are varied but here are generally the salary trends:

-Latin America will pay between $17,000-$35,000.

-The Middle East will pay between $35,000-$60,000.

-African Countries will pay between $20,000-$40,000.

-European Countries will pay between $30,000-$90,000. The best paying school are in Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

-Asia schools will pay between $30,000-$90,000. The best paying schools are in Thailand and China.

The best part is that these schools do not have unions, are not driven by test results and allow you much more freedom than public schools in the United States. After getting your foot in the door you can go anywhere and save much more money than in the United States. I know it may be scary to leave everything you know and experience a whole new world, but anyone can do this. It does not matter if you are single or married, kids or no kids, secondary or elementary, young or old, anyone can do this. 

I will try to answer any relevant questions you have. I hope this post can help someone who is frustrated with the educational system in the United States to find a fulfilling, well paying and exciting teaching position.

1dkhw1,12,2013-05-02,I was the victim of a mugging/attempted sexual assualt.,bradysaysblerg,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1dkhw1/i_was_the_victim_of_a_muggingattempted_sexual/,"I was mugged on Friday night. I was leaving a bar in the West Village at 1:30, walking uptown to get a cab back to queens. I took a right and immediately got pushed into a wall. He kissed me and started groping me grabbing my wallet from my pocket and phone from my hand in the process. He said “ I’m gonna fuck you right here.” The initial shock wore off and I managed to push past him and run. I got into the first empty cab I saw and told the driver my destination. We started moving and I said “..I think I got attacked.” He pulled over and told me to get out. I started running again and got to another cab. We got to 50th street and I realized that I must have dozed off. I felt my pockets and realized I didn’t have anything. I said something to the cab driver about how my wallet was gone and I had no money. At this point I was in shock or denial or something. Almost like I had forgotten what happened entirely. My first thought was that I left my stuff at the last bar or in the first cab. The cab driver said “You can’t pay me?! Well you’re going to jail. If you don’t pay me you’re going to jail.” I started crying and as soon as we stopped I got out and ran. I ran as far and fast as I could until I had to stop to throw up on the sidewalk. At this point I realized my jacket was gone and I convinced myself that I left my wallet and phone in the pockets. I started walking back downtown in the direction of the bar. On the way I ran into 2 police officers. I told them my stuff was missing and I had no idea where it went. Being inebriated, I stumbled a bit and their tone shifted immediately from somewhat concerned to condescending. They told me to revisit the places I went that night in the morning and I decided to keep walking. A while later I made it back to the nearly empty bar on Christopher and 7th. My jacket was on the back of the chair I had been sitting in, the pockets empty. I told the bartender that my stuff was gone. I had no idea where it was and didn’t know if I left it in my jacket pocket or in a cab, completely blocking out the fact that I had been a victim of an attack. She saw how hard I was freaking out, gave me the bars phone number and hope that someone picked up my stuff by mistake and would return it as well as $20 to get home. I was sitting on the N train looking out the window with tears in my eyes when it hit me that I had been attacked. I made it back to my place around 5am. My roommate let me borrow her phone to call my mom and I told her what happened, her knee jerk reaction was to be angry at me for drinking and then she started canceling my phone service and credit cards. I passed out on my bed in tears and woke up to my sister handing me a bagel and explaining what I needed to do to get my life back together for the last week of my internship with no money or phone in New York City.


To the Bartender who gave me money to get home:
You saved my ass. Neither of us had any idea what was going on and you offered me support when I needed it the most. I hope you like those cupcakes that I dropped off when I returned the money. I would have waited for your shift to start but just being in the same neighborhood, I was having a panic attack, and could barely breathe when I told the bartender the story.


To Stand-Up Comedian Jen Kirkman and her manager:
Saturday evening I had tickets to see Jen Kirkman preform at the Bellhouse. Having no way to prove I was 21 I assumed I wouldn’t be allowed in. It was a stroke of insane, you being in the same restaurant as me when I met my sister and her roommate for dinner before the show. You were really confused when I walked over and said “I hate that I’m being this person….. but I’m huge fan and I was wondering if you could sign my book.” You immediately smiled and said of course. I told you I wasn’t sure if I would be able to get into your show since I had been mugged. Your agent promised me she’d get me in. You wrote “Brady, Nobody better steal this book! XOXO Jen Kirkman” and gave me a hug before you left. I got into the show and when you were doing the impression of your mom, everything that was happening in my head was gone. When you asked two guys under 25 onstage, I sprinted up. You gave me a hug, seeming genuinely excited that I got in. You’re a good person, Jen Kirkman.


To the police officers who took my report last night:
I get it, I waited a long time to file. It makes your life harder, but maybe for one second consider that I’m freaking out and that sympathy might be in order. I don’t know what the right way to approach the situation and remain professional was, but I do know that you saying “So you almost got raped and waited 5 days to tell us?” was not the right fucking thing to do. It took everything I had to not just say fuck you and go back inside my house. You don’t fucking understand the kind of effect that has on person? That maybe berating me isn’t the way to go? That the shame and disgust and anger and embarrassment and sadness I’m feeling isn’t enough? You have to pile another load of guilt on my shoulders? What is wrong with you? I was finally in a place where I felt comfortable and sure enough in what events actually occurred that I was willing to tell an authority about it, but all of the strength I confidence I had rebuilt over the last 5 days vanished in an instant. I’m the kind of person that rationalizes behavior “well maybe they’re having a bad day or they just lost their phone or something” NO. You don’t deserve that. You made the victim feel like shit and are therefore doing it wrong. I regret reporting the sexual assault that was committed against me because it would have saved me a panic attack and a sleepless night if I hadn’t spoken to you on Wednesday. 


To my long distance boyfriend:
All I wanted was to be held after it happened. You are a few states away and when I see you on Monday, you promised to console me as much as you could. I want to apologize for piling all my shit on you. I was already a little broken coming into this situation and when I was attacked, I shattered. I hurt a whole fuck ton and I don’t know how to make it hurt less. I don’t know what the fuck it is that hurts but it’s unbearable and I can’t reconcile it with myself. Thank you for trying. I love you so much… you deserve a lot better than me, but the fact that you are here and waiting patiently for me to get back so you can hold me and tell me everything is alright, means everything and is the only thing I need right now. You’re one of the best things that ever happened to me. 


To my family:
My family is a constant source of support. I’m famous among you guys for solving problems before they are problems, but I don’t have a solution for this one and when I really need you, you’re here. Thank you. 
To everyone at work who offered help should I need anything: 
I’m basically a stranger to most of you and the amount of support and concern I was offered was incredible. You are all good people and help me restore faith in humanity


To my best friend in the world:
You have no idea how much you helped. Commending me for getting away and for being brave enough to talk about it. Reminding me about the great things in my life and telling how happy you are that I’m part of yours, talking about how your former mentor now has a lot to teach you. I love you. I’m so glad that you’re still in my life, that you love me, and are excited for my success and happiness, that being 6000 miles away hasn’t changed our relationship, and that you were the first one I came out to. I wouldn’t have rather told anyone else.


So reddit make me feel better, in the last 6 days I met the worst and best of humanity. How the fuck do I move past this? How do I make the panic attacks stop? What about this is hurting me so much? I didn’t even know what was happening when it happened. I do I defend myself if it happens again when I’m fighting against something that I am oblivious to? I just fucking need someone to tell me what to next.  

TL;DR: What the fuck do I do now?"
1dkhoz,2,2013-05-02,"""Taking space"" from SO (23/M) of roughly 3.5 years is causing me to be depressed (22/F). Lots of text, but I really could use some help.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dkhoz/taking_space_from_so_23m_of_roughly_35_years_is/,"I'm sorry for the wall of text, but I just cannot explain how I feel now without giving all of our background. I'm leaving out a lot of details just because I do not want to broadcast every bit of our relationship. I just really need some help. There is a TL;DR at the end if you just scroll down one mile.

My (ex)boyfriend and I have had a lot of problems. All of these problems stemmed from a decision he made when we first starting dating to not tell me something. He told me this thing two years into our relationship. At the time, what he told me absolutely crushed me. Now, it doesn't bother me at all. 

After he opened up to me about what he had been hiding, things just got bad. We fought on and off for about a year. I resented him so much for lying to me and not being as empathetic as I needed him to be. We were stuck in a really shitty situation because of his roommates that caused more stress on our relationship. We fought and fought and eventually, after a few months of knowing his secret, he decided he needed to take some time to think about our relationship. 

That, the idea of losing him, immediately made me change my ways. I wanted to let go of the resentment and I wanted to stop holding the situation in which we had no control against him. I did a pretty decent job of it, but really I was just suppressing my hurt. More than anything, I just wanted us to live up to our potential to be the happy couple we used to be. We used to be the couple that every other couple envied and that all of our single friends wanted to find a relationship like. 

We were happy for a while, but eventually my passive aggressiveness and his frustration from not finding a job (he was graduating) got the best of both of us. He took his stress out on me and I took my hurt out on him again. We started fighting again, but not nearly as bad as before.

Summer came and I had an internship near his home town. He still hadn't found a job so he moved him, which was about 30 minutes away from my new apartment. This was the lowest point of our relationship. I had moved on from my hurt and pain, but I still resented him for a lot of reasons. I never felt appreciated. Especially over this summer. I had helped him through and been there for him through a lot of problems; this was over two and a half years into our relationship at this point. He took his stress from being jobless out on me completely. He did a lot wrong that summer and I was heartbroken. Eventually, it got so bad that I had to break up with him completely. I don't really want to go into detail about any of it, but I really had no choice on staying with him or not. 

We broke up but it wasn't ever really like we broke up. We stopped hanging out, but we talked nearly every day and still spoke to each other like we loved each other. He got incredibly jealous at this point and then did something that made me cut him off completely for a while. A few weeks later, he had a job an hour away from my hometown now. I moved back home to go back to school. We met up because we just missed each other. It was great, until the end of it when he went through my phone while I was in the bathroom. He found some stuff out he did not want to or need to find out. Stuff that happened while we were apart. We got into a terrible fight. We decided it wasn't the time to think about getting back together.

I've never been very strong when it comes to being the one that decides to take space. I always fail within a day or two. I continued to talk to him even though we were broken up. We didn't talk everyday, but we did talk at least probably three times a week. I wanted to get back with him, but I was so hurt from how thing went the past summer. I was heartbroken. Once he started his job, he completely turned himself around. He took responsibility for his actions and grew up a lot. But I just acted single. I was going out every single weekend, which is something I'd never done before. I was meeting guys, talking to guys, and even hooking up with them. But I continued talking to him. I'm not proud of how I treated him. I regret it and would change it in a heartbeat if I could. I led him on for a long time. The semester went on like this the entire time. Eventually January came and he told me he just couldn't do it anymore. He needed to move on. I didn't argue. I didn't fight it. I knew he needed to. We weren't close anymore and we hardly talked. 

I tried to move on and he did too. For a month we had nothing to do with each other. It was the longest we'd ever gone without talking. I couldn't move on though. Instead of liking him less and less, I love and appreciated him more and more than I ever had before. With each conversation I had, even with my closest friends, I started to realize how perfect for me he really is. I missed him a lot.

I ended up calling him. He answered and we felt the same way. We both wanted to meet up and talk and just fucking hang out like we used to. We met up the next day. Everything was great. It was so good seeing him. All the stupid bullshit just immediately left me. I was over every negative feeling I had just because I missed him. Leaving his apartment that night was probably the happiest I've ever been in my life. I really mean that. 

We started dating again and both eventually cut off those distractions we had started talking to while we were apart. We really started to change. Our relationship had made a completely make over. That was until the first night we drank together. We went to a restaurant and had a couple drinks. 

He ended up getting a little drunk and his jealousies immediately came to the surface. He started asking about different guys. We got into another fight. We took a day or two to cool down, something we had never really both agreed to do. That was the best thing we could've done. We both saw that it was stupid and moved on. 

After about two months, we considered each other boyfriend and girlfriend again. We were back together and better than ever. We finally sat down and talked about the semester immediately after we broke up for the first time. I started to see how bad I had hurt him. I felt horrible and insanely guilty. I ended up telling him about everything that I had done while we were ""apart."" He needed to know since we were talking the whole way through. I did not cheat on him, but again, I definitely led him on. Just typing that feels like a kick in the stomach. 

He was mad, obviously. But he told me he wasn't going to break up with me. A couple days later, we hung out again for the first time. Things didn't go well. We didn't fight, but there was tension. 

He was supposed to move back to my hometown to go back to college. He was going to start moving his stuff back here last Saturday. His plan was to drop off his UHaul at his friends and then come spend the evening with me. He got to my house, we went back to my room, and he broke up with me. 

He said he's just really mad at me right now and he just really needs some time to move on from that anger. He also told me he's moving back to his mom's house and he's leaving tonight. He's moved four hours away. I was hearbroken and completely in shock. I'm still kind of in shock five days later. We aren't going to speak for four weeks. No talking whatsoever. 

We are most definitely going to get back together. He just needs time to get rid of his anger so he isn't just taking it out on me. He said that if he doesn't get a chance to let go of this anger, he's going to act on it and eventually it will drive us into the ground all over again. I understand that completely. That's what I did that drove us to break up in the first place. 

We plan to fully get back together at the end of summer, if not before. I completely believe him. We still love each other very much. We still want to be with each other forever. We had, before I told him everything I did while we were apart, been in the best place of our entire relationship. I loved him more than I ever had and in a way I never had before. We had both made very obvious changes. All of our problems at first came from a petty, immature, and prideful place. Since then, we've both moved away from that. 

I really love him. But it's hard to go through this. He's doing it for us. He's not doing it for himself. He wants to be with me right now just as bad as I want to be with him, but he knows it won't work in the long run if we get together now. It'll just be a short lived try. This is for the better of our relationship.

It's hard to keep that in mind all the time. I'm still just really sad from how he left. I'm devastated. Really, he probably did everything in the best way possible. I'm just really lonely. I lost that person I can talk to about everything. I know I'll get it back, but right now it's really hard. I'm finished with classes so I have nothing to do everyday. I am going to get a job. But right now, I'm even too sad to go out and talk to people about getting one. My two closest friends are busy. One of them lives a few hours away. My other is a school teacher here, so she's busy most of the day. I live with my mother, but she's at work all day. I'm just alone. I have plans for this evening, but still. I've spent most of this week alone. I'm crying for hours each day. Or screaming and yelling in frustration. I don't want to leave my bed. I don't want to do anything. I know once I find a job, it'll be easier because I'll have something to do. Something to look forward to. I've looked into volunteering, but I cannot find anything that's actually going on this month. I'm just really fucking lonely and it's making it hard. 

I know this is the right thing. I know it'll be worth it in a month or at the end of summer, when he moves back. It's just hard to keep sight of that all the time. I don't really know what to do.

Typing everything out, getting it out of my head, has made me feel so much better. It's reminded me that this is the right thing. It's the first mature move we've ever made in our relationship. But it SUCKS. I guess I just want to know if anyone had had any sort of similar experience and how they made it through. I just need some positive and uplifting words. Some encouragement. I know this is right and I know, from the bottom of my heart, that we will be very happy together, but right now, we have to spend time apart. 

**TL;DR** My (kind of ex)boyfriend and I have had a lot of problems based coming from pettiness, immaturity and pride. We've finally moved past that, but now he needs some space to move on from his current anger so he doesn't let his resentment run us into the ground. It'll probably be the best thing we've ever done for our relationship, but I'm still incredibly sad and feel hopeless. I miss him a lot and am trying to find ways to fill up my free time. I just want some encouragement from anyone that's been in the same position. Thank you!"

My name is Alex Crockett. My grandfather's name was Theodore Roosevelt Crockett- Ted for short. Ted grew up in Greenville Mississippi at the heart of the delta, one of 22 children to the same mother. When he was a young teenager Ted left home to work and live in Detroit, then the world famous factory city so many like my grandfather left the south for. After working in factories in Detroit and eventually settling in New Britain Connecticut, Ted became a staunch labor advocate, travelling around the world, forging connections with powerful figures, and always fighting for the dignity and humanity of American workers of every race color and creed.
My grandfather did this with an 8th grade education.
Earlier this year, Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma introduced and ultimately passed legislation to cut all funding to political science programs through the National Science Foundation that did not ""promote national security or the economic interests of the United States"".
I built my summer around attending the Ralph Bunche Summer Institute at Duke, a program that has a famous track record for preparing minority students to enter graduate school.
The Senate has sent a message in their decision that training minorities to identify and combat inequality in our country is not of critical importance.
I think my grandfather and the rest of my family would disagree.
So here is where I currently stand. My mom and dad have worked feverishly for their entire lives in the hopes that my sister and I might attend college. Both close to 60 years old, my dad recently lost his job due to the horrific climate of the insurance industry, and my mother works close to 7 days a week as an E.R nurse, often 12 hour shifts.
Like many families it has been a struggle to pay for my enrollment at Goucher College, even though I receive scholarships and financial aid.
This summer the Bunche Institute had potential to start me down the path to entering political science and social justice work at a professional level and hopefully increase my chances of alleviating the burden of my debt on my parents. Unfortunately this was not a vision shared by the United States Senate.
I was notified of the termination of the program in early April, giving me just enough time to apply to another program recommended to me by the faculty and president of my college.
The Hansard Scholars Programme is an 8-week summer institute with the London School of Economics in which students have an internship with a member of parliament.
The London School of Economics (LSE) is an incredible institution that many of my heroes have attended and I have been heavily recommended to consider it for graduate school (which would be unreal). Unfortunately I could never afford to travel to the UK and interview or work with the faculty and administration my professors have suggested without some form of sponsorship.
If I fail to raise at least $4,000 I will not attend the program under any circumstances.
Given my graduation next year, this is a pivotal point in my education and a once in a lifetime opportunity that I know I won't take a second of for granted.
No matter what happens I plan on dedicating my life to investigating and fighting the causes of poverty and inequality, but I genuinely believe this trip could greatly enhance my capacity to do so.

Overall it went well; I got a few messages of support and only one remotely negative email. The first message I got was by far the best:

&gt;Stargleam52 you are my hero, and I have nothing but support to offer you.  
You are much stronger than I am.  
You are so much stronger, in fact, that I'm still hiding from who I am. I am dating a person who shares the same SRY-gene status as myself, and no one here in the land of the rising sun knows it but us.  
The internship I had here during the summer really helped me grow up and accept my own feelings, but I am still kiloparsecs away from confiding in more than a handful of my closest friends and family members.
but now maybe I am one step closer to sharing how I feel with a larger community, and I have you to thank for it...

I thought that was the best feeling in the world. I was wrong though, because today that person updated their status:

1dkbdd,1,2013-05-02,Need to choose a job,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dkbdd/need_to_choose_a_job/,"So during my time in high school I worked at local Canadian retail chain Giant Tiger for 4 years before leaving off for university.  I am back in my home town in the summer.  My parents are poor, I live broke but I do what I can to make sure that I stay in school which means that I have to try to work as many hours as I can during the summer.

For the second summer in a row I am returning to Giant Tiger, they offer me about 20 hours a week but with call ins I almost always end up with around 35 hours a week. 

I recently have been given the opportunity to take up a job as an intern for a downtown development position which has to do with dealing with numerous local businesses and event planning which would be amazing experience for my resume as I am a business student.  This job is 35 hours a week guaranteed, sometimes more.  So my plan was to work weekends and occassional evening shifts at Giant Tiger and work the intern job racking me up about 50-60 hours a week.  The main catch with the intern job however is that it ends at the beginning of August.

I didn't see it as a problem but when Giant Tiger found out the managers started bullying me about it. 2 managers each one at a time confronted me on the floor telling me that I better not take this intern job as they want me to cover shifts and if I am not available to the shifts they want me to then they don't want me here.  The managers seem completely unwilling to negotiate but I want to try to explain to them my situation more formally.  

I have been working with Giant Tiger for years, am a known hard worker and well loved among the staff, not to mention that I always take extra unscheduled shifts without even a grunt and this is the way they treat me.  They have many other staff with barely any hours who are looking for more hours but insist that I be there to take them rather than just giving the hours to the other people.

I am broke and need to make all the money I can, so if I stay at Giant Tiger I will likely make more money however I can not get a second job while there.  If I get a job with the city it is great job experience for my resume but it ends in august and now I'm unemployed for a month.

My husband and I are moving to Denver to attend graduate school at the University of Colorado Denver this fall for  Urban Design and Public Administration with a Nonprofit Management focus.  We are looking to network with people in those professions as we are trying to obtain part-time employment during our studies and also looking to the future for staying in Denver after graduation.  

**Who we are**

* Husband - Received his BA in architecture in 2012 and has worked the past two years, full-time at a landscape architecture firm.  He is looking to get into urban design and planning.  Possible internships he has noticed are with RTD and other firms in Denver.  If anyone is currently working at a firm hiring or has interest in connecting for future exchanges that would be much appreciated.
 
* Me - Received a BS in political science and psychology.  I have been working in professional settings for the last three years and currently work at a conflict resolution non-profit.  I am passionate about education and youth and hope to work for an organization such as Stand for Children.  I would really love to talk to anyone in the nonprofit/education realm in Denver to understand more about the issues that face the area and what kind of job opportunities there are.

At 18 years old I obtained $20K + interest from a settlement when I was 3, all is currently invested in mutual funds, hasn't made much, but didn't lose anything either.  Until turning 20, I had only worked minimum wage food service jobs and never had more than 2 grand in the bank.  Part of the reason is that 50% of what I made (matched by my father) went to a Roth IRA that had probably like 4-5K in it at my 20th birthday.  

Fast forward to April of this year, 3 grandparents died and I got 8 grand from one of them.  Father put 5K in my Roth acct, now just under 10K, and the rest is in checking.  I haven't spent much, but I did buy myself a computer, otherwise tried to save for gas and whatnot.  This summer I'm working an internship @ $20/hr full time for 12 weeks, so I'll have about 9000 more after this summer.  

I know keeping 10 grand in a wells fargo checking account is pointless, especially when they try to charge me a 13$ monthly service fee every time I blink, but should I do something specific with it?  Move it to something else?  Also, when should I try to start building my own credit, and how would you go about doing that? ($300 max cash backed card, or real credit card or something else?)  Anything else I should do with my money that's already invested?"

I'm about to be starting college soon, and I'm having trouble choosing which engineering field to focus on for my career. I'm torn between ME, AE, and EE. 

To help explain where my interests fall, here are my favorite independant projects that I've done thrugh high school:

* helped design an electric HALE UAV of an internship
* designed a gatling-gun
* designed a NM/TNM/TMETN jet engine 
* designed a bulpup rifle
* designed an 8-shot t-shirt cannon revolver
* designed and am building a railgun
* designing/building a new type of audio effects pedal
* designing high-power betavoltaic power cell
* designing an atmospheric ion thruster

I'd honestly want an interdisciplinary engineering degree (major in Mechanical/Aerospace, minor in electrical), but the only college I know of that offers that is MIT (I'm hoping to transfer there after a year or two at another college, but that's easier said than done). I'm definitely sure that I want to be on the R&amp;D side of engineering, but besides that, I don't know what to choose.

Sorry for the wall of text; I'll try to respond to any questions as soon as I can.


EDIT: OP has returned! Sorry about the delay, I've been busy with my R&amp;D class, and my school just blocked Reddit. But I'm back."

HR said that I won't be needed a clearance for this position (summer intern) since it is a civilian contract, so I was just wondering why I needed to do this? For records with them? Most companies I worked with just did a criminal history check/financial record check.

Also, it asked about drugs. I took 5mg of Adderall about 9 months ago. It was a one time deal for studying. Would this affect anything? It asked for last use/date and it feels kind of shitty writing down that I did this not even a year ago. But aside from that I normally don't do drugs.

Is there anyone that can comment on this?

I started a throwaway account because I'd like to share a little bit more personal detail about my situation.  Here it goes:

29 years old.  Married.  Two kids born in '08 and '10.  Graduated in 2011 in Construction Management with $27k in student loans.  I was working in an internship that rolled into a full-time job at $45k/year after I graduated.  

My wife and I both fell into the trap of thinking ""We deserve some sort of reward for all the hard work we've done"" and went out and got two cars totaling $20k in loans.

A few months later we saw the light after sitting down and putting a budget together to see when we could realistically have a good down payment for a home.  We were saving ~$300 while making the minimum payments on all of our debt.  A down payment seemed impossibly far away.

One thing led to another and over the next 19-20 months we sold both cars and replaced them with a beater that I bought for $1 from my father-in-law, and a $3000 car that we bought from my wife's grandmother.

After a year at my job I got a promotion and a raise to $55k/year and by then we were aggressively paying off our debt.  Just this past March I got another raise to $62k/year and a $6k bonus that helped push us to make our last lump sum payment towards our [student loan debt](http://i.imgur.com/AVDk6Ql.jpg). 

What I'm actually most proud of is that we've cut our monthly expenses down from ~$3200/mo to $2100/mo while our income has increased dramatically.

We're now saving ~$1800/mo towards an emergency fund and a down payment on a house as our two bedroom/two bath apartment is feeling a little small as our kids get older (and bigger).

Sorry for the wall o' text.  Like I sad at the beginning, I hope my experience can help and inspire someone else to keep pushing.  My wife and I haven't been on any vacations, birthdays and Christmas are on the cheap, and it hasn't been very ""fun"" but definitely rewarding in the end."

I haven't been able to find a job since. I didn't manage to land a single internship - paid or unpaid - during school (and for the first half I was working full-time before my company laid me off) and have no real legal experience. I haven't taken the bar because the industry is essentially dead unless your parents work at a firm or you went to a better school than I did (Suffolk - because I had to go nights.)

I've tried to go back into market research (job I was laid off from) but can't get hired there either. I've been selling odds and ends using Craigslist deals and Amazon to get by while working for free for a year as an ""intern"" with a startup in Boston. They paid my commuting costs and it never turned in to a job. 

I applied to the Startup Institute to try and find a path to a job that way but was rejected. I feel like it was because I'm too old (30). I am applying for entry level jobs against fresh grads or against my more experience peers who didn't go back to school.

I've applied to nearly 200 jobs since graduating and have had a dozen interviews  - some 2 or 3 levels - but no job.

I can't go on like this. I don't feel entitled to a dream job, but I feel like I've spent years of school and work and they count against me. For all the talk, you can't ""do anything"" with a law degree. It's a free excuse to be discriminated against for every position."

Here's a timeline of what's going on (by the way, I graduated with a degree in graphic design):

* had internships and freelance work (by opportunity) between 2009-2012

* last job experience/intenship ended December 2011 (basically, end of resume.. *read on*)

* decided to focus on school spring 2012, graduated in May 

* made the terrible/regretful/normal(?) decision ""Hey, this will be my 'last summer vacation', so I'm going to enjoy it until September.""

* September came and went, was starting to look for work with no luck

* hardships occur (a lot may interpret them as excuses, but I saw them as legitimate reasons to stay home)

* got a job December 2012 to work in-house, but quit Jan '13 because of the terrible pay, horrible boss/co-workers

* work several part-time jobs non-related to design (obviously excluding from resume)
* currently unemployed but always actively looking 
 
I have not produced any portfolio worthy pieces since then nor did I include my last design job (Dec. '12) in my resume.

1djqmg,3,2013-05-02,How long is too long to wait?,rship,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1djqmg/how_long_is_too_long_to_wait/,"My bf [21m] and I [21f] have been together for almost 4 years, and we lived together for the past 2. We attend university together, and are graduating this spring. 

My bf is constantly busy with a few spurts of rest in between. He pays far less attention to the relationship in these periods than I do. I extend the same level of affection, desire and attention towards him, no matter how busy I am. Granted, he says he's always busier than me, and I can't really argue that with him. He definitely takes on WAY more work than I do, and really extends his limits. So, he stresses himself out way more than he should, but he gets great satisfaction from his hard work. This brings me back to my point: he works so hard and has very little time for me, even though we live together. We barely ever have sex, cuddle, spend quality time together, talk about  meaningful things that don't involve HIS work, etc. All of this is because of him, not me. I give him plenty of massages when he asks for them (which is at least every few days, oftentimes a little every day). If he wants to nap from 1am to 3am, but I clearly want to just sleep, I'll stay up to make sure he wakes up (he's a very heavy sleeper), thus sacrificing my sleep. I do this often for him. I make sure to wake him up in the mornings, too, even if it means I can't be to class as early as I'd like. I bring him meals when he's busy studying or working. I tell him I love him, I make it a point to hold his hand and let him know how proud I am of him. In return, I get very little. I don't ask for much, just the basics. I have to ask for cuddling or sex, and even those requests are denied. 

He is always busy. When I bring up my frustrations to him, he reassures me that it's only because of the stuff he's busy with. That once it's over, he can give me the attention and affection I want, but for now, he doesn't have the time for it. It's always something different. Sometimes, it's being at his family home (he lives abroad on breaks), so he can't skype, email, text, call, etc. Sometimes, it's his school organization. Other times, it's his internship, job, classes, research, theses (he's doing more than 1), etc. There's always something that takes up ALL of his time, leaving next to nothing for me.

I've been very patient, just waiting for this stressful period to be over. I've gone over a month without sex. Minimal cuddling time. I had to practically beg for cuddling yesterday, and we only cuddled for a few minutes. He says 'I love you' sometimes. For the past several months, he often (over half the time) comes to bed (or even just home many times) very late, past 3am. The other day he came home at 7am. I always wake up around 8:30 or 9, and I'm a light sleeper, so I was upset because he disturbed my sleep again. It's even worse when he disturbs my sleep between 3-6am. Anyway, I feel like there's a lot going on in this post, but the gist of it is that I don't feel loved, appreciated, or that attention is being paid to me. The icing on the cake is that even though I've been so patient, I feel taken advantage of. My patience is wearing thin. He's been out to parties, socials, and friend's apartments while he's been busy, so he's definitely making time for other people. Why not me?

Is it this normal to be so busy, and to refrain from normal relationship activities? I understand needing stress relief, so I have no problem with him going to parties and having fun with friends. It's just that I'd like to think spending time with me, cuddling with me, talking with me, having sex with me, is a good stress-reliever, too. Almost important to note: although he doesn't have sex with me very often because he's busy, he masturbates every few days. He tells me it's because ""it's convenient"". He'll masturbate in the bathroom while I'm in the apartment with him. You'd think having a horny gf in the apartment with you is convenient enough, but nope. Apparently not. He pretends to be oblivious to my advances, saying I ""never initiate"". This is not true. I have to also ask him outright if he wants to have sex, and he usually declines because he's: busy, tired, stressed, has other plans, etc.

TL;DR: My bf is always busy, leaving little time for me. I'm starving for his attention. Is this normal in a relationship? "
1djq53,1,2013-05-02,I got fired from my internship and now my school is about to fail me.,Mylifeisover10005,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1djq53/i_got_fired_from_my_internship_and_now_my_school/,"I won't go into too many details but I got fired from my internship due to some actions on my part (non-malicious, petty kind of mistakes but I see why they fired me over them). I take responsibility for my actions, but the internship was a miserable experience as they were having me do stuff that wasn't applicable to the subject area.

Because I was fired from the internship, I stand to lose the course credit, and possibly fail my course of study program (the internship program where I am is very structured and it's quite a lot of work just for a simple internship).

My polite, professional appeal to the school internship supervisor fell on deaf ears (she's a cold hearted emotionless bitch who has taken this program way too seriously) and she basically treated me like I was a criminal. She's letting me write an appeal letter to her boss since he/she is making the final decision, but I feel its pointless because they seem to have their minds made up and it seems that the supervisor is not willing to let me speak to the boss directly.

I'm going into counseling tomorrow for advice and comfort, seeing as there may be more sensitive factors at play that I need help writing about, but I feel like my life is over. I wouldn't care so much about this if it wasn't for the whole school credit thing (without going into details this internship won't really affect me in the future), but I don't want a fail on my transcript, yet it seems I'm powerless to stop it.

TLDR: Got fired from an internship, school is letting me write an appeal to keep the credit but it seems they are already against me, if I fail credit my study program is in jeopardy, going to counseling for help tomorrow, life is over, MMFB."

Backstory: My boyfriend and I adopted a male kitten a few months ago, when he was about 2 months. Everything was swell, he was as adorable as you expect any kitten to be. He always had a weird ""insane"" look, but otherwise he is a fine healthy little thing. 

Everything was doing great, until my boyfriend left fro three weeks for an internship. The kitten started spraying, but since we couldn't (and still can't) have it neutered right now I didn't formalize myself and became friend with baking soda. 

I don't actually mind the occasionnal spraying, but now he has become terribly aggressive towards my boyfriend since he came back. He keeps biting, clawing etc. He also started a war on his personnal belongings, doing about 500 euros of damage over the past month. Oh, and he stays up all night, alterning meowing with destruction (he also does it during the day, but at night it's a bit more tedious).

We can't have him neutered right away, because of money and time issues, we plan to do so as soon as the finals are over. I guess I am looking for some advice on how to resolve this issue, or a way to calm him down until we can schedule a vet appointment (I am not convinced that removing his kittenly parts will resolve this issue completely however).

TLDR: Male kitten of about 6-7 months has become super aggressive after bf left for 3 weeks. Can't get to a vet to neuter him right now. Please help."

1djjud,6,2013-05-02,"A work/school dilemma (job hunting issues) (also, kind of long)",[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1djjud/a_workschool_dilemma_job_hunting_issues_also_kind/,"Hi. I'm a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate who committed two major atrocities unto getting hired:

* Didn't get an internship (I never got more than a few automated rejection emails for hundreds of applications.)

* GPA was a mere 2.93.

I'm a published technical lead author and spent two years doing design work on technology for a national laboratory that my team itself patented, and I'm getting between 4-6 job rejections emails daily. I have over 1,300 emails in my 'job hunting' email account from the last three months from looking for work. 

I had to move back in with my parents after graduating and the amount of money I have to my name will be in double digits soon. (I was fortunate to graduate with only 4k in debt; I think the Fed is going to be asking for repayment for that in about a month.)

But, I do have a single acceptance letter from a graduate school (two others should get here eventually, hopefully. It's May already; it's taking forever.) However, I'll be buried under at least a few dozen thousand dollars of debt and will be struggling to make money in the meantime. (I've already been denied any assistantships for the first semester, meaning my gameplan is show up and pray I can find a job immediately. I should also note my parents are helping me move out.)

Factoring in all of this, I'd much rather work now and worry about such luxuries as 'higher education' if I can ever afford it. On the other hand, if I don't take the grad school offer and can't find work, then I'm in another heap of trouble. On the other other hand, I might fail graduate school (my 2.93 wouldn't fly) or I might be just as seemingly undesirable as I am right now anyways or I might not be able to afford it from the get-go anyways.

I know networking is (almost literally) everything, and since I graduated from a puny school in the middle of nowhere spending every career fair getting scoffed at by big lab HR reps, I'm at a loss. I was forced to move to my current location as a kid and have been working ever since to get out. 

**I guess what I'm asking is,** given my grad/work situation: On the school side of things, given my situation, is there anything I should know or consider? On the work side of things, what should someone in my position do? I've never had the slightest chance to work in the field for actual money, so I'm just hung out to dry. Are there people I should be talking to? I'm not picky. I can relocate just about anywhere in the country given a solid chance to work somewhere (I also have zero opportunities where I currently live and I've always, *always* wanted to get the hell away from where I am right now.)

I'm a recent ME graduate who wants to relocate anywhere in the country for entry-level work, but I haven't gotten the slightest acknowledgement from any recruiters. What should I do?

I [21F] met my (currently long-distance) boyfriend [22M] two summers ago, when I had an internship in the same small town that he lives in.  He hung out with the other interns and I a few times, I realized he was interested in me, I thought he was cute, there was a party (I didn't drink; he did a little), we had the most perfect first kiss... and it's been complicated ever since.


I won't go into details about the backstory here because I don't want to subject you to that wall of text.  Short version: there was a lot of drama with another guy I was tangled up with in college, my parents disapprove quite strongly, he is head-over-heels in love with me despite how awful I've been in the past.  oh, and did I mention drama?


So fast-forward to present day: I graduated college last spring with two degrees and am in a top graduate program for my field (computer science).  He had dropped out after his sophomore year as a theater major (right before I met him) and after a year and a half living at home is now moved out and working the night shift at a 24-hour diner.  He wants to go back to school and eventually become a librarian, which I fully support.  But I'm frustrated because he has shown very slow signs of progress towards this goal.  For instance, he absolutely loathes his current job and keeps talking about finding something new, but on his days off ends up playing board games with friends or watching TV... he's put in an application at one place so far (that I've heard about, at least).


I'm wary of saying anything, though.  He dropped out because he was doing poorly in school because he was battling mental health issues - depression, anxiety, OCD, ADD.  That's not something I hold against him; it was the right decision for him to make at the time, and I have a lot of issues myself, so I get it.  I know he feels bad enough about his current situation and I don't want to make him feel worse about himself.  I try to encourage him, I even looked up job ads for him and offered to proof his resume or help him make a budget, but he hasn't done anything yet.


To top it all off.  I mentioned my parents disapprove strongly.  This is relevant because he has told me he wants to marry me (actually, the words were ""goddammit, I'm going to marry you someday, I know it!""..).  I would like my parents to approve of such a relationship, however, there is no way that they will change their minds as things are right now (several other reasons notwithstanding).  I wouldn't be in a relationship with him if I saw no way for that to be possible (and I've told him that), but... it's not possible right now, and that doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon, and I'm worried.  Since I've known him, he has gotten the motivation to move back out and get a job, which is certainly a step in the right direction; but if I'm being brutally honest, I never knew him as a student and I feel like my encouragement that he's great and smart and capable is starting to fall flat, because since I've known him he hasn't done any of that sort of thing.  I have my own set of self-esteem issues and depression/anxieties as well and when things get bad, worry that we just got carried away and aren't good for each other, etc., and it's just generally not a good time when that happens.  There's just so many things right now that need to change before even engagement is a realistic possibility that I tend towards despair ... (and even then, I'm still sometimes not sure if we're right for each other because of other things (big ones being religion and kids)... but I honestly don't think I'll find anyone else who would care about me like he does... but I don't want to waste both of our time if it's not right... etc.) :\


So if I had to condense all this into questions - how do I approach this situation?  Do I tell him straight up, ""you have no chance unless you step it up""?  Or what is a reasonable time frame to wait for him to get back on his feet?  How can I be sympathetic but still let him know how important this is to me?


(and anyone who read all that, thank you.)

I got accepted to Hofstra as a transfer student for next fall, and since then I have almost exclusively heard only TERRIBLE things about the school from current students. The consensus is that it's just a generally depressing place to attend school because so much of the student population is apathetic and not very bright (I knew about the entitled long island kids but figured I could just avoid them), that the surrounding neighborhood and bars in the area suck, that the school is dead on the weekends because half the campus commutes and goes home, that the people are unfriendly, and that there's just generally not much to do on or off campus.I figured the high price of tuition was worth it for its proximity to the city for internships and the fact that the it has a slightly better reputation than my old school, and one that claims to be getting better and better, but now I'm not so sure of it's reputation as a good school anymore either. I wish I had done this research earlier, and could kick myself for not looking at other schools. After hearing this same sort of stuff from student after student, I'm honestly ready to try and refund my registration and housing fees and get out of this while I still can. The school I'm transferring from is very sub-par academically, especially in my major (which is why I transferred), but despite being twice as big as Hofstra, was very close knit and had a diverse and friendly group of students who loved to go out and just generally have a good time, so there was always a party or event to go to on any given night. I'm a drinker, so I don't mind if most of the weekend activities revolve around partying and drinking, but I'm really shy, so it's not easy for me to make friends. I'm definitely going to put myself out there and try out different clubs and activities, but I feel as if I'm still going to be feeling homesick for my old school and friends and regretting my decision to leave. I guess it would be okay if I was a bit of a loner or was solely focused on the academic aspect of school, but I'm a really social person who's looking for a close-knit group of friends and go out with, and I want to be surrounded by cool, friendly people and a community that's vibrant and has school pride. Unfortunately, it sounds as if most of the people that go to Hofstra are just trying to get their degree asap so they can leave.

I really, really don't want to be miserable for the next two years. 

So, should I stay or should I go? Is the college atmosphere really as shitty as it's made out to be, or is it the experience at Hofstra only what you make of it? Is the high cost of tuition actually worth it, or are classes and administration really that much of a joke? If it's really that awful, I'd like to know now so I can find a school to transfer to that will have the college experience that I'm looking for.  "

I am glad about it, though I wonder that do I even deserve her? But that doesn't really bother me. What does is that, does she love me the way I love her? If you think I doubt her, then you are VERY wrong! Doubting her is beyond me. She can never and I mean never cheat on me or think about someone else as long as we are together. In fact, there have been times when she has told me about fellow batch mates telling her that they have a crush on her. But what worries me is this ""Is she THAT into me?"". 

Let me tell you something about her. She is beautiful, an angel in herself. She is sweet and cheerful, has a smile on her face always and talks to everyone with ease and makes them feel at ease. She has her own unique way of living life, does what she believes in - irrespective of what the entire world believes around her. I am sure whoever knows her, respects her for the kind of girl she is - principled and untouched by most of life's pleasures like drinking, smoking, etc. Some may call her orthodox and uptight. She says she doesn't care. And I am sure she doesn't, otherwise she would have given in the peer pressure that exists regarding such stuff in a management school. Well I guess this is the reason I love her so much!

It hasn't been long since we have been seeing each other - just about a month. When she first told me that she likes me too, two days later she said she wasn't sure if she wanted a relationship. I know being in a relationship was new for her, a big change in her life. And knowing the way she is - closed to any change in life and extra thoughtful in everything, I knew she can think about it all her life without being sure. I didn't ask her to take a decision at that time itself, just spoke to her as friends for hours. I asked her again a few days later and she said she likes me. That was all that I wanted to know. 

College is off on a term break and we speak every day on phone. It is normal. But I have known since always, it is not easy for her - to accept me or rather anyone in her life. And so I fear sometimes that some day she would just say to me that she can't handle it. We meet rarely these days as we both have an internship and the timing just doesn't fit. 

Last night when we spoke, it was normal. But at the end she said ""Let us meet tomorrow. I want to talk."" This did not freak me out. But after a long pause she added the two words ""about us"". She had certainly given it a deep thought as she said it on a Friday, because it was only possible for us to meet on the weekends. I felt like the moment had come which was the only fear I had about her. She will say to me, that she can't handle it. ""No! I cannot let that happen. I won't. Maybe I am just thinking too much. I'll meet her tomorrow and remove any doubts she has. I'll not let her go just like that.""

I was waiting for her at the decided place today. I had reached before time. When she arrived and I looked at her, there was just one thought in my mind ""She is the angel of my life"". She looked so pretty. Her open hair reaching half way to her waist. Her face bearing a smile as always. We greeted each other. We talked about how are internship was going, work load, etc. I wanted her to start that topic that I was fearing. But after about half an hour, I couldn't wait any longer. I asked her what she wanted to talk ""about us"". She became silent. She often got silent on such things. I insisted her to speak something. 

She looked at me with a strong gaze. Her eyes wanted to say something but I didn't understand. Her smile had gone - something very rare for her. I knew she wasn't going to say anything good. She was trying hard to speak and I waited patiently for words to come out. Finally she said, ""You are the only guy I said ""Yes"" to. You mean a lot to me. Do you like me the way I like you?"". Her voice trembled on the last line and tears came till her eyes. She fought them back. 

I cannot put in words what I felt at that time - supreme happiness, to say the least. I was speechless. I just hugged her tight and kissed her on the head. ""You mean everything to me, I like you veryyy much"" I told her. 

It is half past midnight. I just kept the phone down after talking to her. ""Yes I simply adore her and I won't let her go no matter what!"""

Wasn't sure where to post it. Don't care if no reads it, putting it all down is something i've been wanting to do. I don't even expect anything to help me at this point. I'll probably end up on anti depressants and if that doesn't work /r/suicidewatch is next. Feel free to waste your time reading what I wrote.**

I really really hate my life. I'm stuck in a major I hate, with people I hate and no other options. I applied to this university because my grades were shit going out of high school and had no other options. My grades are still pretty damn average (75-80%) considering what I wanted to do. Switching major or going to another university puts me back tremendously, its not really an option. 

I've always been into social science because I couldn't do math. I like the field somewhat but can't tolerate the people anymore. In a single year, I haven't met anyone that remotely interested me or shared anything in common. With the few people I liked, I could never push relations further.

I also realize that I won't be doing anything with this major. The internships don't really interest me and they don't pay for the most part. The students around me are only interested in drinking heavily, studying just enough to pass and aren't motivated to do much of anything in life. The culture at this university just really isn't for me. I'm being dragged into a mindset of mediocrity.

**Everything looks somewhat interesting, but not enough to dedicate all of my time into. I'm afraid of making decisions and going all into a single goal that I might end up regretting. This is a huge problem of mine and I have no idea how to overcome it.**

I'm posting this because I honestly have no clue what to do next. If I leave the major (it would be the third time I leave university) its back to square one and I doubt things will be any better. I have nothing going for me, no skills, hobbies (besides the internet). I just suck at everything. My parents would be extremely sad if I left university and so would I. They've been supporting me with everything they have and I would hate myself for doing that to them.

I have no motivation in life anymore. Just being outside makes me want to cry because not being on the internet makes me realize how little I have in the real world.  The online world is pretty much the only thing that makes me happy along with close friends. These close friends are in other, better universities and switching to those would be difficult. They have girlfriends, more friends than I do and tons of opportunities. Some will be leaving town soon, and i'll have just about no one to hangout with. 

Nothing interests me anymore and the few areas I like are filled with people I strongly dislike. The politics club for instance is mostly made up of people who believe the moon landing was a hoax, the Boston bombers were government agents etc... I thought going to university would allow me to have interesting discussion with more level headed people and I was so wrong. Its worse than high school. 

I've been seeing a psychiatrist who recommended antidepressants but I'm trying not to go down that road.

I'm sure some of you will say my situation doesn't sound that bad. I realize some folks have it much worse. Others and myself had much higher expectations about my future, and now I realize I'm going no where. 

TLDR: University sucks, the people are killing me. No motivation, circle of depression keeps going deeper etc... Really tired of this crap. "
1djc37,7,2013-05-02,Conversations of 5/1,thmage,talktostrangers,https://www.reddit.com/r/talktostrangers/comments/1djc37/conversations_of_51/,"Had a really productive day for talking to strangers. Here's a quick rundown, feel free to provide any pointers or questions.

#0: Ate breakfast alone in the dining hall.

#1: I briefly met this girl in Chem last week. I saw her sitting today, so I asked if I could join her. We had some nice small talk, covered some of the basics and slightly beyond. She's really shy, so it's taking more effort to keep a good conversational flow. But it was nice, and I could tell she enjoyed the talk.

Thoughts: While small talk is good for a beginner, it's really pretty boring conversation material. I should work on asking deeper/more exciting questions. Also, I need to be careful with how I talk to women. She's cute, but I don't really see much there, so I need to make it clear when I'm being friendly versus flirty so I don't lead anyone on.

#""2"": I went out to a student group, the same one that I had dinner with last week. I tried to say hi to most of the people I met last time. I did some basic chatting and found a seat for the presentation...

#3: This guy sat down near me, we made eye contact so I introduced myself with a handshake. We got talking about the club (he's new too) and his summer internship search and whatnot. I tried to make him feel comfortable at the meeting and encouraged him to check out future meetings.

Thoughts: It was nice to see everyone else, and I felt pretty good about saying hi to everyone. I noticed that I need to work on being more enthusiastic when meeting acquaintances. Also, I was proud of myself for remembering everyone's names, but I need to figure out how to weave it into my greetings. I couldn't figure out how to do that tonight. Also, I just need to be careful, cause I forgot #3's name until I said goodbye.

#4-5: After the presentation, I was schmoozing around, talking to a guy in one of my classes. We engaged the two guys next to us, who were talking about Yosemite. I got into a nice conversation with the guy (#4) about backpacking and camping and stuff. The other guy (#5) was a lot more shy, so I tried to talk to him. Asked him a bit about his major, and then about why he doesn't like it. Tried to encourage him about it's usefulness even if he works in another field.

Thoughts: It was nice finding an instant, interesting topic. I should work finding that in all my conversations. Even though it's harder to engage someone who's shy, it felt really good to get him to open up a bit.

#6: On my way home, two guys approached me to solicit about their religion. I was already on a roll, so I engaged them. I felt super sociable (great feeling), but I probably need to work on setting my boundaries. I ended up giving them my phone number even though I really don't want to meet up with them later.

It was awesome being so sociable, but I still have a lot of room for improvement. My current end-goal is to do cold approaches in the dining hall, but I still don't really feel comfortable with that yet. I also need to be more clear about platonic conversations. I'm getting better at meeting acquaintances and doing approaches in social settings, but I still have regular conversational skills to work on.

Please let me know how to improve! :)"

I've received two internship offers. I'm looking for advice as to which makes sense to take. Here's the facts:

I'm a sophomore at Cornell majoring in business (market and strategy). I've had an internship in ecommerce marketing (pretty much excel and analytics). One offer is from kbs+, an ad agency in NYC, working in strategy and analytics (essentially, using analyzing data and developing strategy and recommendations to then be used in marketing campaigns). The other is from Viacom (MTV specifically) in LA working with their client services reps, managing their marketing campaigns. Here's where it gets tricky. The pay is essentially equal. These are the considerations: I don't know which is more important at this stage- a good name on a resume (and almost definitely easier work), or a smaller name (but still great ad agency) and likely more experience? The work is in analytics and I don't want to risk specializing myself; I don't see it as something I can do for a career based on my dislike for a lot of math and previous internship experience (although different).

Here are some other facts- I live in northern NJ, commute is a non-issue. my girlfriend lives in LA, giving me somewhere to stay, also a non-issue. I've been in a long distance relationship for a couple of years and my gf is transferring for next year from NJ to CA. My dad is getting double hip replacement surgery in July, but has my mom to take care of him. The internship lengths are nearly identical, however Viacom would have me working only on Tuesday and Thursday while kbs+ is a full workweek. Smarter people will likely be at kbs+ and will be easier to talk to (in terms of proximity and company size), while Viacom has broader networking opportunities, which may prove extremely useful in my field. Also, I'm going to meet with an advisor tomorrow. Thanks a lot for any help you guys can give, and excuse any typos or anything- I've been studying for finals! Btw, I tried to sound unbiased; please try and take the information objectively, despite how I may have presented it. 

I ask this: which job do you recommend on a personal level, which is better professionally (future resume/networking), and why?"

I am currently learning Arabic and would love to become fluent (family is Palestinian.. have family in Jordan, so that is definitely an option). I was considering just looking into Arabic language programs, but would really like doing something where I get work experience and may or may not get paid (preferably paid...). I also speak Spanish pretty well (studied in Spain for a bit)

No criminal convictions

Yes, I'm willing to consider alternative destinations

Probably temporary...

I had heard that American companies and firms in the UAE might be interested in hiring western-educated graduates, but I'm not sure where to even begin.

Also, if there are non-Arabic speaking places where I might be able to work or intern in a PR firm (like the UK for example), how can I investigate further?

A little background information on myself:

23 year old male

about to graduate college


meditating off and on for the past 2 years... induced by a random/spontaneous kundalini experience- post concussion syndrome 


im a cool dude and very empathetic 

July 2012. 
I was living away from home working an internship when I got sudden news of my aunt being diagnosed with cancer. My aunt was one of my best friends and although the news was difficult I held my hopes high. What bothers me the most about this is that I only got to see her once before she lost her ability to speak.  We spent the last four months of her life communicating with our eyes and i could feel/see every emotion and feeling she was going through.  I would come home every weekend to visit her but the time i spent away at work during the week really effected me because all I could think about was my aunt and how i wasn't there for her at all times; this led me to turn inward and I've been stuck dealing with her loss ever since.

Whenever I meditate I can dissociate myself from these lurking feelings, however, its the opposite whenever I'm going about my everyday activities. 
I get an anxious feeling, somewhat like i'm dying. This feeling drowns out my concentration and leads to small bouts of depression. 

I feel like a part of me died with my aunt and I'm having trouble getting back to equilibrium because of this issue. If anyone can offer some advice on how to better cope with this issue or ways I can meditate on this experience it would be very much appreciated and helpful

1dj4t0,28,2013-05-01,I hate who I am,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1dj4t0/i_hate_who_i_am/,"I'm not really sure how else to say it. I'm too nice. I'm not assertive. I have no motivation to live to life the way I used to. Every day I wake up more depressed on the inside than I was the day before, but because I'm the ""leader"" of our social circle, no one can see it. My ""friends"" always use me to get stuff done for them, get alcohol, or generally plan out events so they don't need to expend their own effort. 

I haven't been on a real date in a few years. The girl I last tried with let me take her out under the assumption that it was a date, had a great time( going around to her favorite spots around town: romantic walk on the pier, restaurant on a lake front on the other edge of town, comedy show.. the works), pay for everything (I'm old fashioned this way), and then tell me she's seeing this other guy who ended up emotionally abusing her, but she really liked me and wanted me to wait for her because she didn't think she'd be with him much longer the way he treated her. She wasn't and again after the breakup, I expressed my interest in her and got the same response, citing that she wasn't ready to jump back in to anything, so I was patient with her because I really cared about her.

Cut to 6 months ago, that same girl, who I've naively held a candle for all this time because we've remained close friends in the interim, gets engaged. It's seemingly out of the blue, because she hadn't even mentioned that she'd been dating this guy to me in all our talks, but apparently it had been an ongoing thing that she didn't tell me about because she knew I had feelings for her. Naturally because I'm still crazy about her, I'm crushed. 

Every other girl I've ever dated has cheated on me, usually multiple times. Because I'm a doormat, I forgive them and take them back telling myself I won't do it next time, but she'll never do it again anyway so it won't matter. Of course I'd be wrong...This is one of my least favorite features, I always convince myself of the best in people, when in reality, a lot of people are fucking assholes.

I lost all motivation to succeed or better myself, put on 30lbs, started sleeping 10 hrs a night, skipping classes and alienating friends. I'd never do anything to hurt myself or others, but after copious self-reflection, I definitely hate who I've been my whole adult life thus far. Over the last 6 months I've seen all of my friends getting into what seems to be serious relationships or taking the ones they have to the next level. I've watched co-workers at my internship move on to better things. Even my younger siblings seem more together than me lately. 

I've tried everything I can think of to get over this, but keep coming up empty. My main problem is that I constantly come back to that girl. Even with her fiance she still complains (although much less frequently, and I've met the guy, he's genuinely a good guy) to me and mentions how she wished he was like me in certain respects. Every time I hear stuff like that, it's like a new wound I have to try and heal. 

The only resolution I've been able to come up with is leaving the whole area and never coming back. I know running away from your problems is a poor way out, but it's what I have.I graduate next fall, and the only thing I'm certain of after graduation is that I'll be moving away from everyone, deleting my facebook and skype, and changing my phone number so no one can reach me. I just had to get this out since the only friend I had to talk to about stuff like this is engaged, you guessed it, the girl. I've had no one to talk to for a long time and after next fall, I won't again, but it'll be by choice. I feel like that control will be the first step to changing who I am to be successful in the life I want to have.

Thanks for listening.

1dixoq,2,2013-05-01,Is it selfish that I [22F] don't want to move to his[23M] city?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dixoq/is_it_selfish_that_i_22f_dont_want_to_move_to/,"Info:Been together for 2 years, but have known each other for 5. Have talked about marriage, kids, the whole shebang, we are on board with each other on everything but are happy to just be dating for now. Neither one of us is looking to actually get married anytime soon. I really see a great future with this man. 

So, he is going to be graduating from law school in about a year (I know I know, the field is crappy right now). I am currently living in a majorish city south of him, about an hour away. We've been doing this distance thing for a bit, but we are really sick of it. Problem is, he says he will be mainly looking for jobs in the MAJOR city about an hour north of him (2 hours north relative to me). Problem is, I HATE that city. Maybe I hate the city because of how in love with my city I am, but regardless, I would hate to live there.

 Additionally, my currently city has a lot of job opportunities for my field. MAJOR CITY has some too, but not as many and the competition would be rough because of MAJOR UNIVERSITY. Right now I have a really nice job that treats me well that I can grow with. I plan on working full time and getting my master's online (my job is flexible enough where I can do a lot of school work on the clock) and then moving on to something more related to my masters.

 He always seemed ambiguous about where he would look for jobs before, but now that he is solidifying his internship prospects and job hunting, it is looking more and more like he is focusing on MAJOR CITY, saying that he has more connections up there via networking and stuff.

I truly love this guy and want to make this relationship work, but financially and emotionally, moving to be with him doesn't jive. I would be sacrificing my fledgling career and I don't think that is a good idea for me to do.

My question is, how selfish is it that I don't want to even consider moving up there? I KNOW he could find something down here in his field, but moving up there is basically a dealbreaker for me. Is this relationship dead in the water? Should I cut my losses now, or hang on and see what happens? 

**TLDR; I hate the idea of moving to a city, but should I suck it up for my bf?**

I'm studying a Bachelor of Commerce (Finance)/Bachelor of Laws dual degree.

I'm in my final year at the moment and only had the epiphany that I wanted to work in finance after internship deadlines last year - so I didn't apply for any finance internships. I have a little legal work experience and currently work part time in the legal field.

My GPA is around 4.5 on the Aussie scale (so around 2.5 on the American scale) across my degrees. Commerce and Law GPA are basically the same. The only silver lining is that my Finance major subject GPA is about 6.0 (3.7 ish on the American scale - hard to convert.)

I just got rejected from all major commercial banks in Australia (CBA, NAB, Westpac and ANZ) and now I'm thinking that I should have cast a wider net in terms of the programs I applied for. I didn't apply to UBS, JP Morgan, GS because I knew I wouldn't stand a chance. Generally they will flat out reject you unless you have a overall GPA of 5.0 (US GPA 3.0) or above and will not interview you.

My interest mainly lies in areas where macroeconomic trends have influence, and trading. So things like Forex and Derivative trading interest me, equities less so, and if I could eventually be involved in M&amp;A I would also be very happy with that.

My question is, where to now? I feel very confident I have the intellect and acumen for a position, but I've handicapped myself by not (A) working hard on my grades at university; and (B) getting SOME kind of work experience. 

I can probably get into a Master's of Finance at the end of the year, alternatively I suppose my only options are to apply for a (very) low level job in banking and try and work my way up or to work at a small finance business. I know some trading businesses will hire you simply on merit if you can come in and show you can make money. I don't want to get stuck doing Financial Planning or something like that because I feel that limits my ability to move out of that area, and also is a huge waste of what will be essentially 6 years of tertiary education.

I wish I could just do some sort of brokerage program like Will Smith in the Pursuit of Happyness but that doesn't seem to be very prevalent at the moment in Australia; certainly I've found no mention. of it.

What should I do? Another degree, or where should I try and start out to get some opportunities for an upward career shift? "

Lately, i have been fighting with depression and loneliness, and have had a lot of stress.  Story is below.

Last month, I took a class that went overseas, as part of it's study.  ever since, i have not been the same, and have not felt the same as I did before i went abroad.  On this trip, i became attracted to a girl, only to find out that she did not find me attractive at all.  I figured she is very busy, already had a boyfriend to take care of her, and didn't need me bugging her when we we got back (I tried texting her, and she never responded).  she appears to be happy, and I am fine with that.

Second part of the story, I have been frantically trying to find work (i am a college student) and have struck out, and not hear back from anyone, and if i had hear back and got an interview, everyone has politely said that they aren't looking for someone like me; someone with more experience in the field (it is an internship. how am I suppose to have prior experience if an internship cant even accept me).

Third, i have been trying to involve myself as much as i can with the clubs on campus, and have taken on leadership roles in them, and volunteered to help with events and i greatly enjoy helping and finally becoming a leader. however, i find myself stressed out beyond belief because of trying to maintain a higher GPA, involving myself as much as i can, and trying to find a job, and then facing the consequences of potentially not getting a job, and having to go back home for the summer, and be even more alone.

I do have people i hang out with around campus, however, most of them are close acquaintances, and not good friends.  I figure why should i sit with them, or close to them, if i am just going to not talk, or bum people out?  So I normally have been going off alone, and in that case, i am kind of isolating myself because i can now see the world for the place it truly is; a lonesome cruel place, that if you are the little bit different, or try to act different, you will be spewed out alone. All my good friends are back home, and i dont want to bother them with my problems, and put that burden on them.

this just felt like the best place to say all this.

I have about 10k in federal student loans out right now. I could get more from my school, but my parents (specifically my mom) are dead-set against it.

I was born and raised in a Christian home and was raised almost entirely in a single church.  For my early childhood I went through the typical church kid's experience, of Sunday School on the weekends and prayer before dinner.  Things went fine like this until I hit middle school.  I had always been on the shorter side of the spectrum when it came to guys my age, but in elementary school nobody really notices the difference.  However it really started to show in middle school.  By the time I hit eighth grade I was standing at a tiny 4'8'', the shortest kid in the school.  This immediately set me apart from my peers, combined with the fact that I tried to keep my head down, I was the perfect target for ridicule of any kid trying to look cool.  However my school didn't stop simply at teasing or making somebody an outcast.  

By the time I was halfway through my last semester of middle school I had had two attempts on my life.  The first was a boy trying to slam my head against the floor and the second was a girl pulling a knife on me.  Both times I was saved by the security officers of the school and the matter was resolved, but the damage was done.  I had as of this point spent nearly a full year thinking that people didn't see me as somebody worth being alive, and so I began to contemplate suicide.  I would have gone through with my plans if not for a neighbor of mine, an (at the time) eleventh grader who saw somebody in need and reached out as a friend, despite how it would have looked to his friends.  He never knew what he did in saving my life because I never told him what was on my mind.  Merely having someone to talk to and laugh with for the first time in over a year was enough.  He helped me survive to high school where things took a turn for the better, beginning with me growing eight inches in the summer between eighth and ninth grade, but the damage to my faith had been done.  I had it drilled into me as a survival instinct that I did not ask for help from anyone.  And so despite going to church and getting into the youth group at the church, I wasn't really paying attention and never grew in my faith.  Spiritually, I was stuck at age thirteen.  

I never really noticed this difference all through high school because things never really got bad.  I graduated and made the transition to college without incident.  However, in March of my freshman year, I received a call from my mother saying that my friend from middle school, the one who had kept me from killing my self, was found in his room after hanging himself.  I was beyond devastated and had no idea what to do with myself.  I became a social recluse, only leaving my room for meals and classes and begin to revisit thoughts of suicide.  A call two weeks later informed me that his journal had been opened and his last entry was him wondering how Jesus could have let the world get to such a state without coming for the Rapture.  This was where my faith died.  I couldn't process how such an amazing person could be allowed to fall so far, why he couldn't have someone come to his aid like he came to mine.  I wondered if there was something I could have done and threw myself into parties and alcohol to ease my pain and anger at God.  Before I realized it I was drinking 4 nights a week at age 18.  

I kept this up for several months and watched my grades plummet and found myself put on Academic Suspension by the school.  Being home got me out of the atmosphere of readily accessible alcohol and also gave me a chance to meet my friends mother, who was understandably a bigger wreck than me.  I had already told myself I would tell her what I had never been able to tell him, about how her son had saved my life and how much I had looked up to him for years.  For the first time in nearly five years I allowed myself to cry and cried with her for nearly an hour.  All the pain from middle school, my anger, my sorrow at loosing someone so important, all came out in that time taking a huge weight off my shoulders.  Suddenly my mind was more clear than it had been in years and I was able to see what my life had become clearly.  I was still unsure of what I was lacking as my faith, before I lost it, was so immature.

I spent most of my sophomore year of college trying to figure out what I was missing, what the hole I felt was but to no avail.  Looking back, I'm sure there were signs aplenty that I just didn't, or wouldn't see.  It wasn't until this previous fall that God decided to stop with the subtle hints and decided to beat me over the head with his desire for me to know him.  My roommate was having friends over for drinks and to just hang out and people came and went as they pleased, but the last two people to stay were a pair of girls form the BCM, a campus ministry and church group.  We talked for hours about our pasts and the question of faith came up.  I told them my story to that point and even talked about the sense of missing something.  It was here that they actually laughed.  The first girl, Jen, said that she had been praying for my roommate (an atheist) that God could act to bring her to the church, and upon receiving the text inviting her over, felt that God was pushing her to go.  Her friend, Kim, had felt something similar that she was supposed to go with Jen that day and so went with her when Jen invited her to come to our apartment.  Jen and Kim invited me to come to see what the BCM was all about, and after a couple of visits I found myself not only going to church on a nearly weekly visit but also going to my first bible study.  As of this semester I have turned my life completely back to God and have dove headfirst into His Word.  And low and behold my grades have improved, I have an internship at a lab here at school for the summer and a happiness I haven't felt in years.


I know this was a long post but I have felt a weight on my heart to share my story with as many people as possible and this was the first step I could think of.  If you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer them and I thank those of you who actually took the time to read this."

let me apologize right away this isn't in French, but I don't yet feel confident enough to write a whole thread in it. I have given r/French a visit though and will now start improving my skills in this wonderful language.

I am a 21 year old law student and might, this all depends on if my application gets accepted, take n semester abroad in Paris from Feb-July 2014. I will be going with my girlfriend, who is a design student and who will do an internship in Paris in that period of time.


**My main question is about accomodation:**

Our budget will be around 1600€ max.

For now, I have looked on [airbnb](http://www.airbnb.at) and [nyhabitat](http://www.nyhabitat.com/de/) and have found some quite nice flats. Right away, are there any better alternatives to those 2 sites?

So, my (maybe-to-be) university is in the 7ème arrondissement in Paris.

Would you recommend renting an appartment close to or even in the 7ème or are we good with renting a place a bit more far away? I know from my own experiences that public transport is amazing so I suppose that even in the districts around I can reach the 7ème in like 20-35 minutes.

Would you recommend any certain districts for young people like us? We are not necessarily party-enthustiastic but we sure appreciate being in a nice arrondissement with open-minded, young folks, not too expensive restaurants to eat and maybe some good movie theatres or other cultural amenities close. Also, we would love to be quite central.

Also, are there any places you strictly wouldn't recommend? I think every city has places like this (either too far away or too fucked up), which you wouldn't recommend to others. What are the districts we should stay away from? Oh and please don't get me wrong, if that sounded superficial to you. I know that every arrondissement probably has its good and bad sides but I guess some are just more recommendable than the others.

Merci beaucoup for your help, it is very much appreciated!


**UPDATE:**

Thanks for all the feedback so far! 

Btw, what do you guys think of **Montmartre**? Would it be a good place to live?

Also, I have found an offer (quite expensive tho) for the area around [Rue de Babylone](http://goo.gl/maps/CzW2E), which would be very convenient in terms of the commute to SciPo. But what about the neighbourhood? It doesn't seem too lively, does it? But the walking distance to SciPo is quite tempting...

Another catch I made is flat near [Alesia](http://goo.gl/maps/cy3gO), which very conveniently lies on Metro line 4. Is the neighboorhood fine there as well? (It sure seems so from Google Street View and various internet sites).

I found one more: it's in Oberkampf and has a ~40 commute so SciPo, so not ideal. How is Oberkampf though? Any experiences?"

I have been an intern for a couple of engineering places so I have experience working with the QA (quality assurance) department. During my internships I did design and manufacturing type of work. 

The uncertainty of not having something after I graduate is killing me so im not sure if I should just accept this offer. What do you guys think? This position would be in Los Angeles and I would not need to move. 

Edit: See the thing is this isnt were I see myself really. I want to be on the design part of the job not quality. Im just worried that if I take this job and work there for about a year or what not that when I try to find other employment it will be doing the same thing. I guess you can put it as I dont want to be type cast or work cast haha. I mean how would you go from a quality engineering position to a design engineering position?"

Is showing the dedication to crim law more valuable than the $15/hour position?

Factors to consider:
The county attorney's office said they typically only hire prosecutors who were past interns. In my eyes, it would be a huge advantage for me to be able to show 3 summers with the same position. 

If the smarter thing is to go with the public interest position, will I burn any bridges with the county attorney's office who offered me an internship? I'd hate to be screwed down the line by backing out.

I'm barely top half. My stats aren't great. I have no idea how I snagged a paid position. (These were the only two interviews I went on.)

1dn1s2,3,2013-05-03,2nd Bachelor's vs. Potential job offer?,IcyRadish,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1dn1s2/2nd_bachelors_vs_potential_job_offer/,"So I just got out of a job interview for an entry-level Software Developer position that seems like it would be a great fit for me (I love the working environment, the people, the hours are flexible, I feel like I could learn and grow a lot from working there) except for one big catch -- since it is a consulting type position where I would potentially have to fly out and work with clients on-site for weeks at a time, it conflicts with my previous plans of going back to school for a BS in CS.

Some background on me: Previous BA in Biological Sciences at a prestigious almost-Ivy school. Realized after graduation that what I really want to do is be a programmer, instead. Took a bunch of CS classes at the local community college and was planning on transferring to the state university (it has a pretty highly regarded CS department) this upcoming fall to pursue a post-bacc BS in CS. 

Tentative plan was to graduate by 2015 (with work/internships on the side), then potentially pursue an MA in HCI (looking at CMU's program), then move out to a location I'd like to live for the long-term (Bay Area, maybe) and settle down (by the time I finish all that I'll be in my late 20's... I'd like to start having children by my early 30's).

Now here is my big question - job or degree? I have no previous job or internship experience in the CS field and I had been hoping that being in a respected CS undergrad program would afford me greater opportunities to get my foot into the door, but if there's already a potential job that seems promising, do I still need it?

I know that not all companies care if you have the degree as long as you can code, but I've also read that that in many cases you need to get past the HR first before you meet the people that determine whether or not you can code? I'd rather have that security already there in place and get my degree when I'm still relatively young, than come to regret not having a degree and going back for it when I am much older. At the same time, from reading this subreddit, it seems that work experience is super-valuable as well, and I don't know if I'd come to regret passing up this opportunity to work at this growing company where I'd get to wear a lot of hats and learn a ton of things I can't learn in the classroom.

Unfortunately the university doesn't offer nighttime or online classes. There was always the option of a Master's (since I already have a BA) but even with evening classes I doubt they'd let me disappear for weeks at a time. The only other alternative I can think of is online classes - I've been considering the BS at UMUC (I'm also a Maryland resident) and that seems feasible, except I'm worried about whether getting an online degree from there would be a positive or negative on my resume? And what the quality of their education is? Does anyone have any experience with their program? Would places like Google/Microsoft bother being interested in me with an online degree? Also, would it affect my chances of getting into a top grad school?

Apologies for the wall of text, and any answers to my questions or extra perspectives would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much!

**TL;DR: Currently trying to change career paths, decent background knowledge but no work experience. Potential developer job (that requires travel) incompatible with my plan to get a BS (2nd degree) in CS at a decently-ranked school starting this fall. What should I do? And would an online BS in CS at a lesser-known school be an advisable alternative?**"

I got ""promoted"" and I'm not sure how to tackle this.",Tossawench,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1dmvxl/ca_salary_renegotiation_advice_i_got_promoted_and/,"I hope this is the right place- the /r/jobs and /r/work subs seem more packed with finding work and less with working and salaries, and earning a salary seems to be part of personal 

Right now I make a bit shy of 30K before taxes. I'm a rare blessed little ducky with no student debts for my BA, so this is more about acquiring money so I can save it than getting out of debts. In another month my boss has scheduled a meeting to discuss a raise while being non-committal about ""good things are coming your way"", etc...

I graduated from a well ranked university, and have about a year of work experience + summer work. I did a lot of phone work (sales, collections, surveys), a marketing internship, and my job immediately after graduation was a supervisor at a marketing research firm. I also did freelance writing for minimal amounts of cash, which all came together into my current role.

After a grim summer of unemployment, I took an anyjob to get positive cash flow. I was hired to do ""Data Entry"" for a small web marketing firm, basically everything from posting SEO blogs and link building to occasionally doing the manual updates of websites via a CMS. The starting wage was $13 with a raise to $14 an hour after my three month probation period.

Within about a month they had me creating website content and so forth. Gradually I stopped doing the data entry all together- by the time I'd done three months I'd moved into doing writing exclusively.

Then they decided to have me do a sales role too- cold calling prospects with soft selling- basically trying to get people to make an interview with someone higher up the chain. I'm actually pretty good at this, though mostly self-trained. Then the person who was my supervisor/editor quit and now I'm also managing their content production and writing, including allotting labour resources between our in house writer and a bunch of freelancers, with the promise of being in charge of more people in future. My boss wants all sorts of reports on productivity. I can do it... but $14 seems a little ah... low. Around here I could reasonably expect to make more as a halfway decent phone sales person. And in my case I have to design my own sales strategy, scripts, follow up emails, etc…

Negotiations/review is in June. I'm doing the work of about 2 people at the moment and will quit if there is no compensation increase, and not by a $1 extra an hour either. I don't know how much to ask for and given that my duties keep mutating, I’m honestly stumped about what to look for as far as salaries. I’m a copy writer/editor/sales/manager in a large Canadian municipality (Montreal). As much as I don’t want to sound like an entitled millennium brat, if I’m good enough to do all this extra work, it doesn’t matter that I have only a few years of cumulative work experience, I’m still apparently credible enough to do all these things. So what should I approach my boss with to renegotiate as far as compensation?

I feel like a crappy economy put me at a disadvantage, but I would like to actually make enough not to need to live on lentils just to have more than minimal savings- especially watching how often people get laid off!

Any advice on what to ask for? How to make my case? How do I figure out what I'm supposed to get?"

I'm a dual major in philosophy and rhetoric. ideally, I will receive enough funding from a graduate program to continue my education and get a Ph.d in the latter discipline.  However,  I am not going to bet the farm on that.  I was hoping r/finance could offer advice on how to develop my resume to possibly gain some form of  employment in finance after I graduate.

I know its going to require an entirely different set of knowledge, but I have a whole summer to study and I've found what I've learned so far not terribly difficult to pick up. Could anyone recommend decent introductory literature, as well as a few habits that could help me along the way? I do have a few outstanding concerns though:

How do I distinguish myself from a business student when applying for internships?  I have extensive experience in being contracted for academic research (been working for a phil/econ prof for a year and a half) but no office experience.  I am confident that if I can at least get my foot in the door,  I can make the case that I am intelligent and competent.  I view it as a matter of not having my resume put in the rejection pile.

Secondly,  I know like any industry, there are tiers of prestige amongst companies.  Intuition tells me I would have better luck applying to lesser known firms if I want to get interviewed.  Am I mistaken in thinking this?  I would imagine GS, MS, Citi, Moody's  all want the applicants who've been basically bred to write programs for Bloomberg one day.  I am not that person.  Should I try to develop just general professional and office experience before trying to move specifically to finance?

Lastly,  is this a lost cause?  Am I too deep into my education to be trying to get involved in finance?  I would like to think its not the case, but I could be wrong.  I view an internship as my golden ticket into an actual career in finance, as knowledge without experience is not desirable in any applicant.  I don't necessarily expect a paying position upon completing my undergraduate,  but having the work experience  is what will permit me to continue along that path and eventually find something.  I view now as the time to do this if I am ever going to but am unsure of both its feasibility and method of execution.  I will appreciate any advice anyone can offer,  even if its not what I hope to year."

We started off on the wrong foot and even though I feel like he totally trusts me now, I still have do things that make me look guilty, even though I am not.

The ""wrong foot"" I mentioned was that we first began our romance while I was exclusively seeing someone else. My SO at the time (24m) decided he had enough of our home state and was going to move across the country to pursue his dream job. I was sick of school, needed a break and there was an awesome internship I got in the same place. I took it and I followed him down there 3 months after he moved. We did not live together but continued the relationship almost through the whole 6 month period. My current SO and I met through mutual friends and my relationship with my ex was definitely near its natural end; he didn't enjoy having sex with me, I wasn't ready to move in/marry/have kids (he couldn't wait). However 19 year old me didn't have the guts or respect to end the relationship on my own, so I let the kiss from my current SO do it for me. Then, I made it very clear to my current SO that I was not ready for the kind of relationship he wanted. This was all in a 2 week period and current SO never brought up anything about a lasting connection. I told him I liked him a lot, loved spending time with him but we never had any talks of exclusivity or monogamy. He thought that was implied by our actions and level of intimacy, I did not. I returned home after the internship and I started playing the field, being mostly honest about my intentions and whereabouts. I never outright said I was seeing other people, but I never hid the fact I was hanging out with other guys... And he never asked or questioned it. Long story short, he was not on board and we stopped talking (my choice out of the options he gave me-- all or nothing) once he found out I wasn't being ""faithful"" because I basically came out and said that I was not ready for a long distance, monogamous relationship with a guy I only knew for a few months and only really started liking the last few weeks of the internship. He was very, very hurt.

3 months later of no communication I realized I had made a mistake and asked if we could take it slow, begin talking and building a friendship but did not (stupidly) address the monogamy issue. Since I fucked it up last time by kissing other dudes, I did not kiss anyone else. Apparently, he thought we were still ""doing our own thing"" and I saw a picture of him getting a NYE kiss on a social networking site. I flipped and realized, if it made me this upset, maybe we should see where things go, exclusively. He was so upset that he didn't know I wanted this from him, said it was all he ever wanted in the first place, and we became exclusive a little bit after that.

There were a lot of trust issues, he made me feel so terrible for that first few months. I basically cut off all ties to other males, any post on my wall or comment from another guy was an accusation. I would get comments from males, and he would flip. I almost couldn't even go out without spending hours reassuring him, etc. I had to get a second job during school because I needed some extra cash and he said, ""you better not get a slutty job""-- implying bartender, shot girl, etc. basically, no credit was given where credit was due. I agree, it was toxic for a little bit because I really didn't feel like I had even cheated on him because we weren't ""exclusive"". I see where he is coming from to a certain extent, but I still stand by the fact that I got WAY more shit than I deserved and the 2000 miles in between us really didn't help. Regardless, we continued to work on it from both sides.
Fast forward to now, We made it work, I am so glad we did and now have been able to move to the same city and after a year of that, moved in together. We are happy. So happy, we love each other to pieces and I really have no complaints.

Wow-- here is my issue now. I do things that make me look like a cheater. When I'm telling him I'm going out with friends, I stumble over words, I try to make the location sound ""acceptable"". I over explain things so he knows every single detail, which makes it sound unbelievable (don't liars have every little detail nailed down so it looks like it is an honest story?) I turn off my phone as soon as he walks into the room ( I do this because I think it is rude to stare at your phone when someone else is there to engage with you, but it looks like I'm hiding something) I tilt my phone so it looks like I'm hiding it, even when it is something completely mundane, like online banking. I do not accept friend requests, I ignore males completely (not that I flirt when he isn't around, but will speak to them like humans). I have a strong urge to delete any communication from male counterparts, regardless of content.

 He still occasionally talks to one girl he messed around with (I am under the impression it stopped before sex) and has plenty of female friend (totally respectful) that I am fine with. I am very easy going about that sort of thing, he is not and it is actually making -me- more untrusting and urging me to monitor him like used to monitor me... It's only fair, says my brain. I basically am so anxious he is going to find a reason to see me as unfaithful that it has made me into someone who looks unfaithful.

I realized they were still charging me a monthly fee despite not using their service at all. A lapse in my memory had it go beyond the trial period.

Two hours after I had unsubscribed I get an email from ""a real person"" that stated something to the tune of ""We noticed you cancelled your account. Since you've been using it quite recently we wanted to know why the cancellation?""

I had to laugh, it was probably a true email in 90% of the cases but in this case it had been about 3 months since I had even logged in. Since there was no evidence of usage when I logged in I knew it was an automated response timed to look like a caring customer rep.

I think it's important for anyone in business or industry to remember that we should approach automation carefully and not try to trick customers or users into believing a real person is serving them. It doesn't phase me in the least but some people might be upset if they realized a company was fibbing about a real person addressing their needs. No one wants to erode trust in an era where touchy subjects like automation already have the skepticism of some.

Close to 14th Street would be best.
1dmiej,23,2013-05-03,[UPDATE] [21/m] My girlfriend [20/f] (of 3.5 yrs.) and I are on the verge of breaking up and I have no support network to talk to.,redyellowblue5031,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dmiej/update_21m_my_girlfriend_20f_of_35_yrs_and_i_are/,"Link to original thread &gt; [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1d5jld/21m_my_girlfriend_20f_of_35_yrs_and_i_are_on_the/)

First I want to thank the whole community for your support; I didn't expect such a response and I really am grateful. You people are all awesome.

I have accepted the internship, and I need to start looking for an sublet. Me and my girlfriend had a rather large blowout when we finally talked that day last week when I first posted. We worked things out to a point where we are together right now. We both acknowledged that we both are not happy with how things have gone and ~~want~~ need change. 

We came to the conclusion that she needs me there for her no matter what, and I said I can't put up with any violence. We have been working from there. She came to a bike race that I had registered for that Sunday and was very supportive. We had no major fights this week. However, while talking about the internship (and currently) she isn't happy about it. For her it comes down to a matter of that for how much pain and difficulty our relationship has gone through, it's almost impossible to have me away that long and still want to continue forward. I believe the reasoning for her is that having your significant other move out and into a different apartment for a summer with different people is something that wouldn't be much of a struggle in a healthy relationship, but we don't fit that bill and so it's very difficult to be trusting of the future and she has (and so do I) many bad feelings that need to be resolved. 

Our relationship is far from good, or even stable I would say. I want to work it out with her though. I am also reconnected with my old psychologist. I presented my theories on many problems I have. Basically, I think I'm emotionally and psychologically underdeveloped from a lack of feedback from my parents. Let me put it this way, I had a mother and father, but no mom or dad. I had a roof, food, clothes. But I had no compassion or feedback. No ""I love you"", ""you're important to me"", never saw my parents kiss, hug, hold hands, say I love you, etc. *Ever*. This came to a climax when my father passed away unexpectedly (sort of) at 57 in 2010. I've been sort of a zombie since then and haven't figured all this out. 

How does any of that tie into the relationship, you might wonder? I think it does because I never got any approval from my dad in any fashion. Nothing felt good enough. I think that in a weird twisted way, I see my girlfriend as my father in that I seek her approval and part of the reason I react to problems in our relationship is because of how I see her, and I can't deal with the rejection that what I've done isn't good enough. 

So now I'm here. All of your comments really forced me to think hard about what's important to me and what I want. I'm still figuring all of that out. This is what I have so far. I know I need professional help to get through my past issues so I can be a functional person who doesn't break down at the first sign of rejection/disapproval. I'm not sure how to fix my relationship exactly, but I know I want us both to be happy. 

Thank you. 

tl:dr

I posted about me and my girlfriend having serious issues last week, and I needed a support group. I got that support from this (awesome) community. I have since been to my old psychologist, accepted my internship and am still together with my girlfriend. I have some moderate psychological issues to sort through and still would love any advice, thoughts, comments on the situation. Lastly, Thank you for reading this, my old post and providing any feedback; I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. "

Anyone have a good grasp on it who can spare a few minutes?",NewLifeInAustralia,australia,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1dmhz6/recent_foreign_medical_grad_looking_to_move_to/,"My husband and I fell in love with Australia on our many visits (and have more friends there then where we live now) and we would like to relocate. I recently graduated medical school and want to practice rural family medicine once there. Based on the information from the Australian Medical Council website, I am eligible for AMC certificate under standard pathway and would eligible for a provisional registration with the Medical Board of Australia. I think it would then be necessary for me to complete a 12 month approved intern program or other supervised training that is 12 month in duration after the successful completion of which I would be eligible for general registration, but the whole thing seems in flux and I would like some clarification before we start getting our hopes up or spending a lot of money.

1.	The information from the Medical Board of Australia indicates that “proof of internship or comparable” is necessary. I have not been able to determine if this refers to the 12 month intern program they require or the same from somewhere else.

2.	It seems, from the reading I have done, that there are many underserved rural areas that are in need to physicians. Do these areas have programs/hospitals with approved internships or the medicine/surgery/ER facilities required for the supervised year?

3.	Is there a centralized place that lists all of the available approved internship spots?

4.	Is there a service that can help navigate the registration/employment/internship/immigration systems?

We are deeply appreciative of anyone who can help us out. Most of the stuff we can find online is either outdated or contradictory. We just want to follow the rules and do our part, but really have no idea if we're even on the right track.

Thank you!"

1dm10i,8,2013-05-03,Is this an insane plan?,padawanprogrammer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1dm10i/is_this_an_insane_plan/,"**TLDR: Quitting my PhD and moving to San Francisco to follow my dream of coding professionally.  Any advice for transitioning from science?**

Greetings reddit.  I'm about to ""master out"" of my PhD program (read: quit) in a non-CS science at a top 5 US research university.  My undergrad degree was in the same non-CS science at another top university.  My grades and science work so far have been okay, but nothing to write home about.  No internships or anything; until now, it's been science all the way.  I'm 26 years old, dating but unmarried; no house or car.  I want to quit because I think the educational model and career path of academia are seriously fucked up and going the way of the dinosaur.

I've done a significant amount of scripting (mostly Python, some MATLAB--when forced--and shell)  for my research over the past ~4 years, and for a while now I've known that I enjoy the programming a lot more than the science.  Even though I've been coding for a long time, most of my code so far has been ad hoc hacks that get stuff done but aren't great conversation starters.  That said, I've done enough and read enough of the python docs that I consider myself at an ""upper intermediate"" level of fluency with Python, but to be honest it's hard to self-assess these things.  I solved about 30 Project Euler problems, if you think that might be somehow relevant.

I've been auditing a couple CS classes this semester, but honestly the CS dept here is so theoretical and mathy that it doesn't seem like it will be that helpful for getting a job.  I've learned more about algorithms from refactoring and profiling my project euler solutions than I have in the class I've sat in on.

So, I need to make a serious career jump without falling into the abyss.  Does this sound like a stupid plan?

1. Take my masters degree in June.  Withdraw from the PhD and cease receiving my monthly stipend.

2. Summer: Self-fund from savings my own ""summer of code"" to put together a couple small to medium-sized learning projects in a ""hot"" language (ruby?).  Put everything on github.  Also try to make a few patches on open source projects I like.  Attend local hackathons and developer meetups; learn as much as possible and talk to people about what they look for in junior hires.

3. Fall: Leave behind my girlfriend-subsidized living arrangements and move to the Bay Area.  I got into one of those developer bootcamp thingies in SF for a fall session.  I don't buy into the hype that they can take total noobs and turn them into good coders in few months, but I know how produce useable code already and the idea of learning new technologies, languages, and frameworks doesn't intimidate me; I'm mostly interested in the program because I think it will be motivational to surround myself with others trying to make similar transitions while also helping me learn about how to work on code with other people.  The program also has an arranged mass interview day with companies, which sounds nice.  But is it worth the money?  As an alternative to a paid bootcamp, would I be just as well off meeting and working with people full-time at a coworking space like Hacker Dojo? ... keeping that up until a job materializes through networking and saving myself the (significant!) tuition of a web dev bootcamp?

4. Fall--Winter: Regardless of whether I complete the bootcamp program, network like crazy.  Keep working on personal projects and applying for jobs.

Between personal savings, parental assistance, credit cards, and mooching off friends I'm pretty sure I can afford to spend the next 6 months or so reprogramming myself as a dev.  

So the key questions are:

1. **Does this sound like a story with a happy ending?**

2. In your opinion, **would a coding bootcamp be worth the money compared with alternative ways of learning and connecting with people?**

3. Besides things I have mentioned, **what can I do in the next sixth months to make myself a better candidate?**  Must-read books or must-have skills?

and bonus question...

4. What is the best thing for an aspiring dev to put on their business cards?  Job title? "

I quit smoking for 40 days in preparation for my drug test last summer. It was brutal, but I was happy to get it over with. My ideal plan was to buy some buds, roll up a nice blunt, and smoke it on the ride home from the test. However, being home for the summer, none of the dealers I knew from high school were around, so sadly I couldn't find any.

Before the test, I wanted to make sure that I passed, so I drank a good deal of water before to ensure some clear-looking piss. Everything at the testing center went smoothly, but I was still upset that I was dry. And I stayed dry for 3 days. Just as I got a hold of someone, I received an email from the testing center saying that my urine was too diluted to get a good sample, and that I had to retake the test. 

Thank god for bad pot dealers. If everything had gone according to plan, I would've had it in my system for the retest, and my internship would've gone down the drain. So here's what I have to say to you:

MAKE SURE YOU RECEIVE CONFIRMATION THAT YOU PASSED BEFORE YOU TOKE AGAIN. I got lucky, but not everyone else will be. Be smart, be safe, and don't let the wonderful herb ruin your future. Toke on, my friends. "

Also Elmer Bernstein, Danny Elfman, Bernard Herrmann and Ennio Morricone to name just a few.  Oh, and Basil Poledouris.
[Seriously no mention of Human Target?  I still think the show was canceled because they replaced the theme.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r9p5e?context=5)|I loved that score.  Every once in a while I bring it up on my iPod just to remember how much it kicked ass. I am very honored to have worked on that show for a season.  :)
[What is your most favorite piece you have scored? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4ez8?context=5)|Wow, I don't think I could ever pick.  Most composers will always tell you that their favorite piece of music is the one they're working on right now.  That applies for me I think. 
[**MILD BSG SPOILERS**  Hey Bear, I'm a little late, hope you get around to answering this but I was wondering where you got the inspiration for using All along the watchtower for the cylon song. Was it the plan all along to use 1123 6536 5321 as the coordinates, or did that come up organically?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r6ev4?context=5)|Ironically, very little of all that was planned from the beginning.  No one knew when I arranged that song in Season 3 that it would be required to generate coordinates in Season 4.  Perhaps I was guided by the lords of kobol?  Because the melody I wrote to represent the final five and introduced in that arrangement happened to have exactly the number of digits necessary to create the coordinates.  Spooky...
[Will they ever release the BSG score on Spotify? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r7ub1?context=5)|Hopefully.  We're working on it.

[Hey, Bear! Thanks for doing this AMA. Your scores are absolutely brilliant in every way.  2\) If you could, would you score for Ron Moore again ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4r6p?context=5)|That was a blast.  My brother's voice was just perfect for that song and he has since been a featured singer, with his own original music, on ""Caprica"" and now ""Defiance.""  you guys will hear one of his songs featured in a big way in a few episodes from now.
[Thanks for responding Bear. I have a 7 year old who's trying to learn ""Kara Remembers"". When we both first heard it, we fell in love with it instantly. Thanks for being awesome Bear. Your music truly gives the stories more soul.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5ams?context=5)|Wow!  That's very impressive.  I imagine your 7 year old is playing the upper part right?  :)
[How do you generally become involved in a project? Do the producers generally seek you out or is there some kind of auditioning process? Thanks :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4vad?context=5)|All of the above.  Sometimes I'm brought in very early and I'm the top of the list.  Other times, I'm asked to submit some music that might be similar to what they're looking for since producers are casting a wider net. It varies from project to project.  Other times, as was the case with the ""Angry Video Game Nerd Movie"" I reached out to the filmmakers and said I wanted to work with them right from the get go.
[Can I just say that I love your wife's blog?  (Yours too.  But yours is more educational while her Florence entries had me on the floor laughing.\)  You two are awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r56bh?context=5)|I know!

[If somehow Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles was to go back into production (or a sequel of some sort, a movie, webisodes, something\) - would you be willing to go back to composing music for that series?

I truly miss writing music for that show.   I still have so many variations of Sarah's Theme.  if I had the time, I'd just produce a ""Sarah Connor Season 3 Album"" by itself!

I use Digital Performer, Pro Tools, Sibelius as primary software.
[3\) Have you jammed with Zimmer, Newton-Howard,  Williams, Jablonsky, any of those guys?  If not, what kind of project would it take to make it so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5u9b?context=5)|Haven't jammed with those guys. 
[Thank you very much for doing this AMA. I was wondering what show that you worked on has influence you and by extension your music, the most? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5ct8?context=5)|Hard to say.  Every project changes me.  Every piece of music I write changes me just a bit.  I think, obviously, that ""BSG"" had a profound impact on me.  Not just creatively, but professionally.  It transitioned me from being an excited amateur to a young professional.  That was amazing.
[If you had to name one inspiration over all others, could you? Who would it be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4fot?context=5)|This is extremely difficult.  But, I might pick Jerry Goldsmith.

You've got a big uphill battle in front of you.  But, its all worth it when you FINISH writing music.  That's a wonderful feeling.
[Hi, what is your favorite wake up music? And could you compose one for us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4o78?context=5)|I'll work on something right now.  How about a Concerto for Chainsaw?  I imagine that would wake you up in the morning.  :)
[Hey Bear, long time fan here. Loved the BSG stuff and the Sarah Connor scores were brilliant!  Anyway my question is would there be any chance you'd be willing to compose for the new Star Wars franchise?  Also, how did you become such an amazingly brilliant composer? What got you started and where did you go from there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5gvt?context=5)|I think the composer should be John Williams for as long as he is willing and able.
[Bear! I am a composer in Los Angeles, trying to establish myself in the industry, and using the tools available to young up and comers, for me especially, are the MIDI string instruments such as Action Strings for Logic Pro.  What are your thoughts on composers these days using MIDI instruments, specifically for strings and orchestral compositions?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r52g1?context=5)|Virtual instruments are a great way to communicate your ideas.  But, they're a means, not the ends.  I think spending too much time and energy dealing with them is counterproductive and prevents you from developing your own unique sound.
[Hi Bear! Maybe a naive question but what's the process for creating a score? Do the producers/directors come to you and say ""write us some music for a space show"" and let you run with it, or is there a lot of back and forth during the creation process? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r8kn9?context=5)|There's always a varying degree of back and forth.  And its always best when you're collaborating with people who have either the vision to express their desires, or the trust to let you move forward with yours.  Typically, most projects are somewhere between.  But, I rely on producers' input to realize my own visions.  Working with David S. Goyer on ""Da Vinci's Demons"" was one of those rare situations where getting notes always improved the cues.  He was able to make suggestions, not in musical terms, but in emotional ones, that resulted in better music.  That's a very fun situation!
[Hi Bear. I live in Bellingham. Some of my friends went to school with you n' stuff.  My question: do you ever come back to the 'Ham? And if so, would you like to jam along with my cohorts in the totally un-famous gamelan band Monkey Puzzle Orchestra? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5dvo?context=5)|An un-famous gamelan band called ""Monkey Puzzle Orchestra""??  You guys need an accordion player.  Count me in!

The Governor obviously created a new layer for the show, and as such, he needed a new kind of music.
[Is there a ""Go-to-set"" of scare or even zombie sounds in the composing industry? When my friends and I want to imply that something dangerous is is looming we immitate the shrieking violin sounds.  Did you add ""new"" ingredients to your personal set, or did you rather rearrange ideas and sounds you had before for the TWD dish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5hyx?context=5)|There are tons of ""go-to"" scary sounds in film scoring.  Those were the first things we eliminated when Frank Darabont and I started talking about the score for the show.  I go out of my way to not fall back on those old tropes, because we're so familiar with them.  They're not effecetive anymore.
[Heard you directed a music video for Young Beautiful in a Hurry that's coming out soon? What are you thoughts on directing vs. composing? Are there more videos in the works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5dew?context=5)|Indeed I did!  We're doing the video release party on May 11th in Los Angeles at Molly Malone's.  Details here: [Link to youngbeautifulinahurry.com](http://youngbeautifulinahurry.com/dont-stop-me-now) If you miss the show, we'll be posting the video online shortly thereafter.  There are some awesome cameos in there too, including BSG's Aaron Douglas!  We're working on a whole new set of videos to come out later this year.  And I'm collaborating with the band on a song for a new timelaps video from Randy Halverson, for whom I wrote ""Temporal Distortion"" last year.  So, a lot of stuff is in the works!

It was a tough one!  I played all summer doing our BSG Orchestra tour and I don't think I ever managed to get it perfect.  So, just go for it!  Send it to me :)

But, I don't wish I wrote them.  Because then I wouldn't be able to simply listen and enjoy them!
[Do you choose which songs are used on the show? if so, what is your process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r9tf1?context=5)|Sometimes, but rarely.  that's almost never the job of a composer.  In the case of ""BSG,"" ""Caprica"" and occasionally ""Defiance"" I am heavily involved.  In the case of ""Trauma,"" ""The Walking Dead"" and other episodes of ""Defiance,"" I have nothing to do with the selection of songs whatsoever.
[Hey Bear, congrats on your work. I'm a happy man having the three last BSG albums signed by you (I'd love to have had the rest as well :(\).  Anyhow, quick question, have you written the opening credits theme of Defiance? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5b3p?context=5)|Yup.

I enjoyed music.  I loved the movies.  Suddenly realizzing that these two art forms met somewhere, that was very exciting.  I was probably about five years old and I never looked back.
[Hi Bear, BIG fan and thanks for doing this AMA!  I do some indie film and docu scoring from time to time, and I was wondering what do you do when you really feel like a piece needs some more work but there's a limited budget?  Do you go the extra mile ""on the house"", do you ask for more budget, or do you just let it go regardless of how you feel about the piece?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5jsu?context=5)|I never let something go if it doesn't live up to my standards.  If a project doesn't have a big budget, I tailor my music to whatever they can afford.  But, you should never allow yourself to get in a position where you write music intended for a big budget and then, by surprise, end up without one.  Sometimes horrible things happen, its true, but you should always do your best to know what they have to work with and tailor your creativity to the constraints.  
[Can you compare the music between the ""barn scene"" in WD season 2 vs. ""The Killer Within"" from season 3? Both were super emotional scenes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4qij?context=5)|NO SPOILERS, but they were both immensely challenging.  ""Killer Within"" took me a week.  Not to score the whole episode... just that one scene.  And it really depressed me.  I had trouble sleeping.  It was not fun.  Totally worthwhile in the end, but the experience was very unpleasant.
[Are there any composers you hope to collaborate with on future projects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4u12?context=5)|Yes, actually.  We're looking for the right project to come along. ;)

So, I'm a fan of all the projects I've scored. To me, this is a passion, not just a job.  I've been VERY fortunate to find myself in that position.
[""Violence and Variations"" from season 3 of BSG is my all-time favorite piece of music ever. Did you ever think during the beginning of the show that you'd get to do such an epic piece as that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r62jv?context=5)|Not at all! At the beginning of the show, I was told there would be no themes and no orchestra ever! It was just minimal percussion and a few ethnic soloists.  Slowly, during season 1, that expanded to include a small string orchestra.  That group just got bigger and bigger until we had a full orchestra doing big sweeping themes at the end.  It was a natural evolution.

(I love your music so much!!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4me5?context=5)|Not really.  When I'm working on ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Eureka"" its easy for them to sound different. Ditto for ""Da Vinci's Demons"" and ""Walking Dead.""  I take on projects that allow me to explore new sounds. Doing all the Renaissance music in ""Da Vinci's Demons"" was a new experience for me.

If I just sit still for a minute, I'll start hearing patterns in traffic, birds, wind.  Anything.  I think my mind is always looking for interesting sounds that can be ordered and given meaning.  I wish I could shut it off sometimes, to be honest.

[Hi Bear! Love your work! Kat's Sacrifice and All Along The Watchtower are some of my favorite tracks! Two questions.  Why not release digital? At least from a direct website if not through stores like iTunes and Amazon MP3? I believe the albums can be restricted to require the purchase of the full album.  Some of the most amazing work is starting to turn up in video games. Austin Wintory for Journey as an example. Would you ever consider working on an indie game if it had a real concept and story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9rk4dj?context=5)|Check out my new label Sparks &amp; Shadows.

As for indie games, I'm way into that.  I already scored and released an album for MOONBREAKERS for my pal Ed Byrne.  I'm also already working on the unofficial sequel to ECCO THE DOLPHIN, called THE BIG BLUE, collaborating with composer Spencer Nilsen and game designer Ed Annunziata. Here's our kickstarter!

However, I'm very picky about using live instruments in the final product.  You'll never hear fake strings or fake winds and brass in my score.

Looking forward to your Steampunk webseries!  ;) I definitely played some Prince tune on accordion at that wedding.  Honestly, I don't know why I quit playing accordion at weddings.  I should keep it up.  I could probably get some decent gigs! 
[Whatever happened to Knights of Badassdom? It seems to have completely vanished off the radar.  If the film doesn't end up getting released, do you think there's a possibility that you can get permission to release the soundtrack through your record label?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r5nwm?context=5)|Your guess is as good as mine. ""Knights of Badassom"" is an awesome movie, with a fantastic cast. And I dare say, a fantastic score. I had an incredible time scoring it and I'm a little confused as to why it didn't come out a year ago.  I'm hopeful that the right thing will be done and you'll get the chance to see the film and hear my epic score one of these days...
[Hello Mr. Mcreary, first off, fantastic job on the Walking Dead! That soundtrack never fails to give me chills.  I have a few questions,  What is your favorite peice you've ever composed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r62zk?context=5)|Being a composer is all I've ever wanted to do.  There really was nothing else for me.  When I was five, film music first caught my ear and I was pretty trapped from that point onward.  Luckily for me, I managed to carve out a living.  Because there was no back up plan!
[With Defiance (love the game soundtrack and the TV series so far\), it seems like you have a lot of control over the music. Do you choose the cool not-well-known covers of popular songs at the end of the last couple of episodes? Also, can we expect some moderation with those - I think having one at the end of every single episode would be bit too much.  And what is it like not only creating brand new songs, but songs made by aliens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r4w4i?context=5)|I have control over SOME of the songs.  The Nirvana cover I had nothing to do with for example.  But, the cover of ""Ooh Child"" this week was produced by me, and sung by Raya Yarbrough with whom I frequently collaborate.  As the episodes progress, you'll hear about half the episodes end with a needledrop pop song and half end with a score or song cue that I did. And doing the alien band songs is amazing.  What a challenge!  I have to design alien sounds for instruments AND teach the singers to sing in these alien languages designed by David J. Peterson.  It's a blast!
[Well, from one creative guy to another, do ideas just 'pop into your head'? Or is it more methodical, a evolution stemming from a seed of a thought, like the distant pinprick of a star actually being the light of a supernova flaring up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r8rsi?context=5)|Ideas almost never pop in there (like the Stay Puft marshmallow man!).  I get basic shapes or intrumentation ideas in my head, but I feel more like a sculptor than a painter. I have to chisel away at the marble for hours before I start getting to the details.
[Hi Bear! I love the music in Da Vinci's Demons. What's your favorite thing about composing the score for this show in particular? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r543m?context=5)|""Da Vinci's Demons"" is an amazing opportunity.  Not only do I get to write lush, lyrical melodies and produce the score with a full orchestra, but I also get to explore Renaissance instrumentation and music.  This is something I ignored in school and now I've gone back and done a lot of research.  So, the score has made me a better composer and at the same time, pushed me to write what I think might be my best music yet.
[I read somewhere that in the episode of BSG where Kara imagines her father playing the piano in the bar that they based the character on you.  Can you speak to that? The actor they used does seem to resemble you in photos. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dkb2t/i_am_bear_mccreary_composer_for_da_vincis_demons/c9r66ud?context=5)|You know, the character was based in part on me.  I had long talks with the writers as they were coming up with his dialog.  They even auditioned me for the role!  Except it turns out I can't act at all.  :)  The guy who plays the role did an amazing job, and I was there on set to help the piano performances come together.

1dlokh,1,2013-05-03,I [F21] am irrationally jealous of my boyfriend [M21]'s ex-girlfriend and want to stop feeling like this.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dlokh/i_f21_am_irrationally_jealous_of_my_boyfriend/,"How can I keep myself from getting irrationally jealous of my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend?

In a nutshell, my reasons for feeling this way are:

1. I have seen her facebook pictures and she is objectively more attractive than me (very slim, very cute, seems to have many friends)

2. I know that the only reason he and she broke up was because of long distance after high school, so he still cares for her. In a parallel universe, they could be perfect for each other.

3. She shares interests with him that I don't: she's a great singer, actress and performer. He really likes musicals and acts in our college plays.

4. Her parents are really accomplished in the academic world and have helped my boyfriend find internships, while he doesn't really have a relationship with my parents (because they disapprove of me dating a white guy).

I have been dating him for almost 2 years. We are both juniors in college, so his ex and him haven't dated in a very long time. He is a great boyfriend and seems to care for me, but I can't help but think that he has downgraded from his last girlfriend.

Before he and I started dating, he and I were very close friends and he told me intimate details about his ex during that time. This was freshman year, they had broken up due to long distance, and he still had very strong feelings for her. I know details about many aspects of their relationship-- when they first had sex, what her parents do, her interests, why he loved her so much, etc. 
After he realized that he couldn't be with her, he went through an angsty period, and around January of freshman year, he stopped talking about her as much because she had started dating someone new. By this time I had feelings for him. In February 2011 we started dating each other.

For example, I know that because she was a virgin and he respected her, he waited a long time to have sex with her and made sure she felt comfortable (they did so after 6 months of dating). With me, from basically day 1, he has been very touchy-feely and continually pressured me to have sex with him (I was also a virgin). We didn't have sex until 6 months into our relationship but I would constantly have to turn him down/ ask him to please wait until I'm ready. We have since talked about his behavior during the beginning of our relationship and he has apologized. He now always makes sure that I am comfortable about the physical things that we do.

I have not always been so insecure, but sophomore year was a difficult year academically and socially for me. I had a difficult time with classes (we go to a really hard tech school) and even socially, I started becoming jealous of more attractive close friends. I never voiced these insecurities. I think beforehand, I always identified myself as the 'smart girl' but in college, everyone seemed incredibly intelligent. So my new role for myself became 'pretty girl' and when that image (to me) was shattered as I gained weight sophomore year, I started having very low self-esteem.

Junior year has been much better academically. I've been mentally stable and happy, until about a month ago. About a month ago, I began feeling similar emotions of insecurity. I'm not sure what sparked this, since I've been exercising, getting fit, doing well in classes, and enjoying time with my friends. 

I have been seeing a therapist about these feelings, and he suggests that I talk to my boyfriend about how I'm feeling. So today, I admitted that I am seeing a therapist about insecurities regarding his ex-girlfriends. My boyfriend said that luckily he loves only me, but he's glad I told him about how I'm feeling. I didn't mention any of the reasons WHY exactly I felt insecure. 

Is this conversation over? I know this is something I should deal with, considering he's not at fault and I am simply battling with my own emotional problems. But what do I do? My therapist wants me to talk to him more, but I don't know how to bring it up again. My boyfriend didn't really seem to want to talk about it (he quickly switched the conversation topic to 3d printers).

He never compliments academic accomplishments nor my physical appearance, but to solve this problem, I'm not sure if seeking validation from him is the healthiest approach. I just want to at least hear him say that he loves me more than he has ever loved her. Is this wrong and unrealistic? 

TLDR: I keep comparing myself to my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend and can't help but think that she was a better 'catch' than me. How do I block out these feelings?"

From the time I got home from my internship at around 6:30, up until now, I have been going out of my mind. I feel like I am going to go mad. I want to have sex so bad I feel like I'm dying by holding this in. 

I have blue balls, and all I can think about is sex. I'm hurting I needed to vent this. I really don't know what to do, I think I'm going to go for a walk now."

We've been dating for 16 months, and have been having protected sex that entire span. We always use condoms, but not birth control. Something must've went wrong last month, because last Thursday (after realizing she was a week late) we got a pregnancy test that confirmed she was pregnant.

Regardless of how unlikely this all is, neither one of us is ready to be parents, are still knee deep in our college education, and don't have nearly enough money between the two of us. I advocated for an abortion, but she is too scared of it and her family would literally disown her if they found out she got one. We're probably going the adoption route.

Pretty much her entire family already knows, but I haven't told anyone in mine yet. I'm absolutely terrified to tell them. I feel like they will never look at me the same. To make things worse, she has an internship for most of the summer in the town where we go to school and is living there, while I have mine in my hometown about 2 hours away. We won't be able to see each other a lot this summer, and she will be by herself over where she lives (her roommates have moved out). I feel unbelievably guilty about not being there for her this summer, even though she repeatedly has told me she'll be ok.

What should I do? How do I tell my parents? They're coming to pick me up from school tomorrow morning to take me home for the summer. My head is literally spinning right now. I'm not ready for this at all:/

tl;dr My girlfriend is pregnant and we aren't ready to be parents. I have no idea how to tell my parents about it all.

**UPDATE:** Sorry for the lack of responses the past couple days, I've been going through a lot. I told my mother last night. She was shocked at first and seems a tad overwhelmed but after talking about it for a while and putting my GF on the phone, she calmed down very quickly. We're both looking at it all as rationally as possible. She is very supportive, but at the same time wants to make sure that my and my GF have multiple plans in place for this. 

My dad's been super stressed recently doing work-related stuff, so I'm holding off on telling him for a couple of days, when he'll be in a better state of mind to handle news like this. My mom thinks it's a good idea too. Hopefully he will take it as well as she has. It's a little weird knowing it's out there now, but my mom isn't treating me any different than before. She said she didn't want me too feel overwhelmed right away, and it's actually really comforting. 

My girlfriend and I are still pretty scared about the upcoming months, but I think we'll be able to get through it. Now the hope is to find the right adoption family. Thanks again for your suggestions and support. I really appreciated it.

*the case and PSU were in a combo so I arbitrarily split the total price.


When I'm at my apartment at school, this will be my workstation and battlestation.  I'll be playing games like StarCraft 2, Metro 2033, Crysis, etc. and doing work in NX/SolidWorks as well as Illustrator and Photoshop.  I am on a tight budget though, so please keep build suggestions under $700.  

My main concerns are:

* Money. I *am* splurging a little while on my internship, but I would definitely like to save as much as possible while building a good value machine.
* Compatibility.  I've tried to do my research for this, so I feel like the parts are all pretty good choices for what I'd like to do.  I did notice the PCPartPicker alert about how my mobo has USB 3.0 headers for a case with USB 2.0 front panel ports, but from some Googling, it seemed like it would be okay.  Of course, I'll take any help I can get.
* Timing.  I started buying these parts over time to take advantage of sales, and I'm assuming that the next big sales will come around for Memorial Day weekend.  My plan is to buy the rest of the components at around that time, unless I can get them on sale before that.

Edit:  Forgot to mention that I am not going to immediately overclock, but would like to have the option in the future.  Please critique this build and help me figure out what I could do better!

Thanks in advance, BaPC!"
1dlh26,0,2013-05-02,What if Riot included things like public speaking courses that the LCS players could take?,Botulism19,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1dlh26/what_if_riot_included_things_like_public_speaking/,"It seems like Riot would have the resources to do something like this.  I thought about this after watching a lot of interviews with pro players (especially some from the newer teams) who have very insightful things to say, but a lot of times don't really have the training to know what is important when interacting with interviewers and fans.  This would improve the quality of a lot of interviews done by not only Riot, but 3rd party folks who are working to build up an interview base with these pro players; something that would also reflect well on the e-sport as a whole to have a more professional appearance.

Another great reason why this would be a worthwhile program for Riot to implement is that normally people may have had the option to take courses like this in college or in certain career paths / internships, but a lot of these LCS players are forgoing college in order to pursue this.  Even if someone was interested in improving their public speaking and appearance, it would be difficult to try and do this outside of the scene, since so much time is dedicated to trvel, practice, and playing.  However, if Riot was running this, they would be able to weave things in and out of this e-sports's rough schedule.

Thoughts?"

1dlchk,29,2013-05-02,Drug Test Revenge,sgtbig21,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1dlchk/drug_test_revenge/,"**Background:**
After spending the last semester and a decent portion of this semester trying to find an internship, I finally found one.  Its with a large financial services company and they require you to pass a drug test before being officially on-boarded into the company.  No big deal, I've taken these tests before and I don't do any drugs.

However, I have horrible allergies, so bad that I went to an allergist when I was younger to get shots once a week for years.  Its been exceptionally bad this year and I've been taking advil cold and sinus ever 4 hours to try to cope with it.  This over the counter medication will show up as meth (I most definitely do not do meth) on some drug screenings though, and I have a lot of it in my system.  After talking to my on-boarding coordinator, I was told I could easily declare this before the drug test and it shouldn't be an issue.

**The offense:**
So I go to the facility to get tested, bring the box of advil I was taking and talk to the woman behind the desk who will be administering the test.  I ask if I can declare the drugs to which she responds ""There's no section for that on our forms, so tough shit.""  She continues to talk down to me and treat me like garbage while she prepares the test / explains the rules.  Then she leaves me in the bathroom with the empty piss cup.

**The Revenge:**
Having filled the cup to a reasonable level, I proceeded to piss all over the outside of the cup.  Holding the only two dry spots on the cup between my thumb and fore finger, I hand over the test with a smirk on my face.  She was clearly uncomfortable and in emotional pain despite the latex gloves.  A couple drops actually fell onto her shirt and clipboard.  

**TL;DR** Got treated like shit by the woman administering my urinalysis drug test, got my piss on her and her stuff.

I'll be working in the office of a US Congressman who was a co-author of the 2009 [Cap-and-Trade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act) bill, and I'm going to be resarching the bill and future prospects for climate solutions. I'm having a meeting with a professor at my University on Monday, who was a pioneer of the different, but similar policy outline, cap-and-dividend. [This is his paper on it.](http://www.progressive-economics.org/papers/CAP_DIVIDEND_states.pdf)

My adviser wants me to delve into cap-and-dividend and, because he believes it is a superior policy framework, ultimately convince a policy adviser at the Congressman's office to favor it over cap-and-trade. This seems like a pipe dream for an intern, but this is my second year in the office so I do have some good relationships in there.

Anyways, what are your thoughts on the differences, advantages, disadvantages of each system? My study is for my Economics major, not anything environmentally science based, so my focus will be on the economic impacts of the implementation.

They asked to see what projects I have done that revolve around film, multimedia, and animation; or something like that.

The ideal candidate for our paid, on-site summer (or earlier, if available) internship position will help us in creating: 

    Company explainer videos
    Filmed executive interviews
    Webinars (design, setup, and production)
    Virtual tours and demos
    Mobile-enabled (non-Flash) multimedia content
    Infographics, iconography, and other branding elements, primarily web-based.

Required experience: 

    Tools similar to Prezi and Camtasia
    Video editing software
    Adobe Creative Suite, including InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop
    Microsoft Office
    Significant graphic design coursework completed
    Relevant sample work—either through school projects or previous work experience
    Knowledge of social media platforms and practices suited to B2B companies

 
Note: Knowledge of HTML/web design and film coursework are a plus, but not required.


Thank you to all who help! I am just a bit nervous since I have been pushed towards the print world of graphic design due to what is/was offered in school."

I've worked here for a year and the opportunity to apply for Supervisor came up, so I applied and I think there's a pretty decent chance I could get it.

I've got an interview (every internal applicant does, five of us), but I'm having second thoughts on whether I want to go through with it, for a few reasons. Obviously this is just a retail job, so it's not somewhere I want to be forever. I do enjoy it here though.

Reasons for:

- Better pay (£6.85 instead of £5.48)
- Looks good on CV for future

Reasons against:

- I don't think I'd enjoy it as much, I won't be working as much with the group of 35 other staff members who I'm good friends with
- I don't want to be here forever. I want to look at something in Law, and do an internship or something but continue working here for money reasons. And I don't think I'd have the freedom to do that as a supervisor.

So really, my question is, do you think the extra £1.27 an hour and having 'Supervisor' on my CV (resume) for the future is worth it, for a job I won't enjoy as much and may possibly limit other career options. Because I'm really stuck here. I don't know which route to go.

1dl82k,11,2013-05-02,[20/m] I just learned my girlfriend [21/f] is pregnant and I'm terrified,Max_Derpin,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dl82k/20m_i_just_learned_my_girlfriend_21f_is_pregnant/,"Here's the situation: My girlfriend and I are currently in college, she's a junior and I'm a sophomore. We've been dating for 16 months, and have been having protected sex that entire span. We always use condoms, but not birth control. Something must've went wrong last month, because last Thursday (after realizing she was a week late) we got a pregnancy test that confirmed she was pregnant.

Regardless of how unlikely this all is, neither one of us is ready to be parents, are still knee deep in our college education, and don't have nearly enough money between the two of us. I advocated for an abortion, but she is too scared of it and her family would literally disown her if they found out she got one. We're probably going the adoption route. 

Pretty much her entire family already knows, but I haven't told anyone in mine yet. I'm absolutely terrified to tell them. I feel like they will never look at me the same. To make things worse, she has an internship for most of the summer in the town where we go to school and is living there, while I have mine in my hometown about 2 hours away. We won't be able to see each other a lot this summer, and she will be by herself over where she lives (her roommates have moved out). I feel unbelievably guilty about not being there for her this summer, even though she repeatedly has told me she'll be ok. 

What should I do? How do I tell my parents? They're coming to pick me up from school tomorrow morning to take me home for the summer. My head is literally spinning right now. I'm not ready for this at all:/

tl;dr My girlfriend is pregnant and we aren't ready to be parents. I have no idea how to tell my parents about it all.

**UPDATE:** Sorry for the lack of responses the past couple days, I've been going through a lot. I told my mother last night. She was shocked at first and seems a tad overwhelmed but after talking about it for a while and putting my GF on the phone, she calmed down very quickly. We're both looking at it all as rationally as possible. She is very supportive, but at the same time wants to make sure that my and my GF have multiple plans in place for this. 

My dad's been super stressed recently doing work-related stuff, so I'm holding off on telling him for a couple of days, when he'll be in a better state of mind to handle news like this. My mom thinks it's a good idea too. Hopefully he will take it as well as she has. It's a little weird knowing it's out there now, but my mom isn't treating me any different than before. She said she didn't want me too feel overwhelmed right away, and it's actually really comforting. 

My girlfriend and I are still pretty scared about the upcoming months, but I think we'll be able to get through it. Now the hope is to find the right adoption family. Thanks again for your suggestions and support. I really appreciated it.

We're seeking interns to write business news articles and feature stories. Unfortunately, we don't have the capital for salaries, so this will be an unpaid internship. However, the reality is that business journalism is hard to break into and this is a perfect opportunity to add to your portfolio and gain valuable news experience in business journalism (plus, this type of writing will make you more $$$ in the long run).

We would prefer students or recent grads with journalism degrees, as we want to add valuable experience to your career.

This is a remote role and only requires one story a week (this is still under discussion).

I do have a few questions if anyone has any advice:

1) I'm an avid pool player (8-ball or 9-ball) and am looking for the best places to play. I'm especially interested in any summer leagues or tournaments. If nothing else, just advice on places to shoot. It seems like North Park Grill and Fast Break Lounge seem the best but you never know what you're getting with pool halls. I'd hate to walk into a bad situation, lol

2) Where can I play golf on a budget? I don't need a ""cutoff jeans &amp; a wife-beater acceptable"" type course but I don't want to put up a week's play just for one round.

3) Where can I buy health foods and local, free-range meat? Are there any famers markets, etc?

4) Any advice on ""must do's"" over the summer? I'm already planning on doing all the touristy stuff and possibly buying a bike to get a more in depth feel for the town. I'll have my car so I'm open to suggestions in the surrounding region as well.

Background: I have 2 years before I finish my Computer Science, BS. I switched from Business (I have my AS) to Computer Science. 

I currently have a 3.48 GPA and I'm wondering what my prospects for getting into Graduate school would be, and if a PhD program (4 years isn't it? Or is it more?) would be worth it.

I currently have two interests: Software Development or Research and Development. It's pretty cliche but I simply want to do something important &amp; I don't think I'll enjoy a job that I can't be creative in. I really want to develop useful apps. 

For this reason one of my dream jobs is to work at Google, or IBM. I have a slight interest in AI.

From this subreddit I've picked up that self starting &amp; internships are really useful, but I have other questions.

What are my chances of getting into a good graduate school?

Should I spend the extra time (if I get into grad school) doing my PhD? Or is it a waste of time?

I'm also thinking about spending an extra semester in school to dual-major in math: how useful would that be in the fields I'm interested in?
Or maybe even spending a year extra finishing up the BS in Business Admin and double major Comp Sci + Business.

What else can I do to try to get ahead and seek out a good job?



EDIT:

It seems like I need to do a lot more research on what I'd want to do in research, haha. I've emailed one of my favorite professors to try to get more informed.

Recently, I was accepted to my dream internship. I was asked by SANLAAP - a non for profit organization based in Calcutta, India to come over for two months and make a student documentary. They fight against the sex trafficking of women and children (which currently is a 700 million US dollar industry in Bombay alone!) As an Anthropology student who is specializing in gender studies, I'm sure you can imagine the rush of excitement I got from reading that email.  
That excitement was soon crushed in paperwork. Basically my school told me that they won't support me because it doesn't involve an area that they are ""focusing on right now.""  
Dont get me wrong! **I am not asking for any money to go towards my expenses**. I am going to use my student loans to cover my plane ticket. unfortunately I was hoping to use that money to give them a rather large donation when I got there for being so generous in welcoming me (they will be providing my room and board.)  
I created an IndieGoGo in hopes that I can raise some money to present to them. The reddit community has not only done amazing things in the past, but has been taken advantage of as well. I am more than happy to present any proof you would like.  
I want to reiterate that none of this money will be going to me. I am willing to eat the cost of the plane ticket with my loans. This will be an amazing experience for me, and theres a cost that comes with that.

:--|:--
[How did you end up homeless? Also, how did you overcome it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rwph5?context=5)|I had never met my father before. And my mother died right before I turned 19. Since I was an adult the government offered me no support. So I took the rest of the money from her bank account and bought a car with it where I lived for about 9 months.
 |I overcame it slowly step by step. Being a cancer researcher wasn't my goal. I first started working at a fast food restaurant. I would bathe in the sink of a coffee shop every morning before work. But I got fired for being unsanitary. [I had caught bronchitis from eating at homeless shelters.]
 |Someone at a  local boys &amp; girls club heard my story and knew that I was talented in music and gave me a stable job as a music teacher. I worked there for 2 and a half years. I went back to school to study music but then changed to Biochemistry. I had excellent grades and then applied for internships in 2012.
 |I was rejected 8 times before I got offered  a nearly $8,000 package to do research at the #7 School of Pharmacy in the world. University of Michigan.
 |Then this summer I signed up for an internship at Lawrence Berkeley Labs and was accepted.
[You could make a whole movie out of your life ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s70hx?context=5)|Lol directed by Michael Bay.
[What precipitated your decision to switch from music to biochem? usually there isn't a lot of crossover between those fields and interests (although, oddly, I once spent a summer NSF REU with an undergrad who had made the same switch over\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s5ff1?context=5)|Bluskale do you have facebook there's some things to say to you.
[U of M huh? Go Green.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s1pku?context=5)|Green but yeah Haha. Michigan State is green. U of M is Blue.
[Hey nice! I have a lot of friends at U of M for grad school. Definitely eye'ing it up myself :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9sckfj?context=5)|Go! Amazing school.
[8000$ a year??? wdf how can u survive off that ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s59hi?context=5)|For a summer.
[Link to i.imgur.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s9kaf?context=5)|Lmao!
[Someone has to do it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s4hiy?context=5)|Hahah.
[Did you go to college? How did you get in and how did you pay for it? What did you major in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rwtxr?context=5)|I went to community college for music.  Dropped out. [homeless] Returned for music, Changed to Biochemistry,  Then Chemical Engineering.
 |I received a good amount of financial aid. I also had to take out a lot of student loans. Every year I have to fill out a lot of paperwork proving my situation.
[Real question: What are some examples of the kind of work a ChemE does in cancer research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rxeok?context=5)|The good thing about Chemical Engineering is that it requires such a strong background in all sciences that  I have a strong Molecular biology background (as far as courses I've completed). So even though I'm majoring in chemical engineering, I'm going to be doing Molecular and Cellular biology research. So I'll be studying how the body attempts to repair itself against cancer. In short, one of the best things about Chemical Engineering is our ability to work outside the field of Chemical engineering.
[Obligatory reddit question: Which is the cooler disease to have: cancer or AIDS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rxeok?context=5)|Typically, Chemical engineers concern themselves mostly with how can they produce cheaper pharmaceuticals. But as fields such as nanotechnology develop, a lot of chemical engineers are interested in nanocoating drugs so that way they can target cancer sells more specifically. These new technique hope to snipe out cancer, rather than kill it with a shotgun (chemotherapy).
[Do you have any ideas on how FAFSA and other financial aid could be made easier for low income students? It seems like people who are low income go through enough trouble that filling out exhaustive paper work is one extra hoop.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9scnky?context=5)|It sucks, but it is free money.
[I just got done bombing a final in Gen Chem II today. How many more ICE tables and acid-base titrations will I need to do before chemistry classes gets interesting again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rxxff?context=5)|Good news I have for you is that when it comes to doing research what you learn in your lab classes is by far more applicable to your actual work than what you learn in the lecture class. It also really depends on what field of chem you want to get into but I've never had to do an acid-base titration after Chem II, but I have had to use a photospectrometer dozens of times.
 |If you're good at really understanding chemistry and predicting what will happen you'll like O chem. But no matter what your skills you'll die in P chem. whats your major? wand what school do you go to?
[Your chemical engineering is different from what I understand it to be. 100% of the chemical engineers I know work in mines or in factories/plants, and none of them work in pharmaceuticals.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9sb1cj?context=5)|People with degrees in Chemical engineering do a wide variety of different things, I know one who became a lawyer. But if someone make produces large scale of pharmaceuticals that's definitely chemical engineering.
[You're still in school right?? Are they paying you to research while at school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s1xxe?context=5)|Happy Cakeday btw.
 |Yes! I get paid pretty well. Definitely not going to be homeless this summer.
[Wait, do you mean you're sill homeless and you'll be able to leave this summer or that you're not gonna go back to being homeless?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9sbcb4?context=5)|No I'm not still homeless. 
[May have been asked (I'm too lazy to check\) but do you have any religious standpoint?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s48ot?context=5)|I am not religious. I consider myself an atheist. Though I would like to point out some of the best scientists I have worked with are Christians and they did not let their religion interfere with the integrity of their research.
 |Religion is what you make it. 
[I hear something like 80% of homeless youth are either sexually assulted or sexually propositioned within 3 months of being on the streets. From your experience, are these statistics accurate? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9ry7as?context=5)|I think I was really lucky to be an overweight black male which kept me in the other 20% but yes definitely. Mostly women and gay men that are propositioned. They usually end up pregnant (one of them by a social worker). I'm glad my sister was lucky enough to be under 18 and ended up in foster care.
[Have you contacted your sister at all since you last saw her? And was she aware of your situation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9sa3gi?context=5)|We always stalk she's doing well in school I think she'll even do better than me.
[I keep seeing facebook posts from these ""green"" and ""conspiracy"" facebook pages about how Pharmaceutical companies already have a cure for cancer but don't release it because they make more money treating the disease than curing it, how certain fruits can completely cure cancer without the nasty effects of chemo, how marijuana is the best cure for cancer, ect. Now I'm no expert on cancer, me still being a high school senior and all, but I'm assuming this is all blatant bullshit. What are your thoughts on this? Btw keep up the great work man!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s0evf?context=5)|Hahahah .
 |Well refer to this for cancer being curable. [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rzk3f)
 |America does have an obsession with Pharmaceuticals though, but we have to ask why is that. The best medicine is exercise, good sleep, good food, and lots of hydration.  But what happens when doctors tell people to stop drinking, stop smoking, or to lose weight. They get angry and they don't stop. They would rather take a pill.
 |Don't trust any science you read on facebook. Science is skewed in the media, even online. Really the best thing to do always is find the primary source and read the research yourself. If it doesn't link backto a website like nature.com, science.com, or some other scholastic journal and the publication isn't highly technical describing what exactly is being done, don't trust it!
 |Cannabis isn't evil but there are some people who are convinced Cannabis can cure all diseases, fix the economy, and bring world peace.  But these people tend to not to be the ones actually doing anything about it so take it with a grain of salt.
[There is a conspiracy theory that humans already have the cure to cancer but do not release it because it prevents overpopulation. Thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rz6og?context=5)|Really frustrates me. I understand how people can see that but once you really understand what cancer is and how it works you will see this is not the truth.
 |First Cancer isn't 1 disease, it is a category of literally hundreds of diseases with all different mechanisms. There is no 1 cure for all cancer. It might be nearly impossible to construct one.
 |Another thing is that if 1 company did have the cure to cancer they would make billions off of it and easily dominate the pharmaceutical market. You can't keep it secret, we couldn't keep the Nuclear Bomb a secret, let alone the cure to cancer.
 |But I understand that people don't trust the government. but if anyone thinks that we have a cure to cancer are keeping it secret, they should come in the lab and try to do the actual research and see how tough it actually is. They should read the papers we have to read and understand how complex it is.
 |Steve Jobs was a billionaire but couldn't buy this secret cure for cancer? But I guess a conspiracy theorist would think maybe he did and faked his death?
 |Another way that we know its not true, is that even if they wanted to make it exclusive, they could just make it expensive. They don't need to keep it a secret. Everyday in the developing world people die from diseases that are already cheap and easily curable. Basically they don't need to keep its existence a secret to stop you from accessing it, they have many other methods.
 |Most of this is caused by scientific illiteracy which is a fault of the scientific community as well as the general population. 
[I took a graduate course on the biology of cancer. its amazing how many mechanisms/routes there are. i was a little troubled about how impressed i was by the whole thing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s6uwh?context=5)|Really complex, I wish there were an easy way to explain it to people. Most people don't even reaally know what it is.
[Thank you for taking the time to reply, just curious what an experts opinion was versus the people usually discussing it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s6dnn?context=5)|I'm glad someone is thinking critically out there, we need more people like you!
[Wow, this is really cool! Apart from the whole homeless topic, what is cancer research like? Is there a process or method to it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9rxo65?context=5)|Well There's many difference approaches. Some people are interested in surgical procedures, gene therapy, new medicines, revising old medicines, targeting the whole body, or targeting specific cells. But no matter what area you're in it takes a lot of literary research. A lot of reading the previous results of a lot of other people's research so you can draw your own conclusion. I'm working on someone else's research team so I won't be deciding what we do, then once we've figured out our objective and the procedure its running a lot of tests. A lot of measuring, a lot of flashing lights through liquids. A lot of gloves and a lot of measuring.
[Wow, I didn't know the research was so diverse! On another note, how's funding for cancer research in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9ry49f?context=5)|Its great right now but some people are trying to cut it!

[That's really impressive, to not only overcome being homeless but to continue working towards self-improvement through education. Congradulations on fighting through and not giving up. What would you say was your biggest challenge through the entire ordeal, and what was your primary motivation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9ry515?context=5)|People will promise to help you out and then get sick of you in less than a week. Sometimes you just survive because its the only thing you can do, and you simply just believe in yourself. It also sucks to realize you're the only person you can rely on but by going through that entire ordeal you never lose that drive.
[What has been the biggest change in your outlook in life from your time spent homeless?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s37mv?context=5)|Before I would hope to be given opportunities.  While being homeless I learned I had the make my opportunities.
[As a music lover, I'd imagine that there are certain songs, albums, types of music, of ""vibes"" that you associate with your story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s67kn?context=5)|This song isn't fast but I'd always think of those days when I hear this one.

Mind telling me where you started in terms of looking for a job/internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s53yo?context=5)|[Link to people.rit.edu](http://people.rit.edu/gtfsbi/Symp/summer.ht) [Link to www.nsf.gov](http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.cf) [Link to science.energy.gov](http://science.energy.gov/wdts/suli) [Link to www.pathwaystoscience.org](http://www.pathwaystoscience.org/Undergrads.asp)
[, congrats to you on your success. i wish you the best going forward.  second, i wanted to ask you what how you would describe the importance (ratio mix\) of 1. your determination/psychological hardiness to see through your difficult circumstances and 2. your raw intelligence/talent as it applied to the areas of academia you pursued.  How would you rate that mix as determining factors of your success? (50/50, 30/70, etc.\) ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9ryy5a?context=5)|That's a really hard question! Since it's pretty much these two factors, Determination and planning. To get through the difficult circumstances is definitely 60/40 Its too easy to just settle with sustaining yourself, which you will learn only works for short time. You have to always plan for the future when you're homeless, so it takes a considerable amount of intelligence. And its really trying on your willpower.
 |As far as school. The hardest part of school for me is simply organization and following directions. Science and engineering are too competitive to rely on natural talent. Only freaks of nature cannot study, no matter how smart you are you're probably not one of them.
 |The keys to doing well in science and math are simply. You have to schedule all your time. Schedule your study time, hw time, following those goals. Maintain your health and mind, eat well, exercise, and sleep. Sleep is one of the most important things. Schedule breaks too.  Being a successful student has only about 7% to do with intelligence. That 7% may or may not be a letter grade. 75% is using your time effectively and following directions. Even if you're an idiot you can pass any class if you simply follow directions and use your time wisely. Don't multi-task. I don't' even use music when I study. NO! TV under any circumstances. the other 18% is maintaining your mind, (sleep, staying hydrated)
[Do you tell people you've met after you we're homeless that you were homeless for a time or do you try and hide it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s6tsc?context=5)|Good question. Very few people know. I woudnt say I try to hide it. But I do keep it to myself. I never know if I'm applying for internships whether it hurts or helps me. I believe that it would be hard for me to obtain a leadership position. I will tell my class this week in a speech I'm doing.
[Did you have background education prior to biochemistry? Or did you learn everything during the time you applied for the classes?  There are courses I would love to take, but then my marks were not that great for them during high school..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s5yfg?context=5)|I took Chemistry in High school .first semester I got a C, second semester I got an incomplete.  Chemistry and math were my worst subjects in High school. But I was really good at bio.  I started college in Trig and I'm taking Multivariable Calculus next semester.
[You are attaching yourself to social Darwinism on purpose? Excerpt from the Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia entry: ""The theory was used from the late 19th century to support laissez-faire capitalism and political conservatism. Social Darwinism declined as scientific knowledge expanded.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dn5q6/was_homeless_at_19_years_old_am_23_now_and_will/c9s9cwy?context=5)|True, people Darwinism mostly said that certain races were better than others.

I was wondering how would I go about asking for more, I already received a letter of offer which I didn't sign stating $15. I was planning on emailing them stating that I would like a higher rate based on previous experience. I just want to be nice about this..."
1dofos,9,2013-05-04,"Trouble with a monster landlord, badly in need of advice. (Warning, enormous wall of text)",[deleted],toronto,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1dofos/trouble_with_a_monster_landlord_badly_in_need_of/,"I apologize in advance for a VERY long-winded and possibly slightly incoherent explanation of my situation. I want to make sure I include all of the details and I've barely been sleeping since this nonsense started.

 

In December 2011, I moved into an all inclusive basement unit of a 6 unit duplex. The landlord always seemed to be a bit... odd, but I had mostly no issues for a few months. 

 

In May 2012, my S.O. moved in and the landlord said that she required an increase of 75 dollars per month, to cover utilities. I did not argue, and signed a new lease with my S.O. on it. I have since come to find that this increase is illegal, but over a year has now passed so I don't know if it'd be admissible in court. She did not file for an above guideline increase with the board.

 

Soon after, the superintendent of the building, who had been there almost 30 years, was suddenly moving out. She didn't seem bitter about it so I did not question it. The landlords then began to renovate the apartment, claiming they were doing if for their son to live in.

 

Then, about mid-march of this year, the LL sent me a message stating ""Hi [laurlala], We are going to rent out the main fllor unit (above you). If u know someone who wants it, let me know. It's 1200 + hydro""
(That is with the exception of the [], the exact text. I have record of all of my sms interactions backed up to my email for reference, as things started getting more complicated from here.) 
I asked her in person something along the lines of ""doesn't your son need the unit?"" and she told me that he did not, and he was instead moving to their unit. 

 

Once again I did not question it. We moved in april 1st, Then the actual issues began.

 

On our lease it states that any people who are to live on the premises full time are to be approved by the landlord in writing. I did not want to rock the boat, so I asked her how this would occur, since my SO and I now had a 2 bedroom unit with a bedroom going unused. She said she had to discuss it with her property management company, and husband, then told us that a roommate would cost an extra TWO HUNDRED dollars a month. That's a 16% increase in rent on a house built/rented prior to 1991, which, if I had done my research correctly, was illegal. I asked her repeatedly to discuss this and she dodged my question. 
 
 
 
(LL= landlord, OP= me SO=My significant other. Just in case there's any confusion)

LL:I'm just waiting for a reply from a property mgr on another rental, so we know what to charge

OP:For sure. she's able to move in asap, so just say the word

LL:Your proposed room mate will need to fill out an application also

OP:That's fine, I'll give it to her whenever you can provide it

next day

*OP: Did you get an answer regarding an additional tenant?

*LL: Yes. It is $1400.  I told SO last night. I'll get the application for u today

*OP: Can we please discuss that increase tonight?

*OP: Will you be available around 8:30?

*LL: Is friend coming to do the application?

*OP: I'll call and ask if she's available

*LL: Ok, otherwise I'll leave the application under your door. Then we need to exchange keys

*OP:She has to fill it an application, but cant she also live with us as an additional tennant, not on the lease?

*LL: She first needs to fill out the appllication, then I need to add her to the lease and amend the rent

*OP:Are you available tonight to discuss this?

*LL: She goes on the lease.

*OP: She doesn't know how long she'll be in toronto, as she is looking for internships worldwide for her thesis. She doesn't feel comfortable signing on for a year.

*LL: She can do a month to month. Its 60 days notice to vacate

*OP: I'd much rather discuss this in person

*LL: U can call me

*OP: I'm at work

*LL: Ok. Talk later

 

When I got home, I knocked on her door and asked if she was able to discuss the increase at that time. She said she'd meet me in my unit. 
She stumbled in, drunk, at which point I showed her highlighted sections of the RTA, as well as some internet resources for tenants and landlords that I found, clearly outlining this exact situation, and informed her that I had come to find that her actions were illegal. She then went on a rant about how she had been ""in the business for years"" and that she had sued people (can this be interpreted as a threat?). She then let it slip that she ""kicked out the old superintendent"" and was ""running the place [her]self now"". LL also told us about how not having a name on the lease was a liability, citing a situation with Toronto Metro Housing, in which a grandmother on a sliding scale rent allowed her daughter to live undocumented in an apartment, got caught and lost her court case. She then wandered through the apartment claiming that she needed to test a key for the back door. 

 

Now my SO and I are not unreasonable people, and we understand that even though we are covering hydro costs, there is an inherent increase in the costs of water and wear and tear with another tenant. We offered to meet her in the middle, and pay an extra 100 dollars a month. She said that she would discuss it with her husband, we said thank you, and that we love the unit, and she left. 

 

The next day, this is the sms conversation that ensued.

 

*LL: After talking to my husband, he suggested we meet halfway between 100 and 200 and compromise at $150 for your room mate

*OP: One hundred was the halfway point

*LL: No, the rent is 1200 for 2 people. I want 1400, you want 1300?

*OP: Well theoretically i wanted 1200.

*LL: My offer has always been 1400. We did check a previous lease, and it was ano extra $150 and that was 5 
years ago

*LL: In reality, you signed a contract

*LL: So 1350 is $450 each on a 3 way split

*OP:I just spoke to the residential tenancies board. They told me that that which you are asking is an illegal rent increase, and the portion on the pertaining to additional roommates in unenforceable by the rta. I also asked about the metro housing situation. Sliding-scale rent based on income has nothing to do with a set rent not based on income. I'd like to go about this in the most amicable way possible, as you have been a fantastic landlord thus far, and I love the unit. I'd like to have new roommate on the lease too as it makes things easier on 
SO and I as well. A 12% rent increase is just too exorbitant.

*LL: Ok no problem laurlala. U decide what u want to do and let me know. Thanx

*OP: I'm willing to go about this your way in terms of paperwork and the lease, and I'm even willing to discuss a raise in price calculated by the overall costs of utilities. I really don't think we've been unreasonable in all of this, and I hour I haven't created any bad blood.

*OP: Would you like to discuss this in person tonight?

*LL:No, my husband told me not to worry about. Thanx

*OP: Would he like to discuss it with us?

*LL: No, you go ahead and do what you want. No need to worry about it. Thanx

*OP: Okay, well we'd like to amend the lease to include her name if possible.

*LL: No that's ok, we'll just leave everything status quo

 

After that, she was a ghost. She watched my roommate move in, didnt even say hello to her. She'd say hi to me if I said it first, but otherwise ignored our presence completely.
 


May 1st at 11:15 pm, she serves us an N12 form, stating that the landlord or landlord's family member requires use of the unit. I find this suspicious for two reasons - when she has moved out the previous tenant, i was under the impression that it was for her son. furthermore, she changed the name of the landlord to her husband, and some person who apparently lives in their unit, who i have never seen or heard of. (I have a suspicion that this is a parent of an international student who was due to mov into our former apartment, and that they have struck a deal with this person to get us out.) I went to their apartment where I knocked on the door, and she opened and I said ""what the hell is this?"". She told me to read it. I said I had, and repeated ""what the hell is this?"" I told her that she knows that this is bullshit, and that I found it very suspicious that her family just gave up personal use of the unit and needed it again, a month later, after signing a lease with a tenant. She told me to take it up with the landlord. (who is apparently no longer her)

 

The next day, I get a letter saying that I came to their house at the wee hours of the night, banged on their door, and harassed and verbally abused the now landlords wife in an ""emotional and hysterical manner"" Then they accused me of doing damage to their home by slamming the front door (the glass in their front door has had a crack in it since October of last year)



I sent texts to the number with which my landlord had ALWAYS contacted me for the past year pleading with them to be reasonable, and asking if we had until the end of our lease to leave. Once again, that night, a letter slips under our door, more threatening this time, and full of more false accusations and exaggerations, informing us that we are on a month to month lease, and that we had sixty days to leave. It also informed us that they had not received our rent (we've been trying to figure out what the hell to do), and called us to tribunal regarding this.
 


Our power was shut off the next day due to repairs that i had forgotten about. I asked her to fix it:

*OP: Our power is not on. Please fix it.

*LL: You were sent a notice on April 30, 2013 about electrical upgrades to the meters and there would be power outages between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm

*LL: Also, you were hand delivered a letter from my husband, [name] on May 2, 2013 to communicate with him in writing for any issues you may have. Thank you

*OP: Oh I apologize, I thought this was still a valid method of communication with y.all. Does he have a cell that I can text him on?

*LL: You can txt him at [phone number]

*OP: Thank you, very sorry to bother you.

 

ANOTHER letter slips under our door that night informing me that I have been harassing the former landlord via text after being told only to do so in writing (Is text not writing?) and that they are going to sue us for a laundry list of accusations. It also told me that I had ""vehemently refused to contact toronto hydro to put the hydro bill in [my] name"" After I had emailed them multiple times the month earlier to do so, and they got back to me yesterday (may 3rd) at which point we set up our account. 

 
I have no idea what to do. I plan to find another place, as no place is worth this level of harassment, but I want it legally on record that all of this occurred, so that if any tenants have issues in the future, that the RTA board has proof of earlier complaints. How can I best proceed?
 
tl;dr :landlord wants more money illegally, does not get more money illegally, attempts eviction, makes our lives hell."

Download the PDF, fill it out on the computer, and save it.

**Longer version:** Anyone who's gotten a security clearance should be familiar with this; it's the ""Questionnaire for National Security Positions,"" or the SF 86. It's over 100 pages and it's not fun to fill out.

I'm in the process of applying for an internship (no clearance, but still a background investigation). I filled out this thing last year, but I didn't sign anything because I hadn't gotten that far in the process. The other day, the agent with whom I'm coordinating pretty much said, in a more polite way, ""HQ changed their paperwork, and since you haven't signed anything yet, you weren't grandfathered in. Fill this new one out."" He proceeded to hand me the 140 page packet. Luckily, I had the old application with all my references and whatnot; also, I'm pretty simple when it comes to my history (I haven't lived in many places, haven't traveled too much, etc.), but it still took awhile. So, I filled the new one out by hand.

Then I realized it's online. **If you ever have to fill one of these out, you should download the PDF, fill it out on the computer, and save it.** Then you have it for your own records, can easily update it (chances are if you apply to one job requiring it, you'll apply to others), and it'll be much neater.

[Here's](http://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf86.pdf) the form. Also, if you think you'll ever need to fill this sucker out in the near future, it can't hurt to start compiling information now. As you can see if you look at it, there is a lot of specific information (dates, contact info, etc.) that is requested, and if you already have it compiled by the time you need to fill it out, things will go much more quickly.

I'm not sure how obvious this is, but I figured I'd share and maybe save someone a little bit of time. I'm off to bed. Stay safe, e'ryone."

Today we Celebrate **EVERYTHING** StarWars. Here at /r/SubredditOfTheDay its become a time honored tradition. It started when SROTD first [started itself.](http://redd.it/h3ppm) And last year's feature was even [better.](http://redd.it/t6ldf) I don't think I can top it. I mean for god's sakes man, there was a poem, a prologue and even a disclaimer! [Ah....](http://i.imgur.com/JQSzoAN.gif) We'd also want to take this moment and honor the fine Jedi MODS Masters and their wonderful achievements. But to do so, you need to know their past. Here is a brief history. 

A long time ago in a subreddit far far away. /u/Noche created /r/StarWars and it was good. Then came a mysterious fellow by the name of /r/jaxspider who promised to bring peace to the ~~galaxy~~ subreddit. And so he did. He vanquished the blogspam siths and did away with the boring default CSS stylesheet. He formed a council of wise Jedi masters to help him, first came /u/Wazow the ever present and motivated one. Then one day /u/ugnaught bumped into them and it was destiny. Over time the council has grown and become even more powerful. Even today they work hard to keep the peace in the subreddit. ~~For the night is dark and full of terror~~ Something something darkside. They are updating the rules as of late so stay on the lookout for that mod post.

Normally we ask the mods questions to make you, the reader, know more about the subreddit. But this is Star Wars. Its an American institution at this point. If you don't know about Star Wars... have you been living under a rock for 40 years? Go to /r/StarWars, HoverZoom over the pictures, comment in the discussion threads, and enjoy yourself. If you love any part of Star Wars, be it light saber battles, Expanded Universe questions or even  something nostalgic this is the right place for you.

&gt; To spice up this feature I'll  ask you the readers some questions instead!

&gt;&gt;1. What was your first Star Wars memory?
2. Whats your favorite scene and why?
3. How excited are you about the new movies?
4. Would you let the wookie win?
5. In your own words why is The Empire Strikes Back the perfect sequel? 
6. How would you torture Jar Jar Binks to the death?
7. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, young Obi Wan Kenobi. Fuck / Marry / Kill. Go.
8. Star Wars is not without it's cringe worthy moments. What real life moment related to Star wars do you still cringe to this day?
9. What one thing would you like to be officially retconned out of existence?

So here's what I ask all of you: Have you ever done something like this? Should I occasionally help her with hints if she asks? I would immediately say ""No! Of course not!""

My original plan was to get a job at a bank as a teller after I graduated, but it seems they are only looking for bilingual people.  

I have been applying to places like Lowe's, Costco, Ralph's, etc. but I haven't heard anything back for about 3 months. I'm starting to feel depressed.

What would be my best plan of action right now?  How do people break into high paying industries?  

Thank you very much for your time, all advice is appreciated.

Does anyone here know of any job opportunities either around the community or within their workplace?

I'm a UF engineering graduate with a minor in business admin (and music performance, in case that's interesting), with courses in technical writing, risk assessment and management, and computer programming. Since last summer, I've been working in IT, primarily doing desktop support and business development. Before that, I did an internship at a utility, teaching at a summer camp, and a few undergraduate research projects.

Additionally, I'm studying programming on my own, specifically Python and Java; I'm also fairly proficient in Fortran, and I'm expanding my skills in Android development. Information security and business analysis have become my primary interests, and I would like to eventually transition into those fields as a long-term career. However, I am open to any position where I can learn, utilize and expand my current skills, and enjoy what I do.

I've done a lot of project management and technical team leadership throughout my education and extracurricular activities. Previously, I obtained security clearances and have continued to maintain a clean background. I'm also okay with traveling within the Central Florida area, or further, provided that my home base can remain in Gainesville.

Anyway, if anyone does know of any leads in the area (technical or otherwise; I'm pretty open to anything), it would be of huge help. I can also send you my resume in a PM, along with my LinkedIn profile and email address for better correspondence. Thanks again for any help that you can provide!

1dnlxg,3,2013-05-03,Weighing Internship Offers,bozoomp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1dnlxg/weighing_internship_offers/,"Hello /cscareerquestions

I am a CS student rounding out my junior year and am weighing my internship offers (this would be my only internship). 

1) Two offers from two small trading firms. Neither are HFT firms, just 'regular' trading. One is for QA / Dev (with strong emphasis on QA), the other is Dev internship. One of the interviews was very tough, and I got the impression that the interviewer was ready to kick me out the door the second I answered a question incorrectly.

2) Embedded programming at a large (but local) company. The team seemed nice, they did not ask me any programming questions, the interview was very loosely defined....we talked a bit about perl, a bit about basketball, and a bit more about the future of the industry etc...no formal questions were asked.

3) Large company company, has their fingers in a lot of different places. The team I interviewed with has tons of short turn over projects ranging from low level programming to webdev to other things. I got the impression that over the  summer I would be able to work on at least 10-20 little assignments, many of which are in vastly different areas. 


My goal is, upon graduation, to basically make a ton of money. The two obvious answers to this are HFT and elite SV/Seattle cos. Would an internship at a 'regular' trading firm help me get into HFT? Or are they vastly different worlds. Should I take offer #3 and be able to put a ton of stuff on my resume after it is over? (My resume is rather bare atm). 

Any suggestions appreciated."

*the case and PSU were in a combo so I arbitrarily split the total price.


When I'm at my apartment at school, this will be my workstation and battlestation.  I'll be playing games like StarCraft 2, Metro 2033, Crysis, etc. and doing work in NX/SolidWorks as well as Illustrator and Photoshop.  I am on a tight budget though, so please keep build suggestions under $700.  

My main concerns are:

* Money. I *am* splurging a little while on my internship, but I would definitely like to save as much as possible while building a good value machine.
* Compatibility.  I've tried to do my research for this, so I feel like the parts are all pretty good choices for what I'd like to do.  I did notice the PCPartPicker alert about how my mobo has USB 3.0 headers for a case with USB 2.0 front panel ports, but from some Googling, it seemed like it would be okay.  Of course, I'll take any help I can get.
* Timing.  I started buying these parts over time to take advantage of sales, and I'm assuming that the next big sales will come around for Memorial Day weekend.  My plan is to buy the rest of the components at around that time, unless I can get them on sale before that.

I am not going to immediately overclock, but would like to have the option in the future.  Please critique this build and help me figure out what I could do better!

Thanks in advance, BaPC!"

1dnibz,8,2013-05-03,For Those Of You Considering . . . (A Rant).,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1dnibz/for_those_of_you_considering_a_rant/,"As I sit back, anticipating my penultimate exam of my law school career, I want to take a moment to offer some words of ""wisdom"" to those of you out there considering following in my modest footsteps.

I don't mean to be condescending and I don't want to rehash the same shit that you have heard a thousand times before but at the same time I would like to get a few things off my chest.

I did a lot of things wrong in my time here. I have a lot of regrets. At the same time, law school has offered me some incredible experiences that I will value for the rest of my life.

Stream of consciousness inbound. My grammar and spelling are liable to be deficient. Forgive me.

So please, take what you find of value here and leave the rest. Here it is:

* Going to law school because you don't know what else to do is a bad fuckin' reason to go to law school and potentially the worst. The numbers don't add up. It's too much work, the tuition cost and opportunity cost is too great.

* Going to school because ""I'm love to debate"" or ""I am so interested in politics"" or ""I like to think conceptually"" is another bad reason to go to law school. The people that do well here are not generally the loudmouths, the talkers. The people who do well here, like steady, meticulous work. They like to read and pay attention to details. They enjoy the intricacies of the law and like puzzles. Bonus if they have experience in the professional world and really appreciate what it means to actually work.

* Do you want to be a lawyer? No really. *Do you want to be a lawyer?* Do you know what a lawyer actually does? Do you know what different kinds of lawyers actually do? Unless you have clarified that you do, in fact, know what a lawyer does and know at least a couple of things specific kinds of lawyers do (bonus if one of the things is a form of lawyering that is easy to get into professionally), *stop and figure these things out.* This is simple stuff but if you don't *really* want to be a lawyer, don't go to law school.

* Rankings matter. Not just in terms of USNWR but in terms of employment placement statistics. T14 is a thing. The rest, maybe less so for the T15-T25, but the rest in the Top 50 are *regional* schools. You can do fine for employment in their jurisdiction but unless Dad is getting you a job it's gonna be an uphill battle. From 51-100 it's an even hairier proposition. Even if you are staying in the jurisdiction, you gotta be good and seriously reflect on tuition cost. As for the Bottom 100, please, please, *please* look at yourself in the mirror and ask why you are doing this. You are shooting yourself in the balls, even if you think you are going to be able to transfer. Which brings me to my next point:

* You are not special. Sure, you breezed through undergrad and graduated *cum laude* no problem. This isn't undergrad. *This isn't fucking undergrad!* It's a different animal. Whereas in undergrad you may or may not have been surrounded by your intellectual equals, and may or may not have had to invest any actual effort in you work (determinate, of course, on major). Here, you are gonna be surrounded by people who were just like you in undergrad. The dirty little secret is *there has to be a Bottom 50% of the class.* And if you happen to fall in that Bottom 50%, your efforts in the job market are gonna need to be that much harder.

* If you have problems before you come here, they will be worse by the time you leave. If you have a problem drinking before, you will be an alcoholic by the time you graduate. If you are prone to depression or anxiety, there will be times where you will feel like a suicidal wreck. If you are fat now, you will be a lardass when you finally put on that cap and gown. *Take care of yourself on the front end.* You will need energy to sustain yourself not only through the academics but through putting yourself out there to network aggressively and do the kind of extracurriculars that will actually help you get a job as an attorney.

* Which brings me to my second-to-last point. When you find that you are not, in fact, in the Top 10-5% of your class, that you are not attending a T14 school, that you do not have the connections, and that you did not make law review, then *for the love of God get yourself some practical experience.* At this point, when you have ignored everything else I have said, it will be your only salvation. Internships in firms, clinics, unpaid charity work, *anything* that allows you to work hands-on with actual attorneys and do, in part, what they do is going to help you. An example: You figure out after the first semester of your 1L year that you are not hot shit and then apply to a yearlong clinic position for your 2L year. You then parlay *that* into an internship or part-time job at a firm where at some point you are offered a paid associateship. That's one model but one representative of the kind of path that average law students in this market need to follow to be successful.

* Finally, take the ""boring"" courses. Take the procedure-related courses (although I actually rather liked them myself), take courses related to writing and research, take cases that allow you to simulate practice. These will approximate, in the academic environment, the kinds of ""hands-on"" experience so coveted by employers. By combining this and my last point, you will have a much better shot securing a job once you find that you are, in all honesty, perfectly mediocre.

Or not. After all, you're a bright snowflake and you did so well on your LSAT. Your GPA in undergrad was high and you didn't even try! You're going to be fine. The employment worries are overblown. Surely the fact that a law school accepted you is *confirmation* that you have value. I mean, it's *law school* after all. Take the substantive law courses, take the theoretic courses, relax during the summers, and *see what happens.*

Either way, good luck. Law school is an adventure and whether you're a stud or a dud, you're gonna need it.

EDIT: Grammar, spelling, additional sentences, and such"

Stuck. 22, out of University for a year, still a waiter, my hobbies dont seem interesting anymore.",[deleted],getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1drc9q/just_kinda_stuck_22_out_of_university_for_a_year/,"I thought I would come here seeking a little advice. 
I am 22 and from the UK. I graduated university last year in Music Business (to some its a joke degree, however Music Industry is all I've ever wanted to do. Plus such a transformative industry riddled with uncertainty intrigues me, you have to be so well rounded for it). 
 
  Anyway, I have played drums or 8/9 years and now I work 42+ hours a week. The job is very busy constantly, quite stressful. I started learning HTML, CSS, jQuery, Java, and I also started learning Japanese. I have been studying these things for 7/8 months and now all I do is work, come home, have a beer and go to bed. I see my girlfriend as often as I can, and I have a horrible predicament where internships turn me down in order to give the position in order to give somebody with less experience an opportunity. On the flip-side though no one will employ me because I dont have enough experience. 
    
Now I get up each day, sit in bed for an hour or two then get up. I have nothing to get up to anymore, my hobbies, my HTML computer stuff etc. I know nobody who shares that shares my interests in real life. I cant talk to anyone about anything I care about without boring them to death. I don't play drums much anymore, I haven't practise Japanese in weeks, and I lazily go over my coding.
    
What do I do? I get up quite early, eat well, drink lots of water, I feel I should either apply for jobs I have no interest in and give up on what I want to do for a couple of years and live the normal 9-5 with weekends rather than 12 hour shifts that start at midday with no weekends/ evenings/days off. I just like being a waiter as if I get an internship I can be more flexible with my hours and work around it while paying rent etc. 
    
I apologise if the format of this seems terrible, but any advice, stories, direction I would appreciate it. This isn't normal is it? It can't be.

edit: I a word."

J: boyfriend of six years. Relationship was rocky, lots of emotional abuse punctuated by good times. We lived together for over two years then separated after a domestic violence situation. The day after I found I was pregnant and told him about 2 weeks later. He moved in with his mom and I moved in with my Foster parents. I told him he could cut contact and not worry about me or the baby and that I wouldn't come after him for child support. He said he would like to make it work. We lived apart for the pregnancy and when our son was ten weeks old I moved in with him and his family for 2.5 years. Last year we moved into a rental house and had our civil wedding ceremony in December.

E: met her about two years ago as she was going through a painful breakup. Her boyfriend had cheated on her. She found out she was pregnant right after and I helped her throughout. She and the dad tried to make it work, but she ended up basically cheating on him and dumping him him 2 months into a year lease just as he lost his job. I advised her against getting back together with him and moving in with him, especially when she was more-or-less with this other Guy. Everything got ugly, but I supported her and ended up being her doula and breastfeeding support. 

Three months after the wedding, j blindsided me and separated from me. Two days later, he moved e in to our bedroom. I was too dumbstruck to protest. Her daughter was 9 months old and e basically let her trash the house with her finger foods. I became a maid. My son was confused and upset and I didn't make waves as to not upset him further. I stayed her friend for some reason. This went on for a month. Two weeks in, I became suicidally depressed and told both e and j I needed her to leave because I was going to end up killing myself. My son was becoming more erratic and upset. 

Neither cared. I found myself thinking my son would be better off without me and realized I was in the bathroom with a straight razor and a bottle of muscle relaxers. I put them up, called my psych and then called a friend, S, went over to his house and told him everything, sobbing. He is actually J's friend as well, but j told me to go talk to him. S was disgusted and furious and has given me his house as a place of solitude since. 

Anyway, e and j had a falling out because she was riding the line between two guys and j asked me for another chance. I gave it. He lasted a week before he was talking to her again about dreams, torture of being apart, and etc. I told him to.get his shit together and separated, but eventually told him I couldn't trust him and this relationship wasn't going to work. 

I'm stuck in this lease with him for 10 more months. I have no self-respect, pride, self-esteem, anything. I feel subhuman. I'm incredibly depressed when I'm in this house. I feel empty and the.only time I feel joy is when I'm with my son or S. J is still talking and hanging with E, even though he hates her kid. He regrets what he did and resents me for not wanting to be with him. I am so angry at him and e to the point of hatred sometimes. I don't want to be because I wont be able to bear the next 10 months. I need to be civil. The last straw for me was me trying to call him to to pick up milk for our son to have him reject my call and find out he has been forbidden to answer my call when he's with her. We also all work at the same place, which really rocks.

They feel they were in the right. Nobody has ever hurt me so badly in my life. In addition, j has told me he.only had the wedding to ""shut me up"". My youngest sister is happily married and expecting her first and my middle sister's boyfriend is custom creating a ring and planning a perfect proposal while she's in China on an internship. I feel so jealous and betrayed. I have decided to never pursue a relationship again and just focus on my son. What kills me is j is taking my son because a) he makes more money and I will have to work two jobs to stay nearby (I.don't believe in child support in this case) and b) I don't want to risk this level of depression returning and affecting my child. I probably sound like the worst mother ever and I have sobbed myself to sleep nightly over the guilt.

I'm getting into counselling and just trying to focus on my time with my son and the fun and long talks I have with S. He really helps to center and rebuild me. Oh, and I've lost 53 pounds in two months on a keto diet/exercise regimen and only have 63 more to go til my weight goal! 

Does anyone have any tips to defeat the.rage? I just don't know what to do? I think I.have rolled the pain in a shell of.anger as to not feel it.

Thanks for reading. :)

I have completed all of my coursework and am (hoping) to finish my thesis this summer.  I am therefore taking one credit over the summer (~$400 for tuition) and will not be a full time student.  I have no debt, but I also now have essentially no money.  My parents *really* don't want me taking out loans.  They're helping me out here and there, but I can't fully depend on them.  I have series EE bonds that they told me to cash to cover my tuition, rent (~$400), etc.  I don't have a job yet for the summer; I'm waiting to hear back from internships, but if I don't hear back soon, I am just going to look for a regular part time job.  

So, obviously, my question is, should I cash these bonds?  Or, should I go against their will and take out loans?  Or, should I just try to borrow more money from them/friends?  If I do cash my bonds, which should I cash and when?  Are there ways to not pay taxes on them? (I know there's something with bonds and education, but I'm not sure how applicable that is to me.)  

I have:
-  8 $50 bonds

* 1 from 1992
* 1 from 1999
- 2 $75 bonds
* 1 from 1989

Try to sabotage the new hire by letting the school know? Just ignore it? Find her weakness and commit a fun prank to mess with her?

I am a rather quiet guy though I love traveling, being outdoors, and the concept of doing something different everyday. Will my reserved nature be a hindrance if I attempt to pursue interpretation?

Should I try out an internship of each? Ideally I would want to find an interpretation internship for next summer. "

There's a lot of threads published about police-candidates who get discouraged when they get rejection or disqualification letters.  The most common replied comments are advice telling you to stick it through and keep applying.  

In the last three to four years I've applied to well over a dozen police agencies, taken written tests, and so forth. In the last six months I've made it to the oral boards five times, passed and made it to the polygraph three times, and passed twice more for the final chief interview.  Every single time I eventually got the rejection/disqualification letter.  Yes, every time I got the notice I wanted to just quit trying.  However, I want to be a police officer; in the last four years I've attained a CJ degree and have worked for private security/investigation companies attaining massive amounts of good starting experience, even completing an internship with a very respected police agency.  I told myself I wasn't going to quit.  

Finally, on Tuesday, after being told ""no"" for four years and draining my body on polygraphs and interviews only to be rejected afterwards, I finally was offered a position as a police officer.  Why?  I didn't quit.  Being a police officer is something I've dreamed of since I was little.  If you truly want to be a police officer you won't quit, no matter how many doors get slammed in your face.

I'm excited to start and been getting ready as much as I can.  I'm researching threads on here for advice for rookies, what to be prepared for, and equipment to purchase (i.e. tourniquet, quick clot, etc.).  

I just wanted to tell everyone who has been getting told ""no"" like me to push through it only if you have the courage and heart to do so.  I don't have the perfect background, I've admitted to some embarrassing things, and I'm certainly not your typical police officer in stature (I'm actually a pretty small guy).  

My new police agency is pretty strict about internet stuff, so I don't think I can ""verify"" I'm a police officer with the mods as I don't want reprimanded for something so stupid, especially as a rookie.

Thank you for all you guys who have posted advice and comments about police work.  It's nice to have a somewhat informal message board to collect information and stories from which to learn.

I just finished up my junior year at college, well known for their accounting program here. I'm doing the 5 year program here and plan on getting my CPA as soon as possible after college. I live in a decent sized city in Central NY, I had a spring internship at the biggest firm in my city, 3.3 GPA, I'm in a couple clubs, and do XC for my school.

So that's just where I am right now. Anyway,I've always wanted to move to a big city like NYC or Chicago. Just a couple questions from a curious student...

1.) Is it hard to get a job straight out of college in a big city?

Like I said, I've always wanted to move out to a big city. I love the lifestyle, and I figured it's a great career move for accounting. However, it's really expensive to move out there and I don't know if it's a better idea to work local for a few years and then have a better chance of getting a job and be financially stable.

2.) Is it overrated to work and live in a big city?

I figured this will vary from person to person, but I've read a lot of posts from other people and quite frankly, I'm on both sides of fence. I love the atmosphere of the city, but I don't think working 80 hours a week appeals to anyone, but then again I know that long hours come with the job so I've already accepted it. Also, moving by myself and starting from scratch seems nice and gives me a chance to really grow up. Does anyone have any personal stories of how they adapted to a new start?

Honestly, I'm just looking for anyone's experiences moving to a big city and any pros and cons they had working/living there.

His mom just called him &amp; told him that her colleague's daughter was denied an accommodation in the city he lives in. The girl is supposed to start her internship tomorrow, so my boyfriend's mom told her colleague that her daughter could stay at my boyfriend's flat for a month. She did this without asking anyone.

I have always trusted my boyfriend. Also, he lives with his little brother, so he wouldn't be alone with the girl all the time, in theory. But this makes me terribly sad (and angry to a certain degree). It doesn't help that I'm very insecure. It worries me that they'll probably spend a lot of time alone anyway, because my boyfriend's little brother is often out partying with his friends or travelling.  

I find it unfair that this random girl that he has never met is going to be living with him while I've been dying to do that. She's going to spend a whole month with him. *A whole month.* I barely even get to see him for more than 4 days when we visit each other. Yet he'll be having breakfast and dinner with this girl every day, etc. I'm scared that she'll end up getting closer to him than me just because of the distance.


I'm rarely jealous because he doesn't have many girl friends and most of them are in a relationship, but this is too much for me to take.

Sorry about the ranting; I don't have anyone else to talk about this and he doesn't understand why it makes me sad :'("

I ended up going with the latter for a number of reasons that seem pretty good, but now that it's a said and done I can't help feeling pangs of regret. If you could go over my reasoning and and give me your thoughts I'd be very grateful. I'll try to be brief.

1) If I went with Berk I could only major in philosophy, whereas at Davis I'll graduate with a double major in philosophy and economics. As much as I love philosophy the post-grad prospects of the degree aren't all that hot even if it's from Berkeley (or so my thought-process goes).

2) Davis is right by Sacramento and the state capitol so I figure I'll have many opportunities for internships. There are no doubt a lot at Berkeley, too, but I doubt the competition would be quite as stiff at Davis. 

3) Davis is a bit cheaper. While the tuition is actually a bit more expensive, I would save a ton through diminished cost of living expenses. 

4) I like cities and everything, but I've had easy access to the cities of SF and Berkeley my whole life so I feel like I've ""been there, done that."" The hippie, college town vibe of Davis appeals to me more.

I realize neither option is really *bad*, it's just that this is probably one of the larger decisions I've made in my life over which I've had total control so I'm really hoping I made the right choice given everything I could possibly know right now. Thanks."

I lost all my male friends since dating him because he's jealous. Last night we went to a local pub with live music, my good friend invited us out. We were drinking and eventually moved seats with me and my friend sitting in the front row of chairs and him sitting behind me (on his own accord, as he could have easily pulled up a chair next to me). I asked him multiple times to sit next to me because he was awkwardly behind us by himself. He refused. At the end of the bands set I turned around to talk to him and he was visibly pissed. I asked him what he wanted to do and he replied in a cynical voice about being ignored and not giving a fuck and to keep ignoring him. My friend was obviously put out. He proceeded to get angrier and was like why would you even get me to come you just wanted to gawk at the musicians and whisper. At  this point I hugged my friend bye and was like ok Im gonna leave now. I leave he follows me and we proceed to get in a huge fight about how we were whispering about guys and I ignored him. He threatened to kill himself because I obviously broke up with him. This isn't the first (or worst) episode of public jealousy that has left me extremely embarrassed. Im leaving for a 3 month internship in 2 weeks. Its hard to stay broken up.. hes my best friend despite this flaw. He doesn't understand that he is in the wrong, and today got mad about 2 guys that liked my picture that I met 3 months ago. He's gotten somewhat better but I just don't know what to do, he's extremely difficult to break up with (I've tried before), and says I'm all that matters in his life and with out me he's nothing.

I got my Bachelor's in Geography from a school in NW Ohio. I still live at home with my parents. I've worked at McDonald's since I was 16, so 8.5 years. 

This is my story (so far). It really took off a few years ago.

Christmas 2011. I was in a relationship with a girl, my first and only serious one, for about 1.5 years. We had a lease to live together in the fall. She was on a Christmas Break trip with her dad in Cancun. She called the first few nights to let me know how her trip was going, but stopped a few days in. I thought nothing of it. Mostly because I spent the entire week building a custom-designed table for our future apartment. She came back Christmas Day and I surprised her with the table in front of my whole family. It was a great moment. 

The next day she tells me we had to talk. ...What. She sits me down and tells me she had been hooking up with another guy pretty much all week in Cancun. I was devastated, but willing to give her a second chance to make it work. It just wasn't the same though. 

I spent that New Year's drinking alone watching Avatar's special features haha. I was so alone, living at home with my parents. 

Things lasted a few more days until she called and broke up with me. That was January 9th. It kicked off a pretty terrible week. Later that week, my 35-year-old cousin hung himself. My mom, a breast cancer survivor, was unexpectedly in the hospital (turned out to be dehydration), and a few days later my best friend's grandfather died. All in one week. Not to mention, at work I was electrocuted one day, stuck part of my hand in a fryer, and my car slid off the road early in the morning. That week was hell. 

Also looming in the distance was the uncertainty of graduation. I was a Geography major and had fulfilled all of my requirements except finding an internship in the field. It would have been possible for me to not get my degree because I couldn't find a job. Feels a little backwards, doesn't it? (But that argument is neither here nor there). 

I was in a really rough spot, so I took to my fraternity (yeah, I'm an actual bro) and laid everything out to them in an email. I'm a pretty introverted person, so my problems are often internalized, but I just really needed some help. 

After that, I got really close with some of the best dudes I know. It was the perfect remedy for the negativity in my life. I got happier, got an internship, got over the ex. Things were looking up. Summer started and I left my job at McDonald's to start my internship. Life was good...and then I fucked it up...

Out drinking one night with some friends, I decided I wanted to go home. I woke up about an hour later as my car was fading off the road into a 6-ft ditch. Yep. I'm a dumbass and lucky no one was hurt. I was facing an OVI charge, which would surely screw over my future. I lawyered up and manage to get it dropped to a Reckless Operation, due to a number of issues with the police's procedures and reports. As part of the deal, I was sentenced to 30 days in jail. Thankfully 27 of those were suspended and I was placed on a 2-year unsupervised probation. The other 3 days were assigned to a driver's intervention program. 

Facing almost $3000 in total charges related to my accident, I had no choice but to get to work. I was granted work privileges, so I went back to work at McDonalds. I let the internship know what had happened, as it was transportation related, and they were okay with it. They let me finish out my term there. 

For almost 3 months, I would wake up at 6am, work the internship from 7a-4p, drive to McDs to work 5p-10p, then head home and sleep. I did that Monday-Friday, plus an 8-hour shift on Saturdays. I had almost no social life. It was exhausting, but necessary. I set myself up for it and had to deal with the consequences. It was no one's fault but my own. 

The internship ended in September of 2012. I was not offered an extension due to ""budget constraints."" So back to McDonalds it was. I had been a manager there throughout college, so that's how I invested most of my time while looking for a ""real job."" 

Application after application, resume after cover letter, email after follow-up email. I never got an interview. Not a single one. Kept sending them out regardless of how defeating it was. It was disheartening. So many of my friends were graduated and getting jobs, making money, getting girls, etc, etc, etc. and here I was...  a 24-year-old college graduate, living at home with his parents, in the middle of nowhere, on probation, working full-time as a Manager at McDonalds. 

For far too long, that is how I would value myself. I was constantly comparing my situation to that of my peers, and deriving my value and self-worth from that. I was down. I was low. I was ready to give up the job hunt and accept my fate that I would never do anything bigger or better that just work at McDonalds the rest of my life. 

Fast forward to February 2012. Still working at McDs, just grinding it out. It sucked, but I really liked most of the people I worked with. Early February though, I was hit again. One of my crew, 19-years-old, overdosed on a variety of things and died unexpectedly. Great kid. Saved up money to go to school. Was set to go to college in the fall. Then he was gone. This really shook a lot of people, myself included. Too damn young to go out like that. JC, my man, I miss you. 

March rolls around and I'll be damned, tragedy strikes again. Three sorority sisters from my university were struck head-on by a wrong-way driver 10-miles out of town on their way to Spring Break. One of those girls was my date to the final formal I had gone to with my fraternity the year before. SH, you are an angel. 

So much loss and pain in the two biggest areas of my life. My coworkers reeling from the loss. My university and Greek community reeling from their losses. Then I headed into April. I was at work and got a phone call from an old friend that one of my friends that I had grown up with was in an accident and things weren't looking good. I come from a really small town and had grown up with this girl pretty much my whole life. She was the second girl I ever kissed. She was one of my dearest friends. I left work to go up to the hospital to wait, as the doctors were running tests to check for brain activity. 

It was odd. I had grown apart a little from a lot of people back home, even though I still lived close-by. We are an incredibly close group of friends though, and so many of my best friends from my youth were there. It was a reunion of the worst kind. 

Anyway, waiting for the results still kind of haunts me. I was there when they delivered the results. I was there to hear her family howl when announced she had no brain activity and was only being kept going by life support. I was there to grieve with my close friends and family. I was there to say goodbye to a beautiful soul. AG, I love you, girl. 

Two years of just awful experiences. So low. So much loss and pain. Throughout so much of the years though, I lost focus of what was important in life. I focused more on being financially successful than leading a successful and meaningful life. 

Then I found this sub. It was almost like a switch went off after everything I had been though. My introverted and analytical nature, coupled with the motivation rampant here, made me realize that happiness and value are products of my own mindset and efforts. Quote after quote from here rang true. I began to litter the wall of my bedroom with post-its, each with messages taken from posts here. 

""Feed the right wolf.""
""Just because life is hard, doesn't mean life is bad.""
""Empty wallets never held anyone back; empty hearts and empty minds hold them back.""
And on and on and on. I began to keep a journal, to keep everything in perspective and as an outlet for my thoughts.

From there, still living at home, I decided to just make the very best of whatever situation I was in. I made a conscious decision to no longer consider my self-worth from the money in my wallet. I figured if I couldn't be rich in money, I would be rich in spirit and life. 

By now we're at Summer 2012. I started working out and dropped 10 pounds. I got a girlfriend. It only lasted a month because she moved, but whatever haha. I started a new position a McDs, which came with more money. I began to save up and budget appropriately. I was making all the right moves necessary to be happy and successful in life. I spent the rest of the year just investing in my life and relationships with all of the great people in it.

The grind was hard, but worth it. Yesterday was my last day at McDonalds, after 8.5 years. I'm moving out to Cleveland today to live with my best friend, who got me in at the company he works for. I'll be out of the country life, into the city, making double what I would at McDs. Bankers hours. No more coming home covered in grease and who knows what else. 

I haven't made it yet. I don't know it if I ever will. My story hopefully inspires someone out there to keep going. Not sure how the editing will look, since I'm typing this on my phone. Thank you for taking the time to read this, if you do. Don't ever quit.

1dqe48,1,2013-05-05,Summer Internship Drug Testing,copanaut,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1dqe48/summer_internship_drug_testing/,"This is not one of those ""I NEED TO PASS A DRUG TEST, HOW DO I DO THAT? ITS IN 3 DAYS"" posts, but rather, I want to know about the likelihood of getting drug tested.


I think I got an internship (final phone call interview coming soon) through a family connection at a pretty reputable finance firm. Now, Im assuming most people who work at this company are pretty straight edge, I also think finance and law firms are the most likely to drug test. I've quit smoking trees for now, and I'm more than likely to pass the test once it comes time so that really does not concern me (I have about a month and I'm going to be working out more and hydrating more) 

What does /r/trees think? Was this the right call? Will I get tested?"
1dq53j,11,2013-05-05,Is a free doula worth it?,blobbycarrier,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1dq53j/is_a_free_doula_worth_it/,"I'm really on the fence about having a doula.  On the one hand, I've never done this before, and I haven't had female friends getting pregnant to learn from other than all of you.  Hubby thought I would need some extra support which is why we switched to a midwife from the OB/GYN I had been seeing for years.

On the other hand, I'm a very private person.  I've told hubby that no one is coming in to delivery until I'm all cleaned up after labor.  Honestly, the more he wavers about all the ""gross"" stuff the more I wonder if I'd be better off without him too.  But anyway, the idea of inviting an extra person in that I barely know to hold my hand and give me back rubs seems a little weird.

My midwife suggested an arrangement that initially seemed like a good idea.  There's a program in the area that offers nursing students as free doulas (they call them ""birth companions"").  The upside is, it's free!  If I'm on the fence about things, why would I pay $2000 for the services of someone I'm not sure I even want around?  But the more I look into it, the more disadvantages I see:

* The birth companions only come to the house once before birth, and then they meet you at the hospital.  So if you're laboring for hours and hours at home, you're on your own.

*  They don't guarantee support - because they're students, they have other priorities.  And my late August due date is during a school break.

* Generally I don't feel old at 29, but I'm not sure I relate to 18-19 year olds anymore either.  I'm sure they would try to be professional, but I know my attempts at being a professional software engineer as a college intern were much different than how I work now.

I think if I want to sign up there would be an advantage to getting on the list before the end of spring semester which is soon.  I'm just not convinced.  Thoughts?

Edit: **TLDR:** If I'm not sure about having a doula, should I sign up for a ""free"" one that's not quite as good as a real one?"

1dq2t8,12,2013-05-05,RA Boyfriend Being Treated Like Shit by Residents. I'm afraid for his safety.,ouchwhydidyouthrowme,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1dq2t8/ra_boyfriend_being_treated_like_shit_by_residents/,"My boyfriend is an RA at our University and his residents are fucking awful. They were friendly first semester when he was being lenient. Of course, they were loud so noise complaints came through almost every night during quiet hours (especially between midnight to 2 AM) from the floors above and below. The RAs on night rounds had to write incident reports nearly every night for his wing, especially on weekends. He was threatened with losing his job if he kept only giving warnings and not writing people up; his boss forbid him from giving warnings anymore and had to instantly write people up. He's not even allowed to tell his residents that it was his boss's mandate; he'd lose his job if he did. Now they think he's just suddenly become a hardass for not reason. He wanted to contest it, but he is paying his own way through college and this is his only living option (that also provides a meal plan) without taking out too many loans.

As for what his residents have done:

* They semi-bullied a devout religious girl into moving out of the hall. She was replaced by a partier who goes out almost every weeknight in addition to the expected college freshmen weekend shenanigans. Since then, there has been more puke in the hallway and girl's bathroom. Someone doesn't know how to aim.

* Stupidly yelled, ""Hey, pour me some Absolut!"" when he was walking down the hall. (The RA he was on night rounds with inspected and actually let them off the hook, risking both their jobs. It's actually the reason his boss had to pull the ""no more warnings"" rule.)

* They've verbally assaulted him for an hour in a group of about 7 after he had to write five of them up due to Uni policy for missing a mandatory closing meeting. They yelled at him while he stayed silent (since responding is a job risk, and they are instructed by their bosses not to engage when this kind of things happens). The residents claim it's unfair even though residents in all other dorms throughout campus are held to the same standard. After this, the instigator of the hour-long yelling debacle tried to argue it with my BF's boss in a one-on-one meeting, but the boss backed my BF up. The instigator also missed the second make-up meeting my boyfriend held on their behalf. 10 people missed the first. He could've easily just written up all 10 absentees, but he took time he wasn't obligated to give to them (as it was the hell-week of last midterms before final's week) out of his day to hold a second meeting. This guy missed the first meeting because he was asleep in his room and his roommate didn't feel like waking him up a second time after he shrugged off the first meeting and went back to napping. Then he missed the second meeting again citing ""Oh, I don't look at the posters on the walls and doors"" as a ""valid"" reason. He had a week's notice. For fuck's sake, get mad at yourself or your roommate. He's getting the village to stone the messenger instead.

* The men's bathroom on their floor had a stall kicked in so hard it dented the door too severely in the middle to be fitted back into the broken hinges. Custodial staff replaced it with a brand new door and it the new one was kicked down within the week. Now they only have one toilet with a door since it's too expensive to replace it again.

* He's had his things stolen from him while in the shower. Their showers are weird, so you have to store your towel in a communal spot, strip down, and then get into an individual stall. That is unless you want to put your towel on the floor in the stall with you to soak up dirty water.

* His door decorations were vandalized and stolen. The best ones were torn down and just completely gone now. He was saving them to put up on his door at this summer internship. The ones specifically made by his best friend on staff are now just vanished.

* His hall decorations are repeatedly ripped apart. It got bad to the point where he had to remove them all two nights ago since two were missing and the remaining 4/8 were in shreds and not really displayable.

* A used condom has been left outside his door, later opened back up and hung off the door knob. Most ""problem female resident"" was the only one in the hall and watched him deal with it. He didn't write anyone up, since he didn't see with his own eyes who did it.

* When he was in the middle of writing up the guy (non-white) who instigated the one-hour, one-sided screaming match and a bystander from the hall made the offhand comment ""oh, my roommate (white) didn't go to the hall meeting and he wasn't written up."" My BF was too caught up trying to get the yelling-instigator to comply that he didn't have time to respond to the blatantly false statement. He's white so, now his non-white residents are accusing him of being racist. (I'm 100% Taiwanese. They know were dating, so what the fuck. The way he was raised, he's now color-blind when it comes to skin tone, so this is just stupid. It's people pulling the race card when it's unrelated to vilify the authority figure; I find it disgraceful) 

* Ripped down a quiet hours notice sign and inked ""NEVER!!"" all over it. Psh. Like that's going to change the rules. This one made me laugh.

* Most belligerent female resident slams her door whenever he walks by and then raises her voice and berates him from behind the closed door. I swear, she has temper tantrums like a four year old. I feel bad for whoever she is mid-conversation with whenever he walk by. Must be awkward for that person.

* They (specifically she...) will complain about him not being friendly enough. He tries to talk to them with a friendly demeanor, but he's met with either flames or ice. He still tries anyway.

* Yesterday, he wrote up the angry girl for singing quite loudly in the middle of the hall during the finals week 24-hour quiet hours. After that, they slipped a printed out copy of the agreement he had to sign before he took on the job officially. They highlighted the phrases ""treat residents with respect,"" and ""enforce policy without prejudice or mailce."" His sense of justice is so straight that I don't think he's even physically capable of malice. He's too patient and has too high a degree of self-control for that. They also failed to flip to the second page and read, ""I will uphold all rules, regulations, and policies set up by [the University] and [Dorm] Community Standards."" This includes the alcohol consumption and noise level rules they agreed to follow when they signed their Resident Agreement papers to live on campus. 

I understand that they feel like they have the right to be angry. For them, halfway through the year the rules changed. My boyfriend did give them a couple buffer weeks to get used to ""no warnings"" by doing silent warnings (standing in the hallway until they noticed) and not writing them up. But this is excessive. 

All of this is their ""retaliation"" for being written up for being loud enough to bother people on other floors into filing complaints. For some reason, it makes sense to them that if they keep destroying decorations that my boyfriend put hours of his own time into, sacrificing sleep for, he'll ease off on enforcing university policies. They've gone so far as to petition to our University to get him fired. He's just following his boss's orders (which he doesn't particularly find fair in the first place, but he's between a rock and a hard place now). 

The night they destroyed the decorations on his door, I was blinded and shaking with rage. I accidentally lashed out at the RAs making nightly rounds when I mistakened them for the trio of his most belligerent residents. Makes me ashamed that I even did that, and I still feel bad about it too. I've been hoping I could run in to them again and apologize, since I was so mortified after I realized my mistake that I fled (yeah, that was pretty cowardly). I didn't know I had that kind of viciousness in me. I just want to be able to apologize to them before the semester is over, because I absolutely regret my loss of self-control and I feel terrible :(

In conclusion: they're self-entited assholes and since they're so belligerent I'm worried for his safety whenever he's in his dorm. I'm actually worried for my own safety when I walk to the bathroom alone on his floor in the hall. 

Actually, I'm even hoping that the worst one gets written up one more time for violating quiet hours and gets kicked out before she finishes finals. She's a whiny forever-child. There's no reason to treat another human so badly when all you have to do to stay out of trouble is be quiet when you're walking down the hall. Especially one resident, the door to the stairwell (where you can talk) is literally 10 feet away from her door.

Sad thing is, last semester when they still liked him, that girl tried to friend him on facebook. He said he didn't accept requests since he didn't want his personal political and religious views to affect his job and make his residents with opposing views feel uncomfortable, so she tried to friend me. The request is still on my account. I'm just waiting for the day when I check up on her and see her drama-inclined self was too busy being angry and flunked out of school.

I'm just glad it's finals week, and in a week they all move out. I'm tired of being tensed and stressed when I go see him, and all this tension is affecting his usually optimistic demeanor. I'm tired of being afraid for him. I'm scared they'll cause him to lose his job, because it's easier to fire someone if a parent or somebody threatens to sue. Luckily, he and his direct boss are quite close and have a very good rapport. He also gets along with all the other RAs he works with, so I'm hoping that if things do start falling to shit he'll have plenty of backup. 

I hate seeing him being treated so badly and not being able to do anything about it. I'm not even supposed to know this much about what happens. I want to be able to protect the person I love and this is just so terrible. :(

Fuck, this was long. Obligatory: tl;dr: I love him, I'm worried for his safety, I hope the two biggest sources of stress are either kicked out or move out soon. I wish this wasn't so terrible. He deserves better than being surrounded by 30 people who hate him and are basically bullying him/threatening his job and financial ability to stay in school."

In any event, with two of my most difficult exams out of the way, and two I anticipate to be not as difficult in the next week, I'm ready to give this another try.

Throwaway just for the record.  I recently got offered an awesome internship, and I was stoked. The minute the lady said hair follicle test, I was a little less excited.  I haven't smoked in two weeks (420) and before that smoked maybe once a week max, probably less. I believe I'll be tested when I start the job, in early June. I've been research all friggin day, lots of different methods to pass it and everything. I even started treating my hair as soon as I could.  Doing the ""macujo method"" if that rings a bell with you guys. Its soaking the hair with vinegar, then an acne treatment containing 2% salicylic acid, then tide detergent. Some success stories, but I'm still sitting here shittin my pants.

Then I think, I have an advantage that a lot of people don't here. Time. I could shave my head to 1/8 inch and all that hair is clean.  And I could shave the rest of my body, and they couldn't do anything about it.  It's not like the test is in a day. Do you think this is foolproof? Honestly if it is, I'll break out the razor right now.  Or do you think I should continue with the hair cleaning methods?

Looking back at this post, it's definitely biased because I just thought of the idea of shaving since I have so much time.  There is a small chance they ask me to do the testing while I'm at school, but it's not likely because I go to school kind of far from where the actual job is.

In any case, thanks to whoever read my post. Any input is much appreciated.

1dpyzu,21,2013-05-05,I 24M Met a Great Girl 24F and Now She Is Not Ready for a Relationship,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dpyzu/i_24m_met_a_great_girl_24f_and_now_she_is_not/,"Sorry for the long write up here, but I am pretty confused right now as to what has occurred over the past few days. I (M24) met a girl (F24) a few weeks ago through mutual friends.  She’s a graduate student and knows where she is going in life and is very mature for her age. We hit it off pretty much on the first date and spent over 4 hours having a few drinks and just going back and forth about everything.


__
The second date went even better than the first. We went mini golfing, then to Froyo where we talked for almost 2 hours. After we drove back to get her car from the mini golf place we ended up going across the street and kissing, etc. for a while. Again, the date ended very well.


__
For the third date I picked her up from school.  We went to a nice restaurant, had a great romantic meal and laughed and talked the entire time. I then drove her home and met her mom, which we talked for about ten minutes and I got a good “vibe” from her. After her mom went to bed we talked for a while and then ended up having sex. Sex was incredible and the night ended well.


__
A few days later she invited me over to her house making the meal of MY CHOICE. I of course brought two great wines of her favorite type to go with the meal. The meal was delicious. Good conversation the entire time including when we got back. Ended up having sex again.


__
Two nights later she had me over to meet some close friends for snacks, drinks, and various board games.  Things went pretty good overall, the friends generally seemed cool and we all laughed throughout the night. A couple hours after midnight some of her friends began to crash out, so we went to her bedroom and talked/kissed and went to sleep.


__
Few days later for our 5th date I was going to take her out for drinks because she aced her last final of her first year of grad school. She ended up not getting out of her internship until a couple hours later than expected so she recommended that we just hang out at her house and have some drinks there. After we had drank some and were talking on the couch I told her that I wanted to be in a relationship with her. She told me at this time that her last long term relationship ended a few months ago. I had no idea up until this point that it ended so recently. The reason she ended the relationship with her last bf was because he did not want to get married, have kids so she felt there really was no future with him. I told her that I was okay with not getting in a relationship right now and just continue to see where this goes. We talked for some time about relationships, etc. We ended up having sex again, for another fairly great end to our little night.


__
The afternoon the next day she messaged me that her friend had canceled on plans to hang out with her after her internship and asked if I would like to come over and watch a movie. I did and we went to pick out a movie. Somehow we ended up picking up a movie that had direct parallels to her last relationship. It was supposed to be a comedy but it got pretty serious. Literally 80 percent through the movie she gets a weird look on her face and goes this movie is terrible I don’t think I can watch it. I agree with her and we shut it off. She then tells me that it’s reminding her of her last relationship. At this point I’m thinking uh-oh, we have been holding hands the whole movie, things going relatively well and then this. We go downstairs and she tells me that she told her mom earlier that night about what we had talked about the previous night, with her not being ready to be in a relationship. Her mom apparently said that she needs time to be single and learn to live like that for a while. She also told her to “be careful” with regard to me, which I took to mean be careful not to hurt me. When she told her mom I was coming back over that night, she said her mom rolled her eyes. I again reassured her that I was fine just keeping things the way they are, not jumping into a relationship just yet.


The next day we only sent a few texts, which was definitely less than usual but I figured that she was just busy.

On the 3rd I texted her Good morning! and she didn’t respond until that evening with basically:

Sorry I haven’t been talking to you as much. I realized I need more time being by myself. I’m not ready for a relationship like I thought I was. I am sorry to disappoint you :(

I responded saying that she has yet to disappoint me. That I understand that she needs more time. And also that knowing that we both like each other, I’d hate to see something possibly great for both of us thrown away just because she needs time.

She then said sorry if she’s “mia” for a while but she needs time to herself and to focus on stuff other than a relationship.

I clarified if she doesn’t want to hang out or talk at all and she said she does but that she just wants a “breather for a bit”.

I told her “Okay. That’s fine just give me a call whenever you’re ready”

She said OK. Thanks for being so understanding. It’s not like I just wanna stop talking completely but I think you know what I mean.

I actually don’t know what she means by that but I figured I would give it a week off from talking to her and see if she comes to her senses after a cool off period.

What are my fellow redditor’s thoughts on this? I’m sorry if this is fragmented, this is my first ever post about something like this.

TLDR: Met awesome girl that got out of a LTR a few months ago and suddenly changed her mind about wanting to be in a relationship. What is the deal?"

It's pretty simple to prepare for the military and the Australian Defense Force has already told me that I'm welcome to study with them and will receive a guaranteed career when I finish.

But in terms of preparation for post-graduate study, I'm a little less certain. I think I could easily get acceptance at the university of Sydney since that's where I'm completing my honours and it only requires a Credit average. But I'm also considering studying internationally, specifically at one of the Ivy league schools in the US. What is the GPA requirements to study there?

I'm a good student but I'm not a HD+ student, so I'm not sure if I can get in on academics alone. I'm currently learning arabic at a private institution, but I've been considering enrolling in it at Uni and when I graduate, I could try to get an internship with one of my professors whose doing a research program and needs an arabic speaker to help out. Would this increase my chances of acceptance at one of the schools in the US?

Any other advice?"

We met online -- OKcupid, to be exact. I really hesitated having our first date. In fact, I did a douchey thing by cancelling on him and then pretended that I was suddenly free. He was jovial to have our first date though. I wasn't.

We have very different backgrounds. He's white. I'm South Asian. He's an over-achiever. I'm an under-achiever who struggled with depression, school, social and personal relationships. He finished university on time. It might take me 6 years because I can't handle more than 3 classes a semester. He worked hard and earned amazing marks while volunteering and playing rep waterpolo. He's fit and athletic. I'm overweight with health problems. 

His family is wealthy. He got to travel the world. He left for a family vacation to Europe and it was just another vacation for him. There was no excitement. I've never been on a family vacation. I've left the country twice but I was too young to really remember. 

I work a shitty barista job. He works as a research assistant and wrote his MCATs. He's probably going to get into medical school. His father and his father's father and quite a few generations down were all doctors. His mother works in the medical field too. My parents are racist, protective, sexist, immigrants who own a restaurant. My parents were mentally and physically abusive. Almost every day of my life, I've had to deal with misogynistic rules, double-standards, and traditions. My brother's made it worse for me. My parents and family discouraged me from going to university. They thought I'd never make it.

I have +40k in school debts now. He has none. He's got a trust fund and lives at home with his family for free.

I moved back to my parent's this summer to save money but mostly to be near him. I only see him once or twice a week. I regret not staying near my university and finding a job or an internship this summer that could benefit me in the long run.

I'm struggling with depression and anxiety. My moods have been up and down, but mostly low now that I've moved back. He's happy. He has a supportive family with little-to-no problems. 

He even told his family he met me online. Which was awkward for me... I met his mom the other day for a minute. She just shook my hand and kind watched me from the corner of her eye while she spoke with her step-daughter. They think I'm some nut from the internet and no one wants to tell him he's setting himself up.

I don't know what he sees in me. I don't see this going anywhere. Once he's bored of me sexually, he'll probably just dump me. Like they all do.

When is he going to see he's with a person with low self-esteem? When will he realize that he can do better? When will he realize he could be with someone who makes money, is happy, and everything I'm not?"

1dpyad,1,2013-05-05,No Direction,kersius,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1dpyad/no_direction/,"So a few years ago, I was working a dead end office job. I was really failing there, playing video games and surfing the web instead of doing my work. I started out as a star employee but slowly dropped. Finally, one day I went for a walk and decided that I was done. I have thought a lot about suicide over the past 12-15 years but that afternoon I made the decision that I was going to finally do it. A great weight lifted off my shoulders and I felt free for the first time in years. I decided to focus and finish college and study what I wanted to study: social work not business. After all, what's the worst that could happen? I could always come back to suicide if it didn't work out. I worked my butt off. Went to community college and graduated with a 4.0, perfect GPA. For context, when I went to college the first time, I dropped out after 2 years with maybe a 2.0. I then transferred to one of the best public universities in the US. I was still doing well, learning a lot and doing well in my classes. I got into the golden key society for the top 15% of my class. Last summer I had a great internship and learned a lot. I had a tough fall semester but still pulled off As and Bs. I start getting my usual anxiety about school and am nervous about applying to graduate school to get my Master's which I need to do what I want to do. I end up only applying to 1 graduate program, the one I think I am most likely to get into. The others are out of state and I can't see spending that kind of $ in loans to attend them. Fast forward to now. I get my notice that I didn't get into graduate school. The program that was supposed to be my ""safety school"" rejected me. Now I don't know what to do. I'm afraid that I will have to return to the hell that is retail, and that I won't be able to get to where I wanted to go. A BA in Sociology doesn't help much unless you're going to graduate school. 
Now I'm feeling that I gave it a shot, I tried my best and failed. I will graduate in two weeks but it won't help me much. Career wise I'm not much closer than I was 3 years ago. I've barely been able to hold on and keep pushing myself in school knowing that I was on track to fulfill my dreams. Now that it's been derailed I don't think I have it in me to keep going. I tried my best and it wasn't good enough. Some people just aren't meant to make it I guess. 
I look back at the decision I made 3 years ago and I'm having trouble not following through this time. I made a deal with myself then that I would give it a shot and I did. I really did, I tried my hardest and I failed. My fears were confirmed. I just don't know what to do.
TL;dr: Made a deal 3 years ago to wait on suicide plans and to try one more time. Didn't get into grad school which I need for career. Trying to find a reason not to commit suicide now."

That sounds a little melodramatic, and it probably is, but this month sucks.  I feel like I have nobody to talk to.  No friends.  No classmates.  No significant other.  For fuck's sake, I had to find out the address of a school get together at a professors house through google because nobody in class would tell me.  I'm so burned out from school, from giving my all (that isn't quite good enough) to work in a field I'm not even sure I want to go into anymore.  On top of that, my secondary choice is even more competitive than my first.  Summer's coming up?  Sure it is, with another full course load plus the full-time work in my internship.  Plus 2 more semesters until I graduate.  

Oh and the girl I've been in love with for years has pretty much given me the answer that she's a lost cause, even though she tells me she loves me too.  Sorry *your name*, you can't just tell me you choose me and stay with someone else.  Shit doesn't work that way.  You've made your choice and that's fine, but don't expect me to be there for you.  Again.  I want to just break down and cry so badly, just let go of it all and fall into that abyss.  But I can't.  I just can't anymore.  All I want is to feel better and to be happy, but I can't.  I feel guilty about everything and all I want to do is to just be happy and feel good, but I don't see that happening to me for a long time if ever.

I feel so weak and pathetic, like I'm flailing around and can't do anything because I'm SO TIRED and just need a break... but it's never enough.  I can't keep up with the last ounce of work I have to do.  But I need to.  I need to but I don't have the heart.  Why am I doing this?  Fuck it all.

I have self-taught myself photoshop and HTML/CSS and I have tried my hand at creating logos/websites. I was told by some people (parents, relatives, classmates, and teachers) that design is a nice hobby but the pay is awful and it's not really worth paying money for a degree; that designers are a dime a dozen, and crowdsourcing and other websites make their jobs practically useless. 

All of my friends are pursuing ""practical degrees"" (as they call it) in business, engineering, the hard sciences, etc. because they want to earn money, support a family, and pay back their college debts, which they tell me I can't do with a creative job in design.

I really want to pursue a job in this field, but after hearing this feedback from everyone I talk to, it sure doesn't encourage me. I could pursue a different degree in something ""practical"" because I am a hard worker and I get decent grades in hard classes, but I don't think I would find passion in it. 

I am a senior in high school and I am in the highest level of art available in my school, AP Art Studio (since we have no ""design"" classes). My art teachers have told me that I am the most talented student with the strongest sense of design at our high school. 

So I am conflicted. Can I just ask you guys:


* Do you have a regular salary?
* Are you content with your current salary? Does your salary actually support your life, or are you constantly stressed out about money/ constantly in debt?
* What type of job do you currently have?
* What type of degree(s) do you have (BA, BFA, MFA, etc)? 
* Do you have any other degrees besides a design degree? (art, marketing, computer science, business, etc)
* Was your degree worth the money?
* Did you go to an art school or a regular university with an art program?
* How long did it take you to find a job once you got out of college?
* Was it easy to find summer internships while in school?


And if you have any other helpful tips for finding a job/going through college, that would be great. I am feeling uneasy about it now, but I understand that if I choose something that I love to do, it's not going to be easy. I know I'll have to work hard. 

But right now, I feel like everyone is pressuring me against following this career, and I just need some success stories to get my hopes up to pursue it. There is nothing I would like better than finding a steady job in something I love to do."

So I'm (28M) a post grad medical intern and with my busy schedule I still manage to have time for my loved ones. I have a gf (25F) for like 5 months now. She is a family friend and we met because our parents wanted us to have this kind of relationship. She seem to pretty know me a lot and as time goes by, I think I'm liking her already. We do the usual stuff, I would go see her if my time fits and as much as we can, we talk almost everyday too, those stolen time when I'm at the hospital, just to let her know, I'm thinking of her. To sum it up, I'm currently happy, we even plan to live together by the end of sept. 

Last month, my best friend sent me an email telling me that she had talked to my ex girlfriend (26F). My ex girlfriend and I had a very deep long term on and off long distance relationship. We are continents apart and for 4 years we really tried to work it out. I don't have any communication with her for the past two years now and it bothers me because I know her, she wouldn't talk to my best friend for no reason and so after few days of thinking I decided to send her an email, just to catch up, a simple hi and hello, how are you. Then she replied by saying, (can we talk, please? pleasee?), she gave me her viber account and yes we talked. 

I know that she's in a relationship right now, with the same man whom he liked before dumping me. As much as possible I made our conversation so casual, but deep inside I am feeling so good and bad at the same time. It's good to know she still cares and my feelings are kinda recurring, I'll admit to everyone that I still love her more than i love my current gf. My gf even know the story between us, and I'm just so lucky for having such a girl like so full of hopes and positive outlooks in life. Going back to my ex gf, we continued exchanging msgs in viber for a month, and it came to a point where I can sense although she not directly telling it, that she still wants me back. And it seem so easy for her, because she knows I still love her, and its like, ""come here, ditch your girl, and i'll ditch mine"". I was thinking, should I come? I never even once tried to screw any relationship because I have big respect for everyone, although I feel betrayed, I have long forgiven them somehow, but the scar is still there. I'm afraid to try it once more for I'm not sure if I really can't fight my ego that i was dumped for another man just because I'm not there. I know how proximity matters but as if it will be forever, If only she have waited. 

I'm so confused, now my ex gf is acting so strange, she would ask me about my gf, and she wouldn't let me ignore it. she still has this charm of letting me tell everything to her but when I'm the one who is asking, I always got no for an answer. She wouldn't let me know her status with her guy, she wouldn't let me know what's bothering her or what makes her upset. What to do guys? I keep looking on my phone for her msg and I can't control myself either to send her a msg. Its so strong, its coming back again. Should I just ignore what I feel? I don't know how to move on again, I suck at doing this. I don't want to hurt my gf either. I need some advice because I know there is a lot to consider with whatever choice I will make.

1dpigq,1,2013-05-04,What's the best way to make my roommates use my deposit for rent?,BrackishSor,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1dpigq/whats_the_best_way_to_make_my_roommates_use_my/,"So I am staying 3 months in NYC for an internship and the only short term lease near my job was with (what I thought) were 3 Chinese students. When i went to look at the apartment, I noticed that the bathroom was not super clean but manageable and the kitchen seemed quite dirty. The living room had a ton of boxes/clothes sitting out and the room I was supposed to move into still has clothes/boxes in it.

The rent was pretty cheap and the head tenant told me everything was just super messy from the one roomate moving out and things would get better. Because I had no other options forthcoming I went ahead and took them up on the room. 

That's when the trouble started.

First off, when I moved into my bedroom two weeks later...there was still stuff all over the walls from the previous person. They had also left garbage out on the balcony and in my closet. There was also a bed left there, which was somewhat convenient but still unexpected. I thought the room was going to be actually cleaned before I moved in. 

I also noticed that the kitchen was messier than before...by far. Not only that but the stuff that was supposed to be cleaned out of the living room was still there. It became obvious that the way I saw it right off the bat was closer to the way things ALWAYS were, not just messy from the roomate moving.

Then to top it off I was shown a second bathroom which I didn't even know existed. This was the ""boys"" bathroom and I was supposed to use it instead of the one i was shown (Which turned out to be the girls bathroom). When I asked why there was a bathroom for the one girl living there I was then introduced to the fact that each bedroom in the 4 bedroom apartment (except for mine) had 2 people living in it! Not just me!

In short, i feel super mislead and would like to get out. I gave them a months rent as deposit, but haven't paid this months rent yet. I never signed any kind of agreement with the other tenants, so I'm wondering what you guys would do. Would you just tell them the deposit is this months rent and I'm leaving in june? Would you pay and suffer? Would you tell them nothing and just leave after this month?

Please help me! I've never been in a situation like this."
1dpi1q,0,2013-05-04,DUI...Next steps?,duithrowaway54,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1dpi1q/duinext_steps/,"First, I want to preface this by saying the decision to drive drunk was incredibly stupid.  There is literally no excuse for it.  I don't know why I decided to.  I am not trying to get out of the charges; I am guilty.  I have placed a call to a lawyer already, but also assume that I won't here anything back until Monday.  My mind is still just going 1,000 miles per hour and I was hoping to get some feedback about what to expect until I hear back.

While I admit fault, and I am not trying to get the charges dropped, I also want a lawyer to make sure I can get a fair punishment.  I am 25/F with no prior charges of any sort.  

I am a full time student, attending school as an out of state resident (originally from Virginia - this is where my car is registered &amp; I am licensed).  The offense occurred in Oklahoma.  I was pulled over for driving 5 under the speed limit (30 in a 35), and weaving.  The officer approached and asked if I had been drinking, and I admitted I had.  I don't know if this was a smart idea or not, but there was no denying it.  I figured I might as well cooperate and hope for some brownie points.  Anywho, I gave over my registration and then anxiety set in.  I vomited.  The officer had me get out of the car to perform the field tests.  I failed.  No surprise to me.  The officer asked if I would consent to a breathalyzer.  I then told him that I wasn't familiar with what my rights were in Oklahoma, and that I wanted to consult a lawyer first.  He immediately hand cuffed me and placed me under arrest.  I vomited again.  He asked me again to consent, and I told him again I wanted to speak with a lawyer first.  

I get down to the station and I'm processed.  I'm asked a third time to consent, and I again tell them I'd rather speak with an attorney before proceeding.  Nothing else is mentioned.  

I was released on bail this morning.  One of the sheets of paper I was given instructs that I need to appear at the court within 3 business days.  It doesn't really say what it is for - ""initial appearance and arraignment.""  Do I need to have a lawyer present with me for this visit?

I have since learned that refusing a breathalyzer in Oklahoma is automatic grounds for license suspension.  I have the ability to appeal the decision, in writing, with the Department of Safety.  Is this something I do on my own, or can I expect a lawyer to assist me with this?  In addition, I do not have any recollection of them telling me that my license would automatically be suspended.  I mean, I'm sure they did, but at the same time, I do not feel that I would have still denied the breathalyzer if I had known that.  I suppose that's neither here nor there, but I figured I'd throw that out there.

Finally, to complicate things, I am supposed to be leaving next Sunday to take a position out of state for a summer internship.  Am I even allowed to leave the state with charges pending?  Do I need to get clearance from the court first?

Any help would be appreciated.  "

1dph5h,13,2013-05-04,Considering Accounting,wocamai,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1dph5h/considering_accounting/,"Hi all,

I graduated in 2011 with my BS in (pure) mathematics from a good school with a good GPA, but have had trouble finding a job. I recognize now that it is mostly because I didn't work as hard at career oriented and professionally oriented work (internships and networking) as I did at doing well in classes. 

I've been looking for something to help me find myself in a career rather than just a job and accounting seems appealing, since I like working with numbers and data. I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations for breaking into accounting. My thoughts right now are to start taking classes at a nearby Community College and leverage that into an internship and hopefully into a job. Do you think that would be effective? Alternatively I could consider entering into a second bachelor's but part of the appeal of the CC course would be starting quickly (I suppose I could even attempt to begin at the CC and transfer those credits to whatever university i would attend). 

In short, does anyone have ideas for how I could find my way into accounting?

Thanks

EDIT: It's unbelievable how helpful all of you are. Thank you again /r/accounting, I'll be coming back to this thread tomorrow, but I'm falling asleep in my chair now."
1dpf4t,0,2013-05-04,"Reddit, why will putting myself through college be worth it?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dpf4t/reddit_why_will_putting_myself_through_college_be/,"**TL;DR:** I am a 26-year-old who set aside a career to return to school and finish my BA through Columbia. I have one more year left, but at the moment, putting myself through school is so stressful that I feel like I won't make it graduation.
___

All but hidden in plain sight, a plaque on the left beam of Columbia University’s main gate bears this inscription: May All Who Enter Find Peace and Welcome. 

As a kid, when my family and I lived six blocks south of those gates, college seemed as accessible as walking through those doors. The campus became my playground: I tiptoed along fountain edges and raced past research libraries on my bike. On nights when the university opened its observatory to the public, my father and I would marvel at the telescopes as we gazed at the celestial phenomena. College encouraged reaching for the stars.

Shortly before I turned 14, my father and I had The Talk. Much as he advocated a college education, he’d never be able to finance one. I considered the acknowledgment generous; it allowed time to lay groundwork for the road ahead. So that’s what I did. I’d already obtained entry and a full scholarship to a prep school that had produced a former U.S. attorney general and Oscar nominees. Hoping to follow in their footsteps, I won a slew of local and national scholarships, studied two languages despite native-level fluency in three others, volunteered, occupied leadership roles in student groups and landed a top internship before even leaving high school.

That Ivy League-loving prep school  is now a 26-year-old without a college degree. The reasons do not include rehab, jail, pregnancy, terminal illness or joining the circus. These days, the gates are not of iron but cost.  

After high school, I spent several semesters at a nearby college, one I could afford without loans. When financial burdens became overwhelming, I justified my exit from academia by pouring energy into a career, and writing stories for places that you and your mother have heard of, until I returned to academic life and enrolled at Columbia University’s School of General Studies, which is designed primarily for those who have taken at least a year’s break between high school and college. Getting in was the first hurdle. Unlike the university’s other three undergraduate schools - Columbia College, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Barnard College – financial aid is extremely limited.

One year, my adjusted gross income was under $14,000, and the government determined expected contribution to be $1,322. The grants from the school amounted to $9,600 and government aid totaled $5,000, leaving savings and student loans to cover the remaining $18,325 in tuition, which doesn’t include room and board, textbooks or meals. The financial aid director said that I “did everything right,” but that there wasn't any more aid to go around - at a university had a $7.8 billion endowment in FY 2011. 

To cut costs, I live with my parents but cover all of my personal expenses – food, books, clothing, the occasional night out with friends. If I forget to pack lunch, I consider skipping meals until I return home. A professor once ordered dinner for the entire class to celebrate the end of the semester, never knowing that I would have skipped eating otherwise. Of course, I work, and because of fluctuations in my schedule, my term GPA’s have varied between 4.0 to… not a 4.0.

The school’s healthcare plan offers mind-bogglingly amazing resources without additional charge: multiple on-site clinics, psychological counseling, even a nutritionist. The irony is that I’ve canceled off-site appointments when the $30 co-payment exceeded funds in my bank account. And I am far – very far - from alone, though I know I am for.
College is not for everyone, but as a character on the West Wing says, paying for it “should be a little easier.” I have one year until graduation, and at the moment, I feel like I won’t make it there. So, Reddit, why is any of this – the all-nighters, the exams, the monumental efforts that resulted in literal failure, the years of debt ahead -  worth it? "

WHY?! I could have let the research associate/PhD student explain it, it's just that I subconsciously thought they didn't know it as well as me. 

And I have a hyper/excited way of talking about things that probably made it doubly annoying to hear my voice.

Seriously, when I think about things like this that happened during the day, I can't help but just wish I didn't exist. It's all part and parcel of the fact that I am pretty fucking narcissistic and prideful, and I just make myself look like a fool 95% of the time.

I know it's next to impossible to tell me exactly what I'm doing wrong without seeing my resume and cover letter (which I can provide upon request, but won't assume people will be eager to provide free career counselling to a stranger on the internet), but are there any common mistakes you see that prevent otherwise qualified people from making it any further than the initial stack of applications?

I've been looking for a job for 8 months and I have only gotten 1 interview that didn't go that well. I'm a Mechanical Engineer that lives on the east coast (but I'll move literally anywhere).

**Bad things about me**: Terrible GPA, no internships, and I am terrible at interviews (anxiety stuff). I've also stopped applying because that black hole that resumes go into and no response ever comes out eats at my soul. (Hundreds of resumes and maybe 10 replies saying 'no, go away'.) 

**Good things about me**: I like robotics, my senior design project was on robotics. Like robotics so much that I volunteered at a FIRST Robotics competition and it was the greatest time I've had in a while.  I can program a little bit and I can pick up the languages I don't know pretty quickly. My minor was in economics (I don't know if this good or not).

My tangible things are pretty shitty. My intangible things are all related to robotics. The one interview I did have, all I talked about was robotics (because that is all I have) and the lady at the end said 'you are probably going to be bored here, if you want to do robotics you should go do that'. There are not that many robotics companies in the world. The ones that do exist only want experienced people that have been working on robotics for a while.

I talked to a recruiter last week and told her I will take any job that exist in the world of engineering. She said that would be hard based on my resume and how I have no experience. I can work retail but I don't even know if those guys want me. Before, I thought that everyone was probably having a hard time finding a job.

I know this has been asked before but I'd like some advice on specific software. I am an electrical engineering student going into my last year in september. I didn't land a summer internship so I have a free summer. I'm thinking of learning a few programs and i'd like some advice.

Firstly i'm thinking of taking the [Microsoft office specialist certification](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/mos-certification.aspx#fbid=b_oxLnKe2DP). I figure that if i have a certification it will look better on my resume and i would have more credentials at using the software. I'm not sure if employers would overlook this and if its worth the 100$ to take the exam.

Secondly is AutoCad. From all the job postings i've come across, this program is great for general engineering. My university doesn't offer classes on how to use AutoCad so I'm just going to read a book and take the certification exam as well. same as above, worth it? or just say i've read this book entirely and I have a sound knowledge of how to use the program.

I want to specialize in Power engineering, and i've been looking for software that power engineers specifically use. I'm looking at SKM, ETAP, and EDSA. I have a general understanding of what ETAP is but the other two I have no clue. I did a bit of googling and it seems like there isn't a lot of info on any of these programs. Are these programs outdated? and if not are there any good resources to learn? I looked at the etap training website and i can't afford 2 grand to learn how to use it.

I'm also looking into SQL database and maybe C++ or Java. are these good to learn for Power engineering?

tldr: would getting a certification for Microsoft office specialist and AutoCAD make a big difference on a resume, and are SKM, ETAP and Edsa outdated software? what about SQL database and C++ or Java."

But most companies don't even respond to my applications. Most of them I've been just applying through the internet. I customize each resume, each cover letter, have people proofread my entire application, and nothing. 

I've attended a bunch of networking events in my industry to meet people and advertised career fairs. People are very nice but it never seems to go anywhere.

I've tried randomly messaging people on linkedin for informational interviews and nobody will respond. That seemed like a dead-end route.

I've tried searching through my school's job boards but again, nothing comes through. Most companies still don't respond.

I need a suit!

I have been browsing/lurking in MFA for quite a few months now, and have the basics down, understand fit fairly well, etc. etc. One thing I'm not great with is suits because there was never any need!

Ordinarily, I would just go by myself and get something. However, my father wants to do the whole ""help son buy first suit"" thing. This means a lot to me. However, there's a problem: my dad is a mediocre dresser, and even when he does well, his style is very conservative, which does not jive with my style at all. Furthermore, he is difficult to shop with. He adopts a ""I've been dressing myself for over 40 years and you're 19, therefore I know better"" attitude, which results in endless suggestions of boxy, badly fitting suits.

A proven way for me to combat this is to have alternative suggestions at the ready, with reasons explaining why I think A would be better than B. 

Here comes the question: Where should I look for suits? My dad said he would pay for an average suit at JCP or Macy's or something, which I estimate to be around $175. I am fine with this, and I would be willing to chip in up to $75-$100 to get it tailored or buy a slightly nicer suit or both, so total budget for the suit (including tailoring) is around $250. I realize this isn't much but it's what I've got.

Stores in my area (Frederick, MD) are ridiculously limited: JCP, Macy's, Sear's, Express, Men's Wearhouse Jos. A. Bank, etc. Pretty terrible.

40 minutes away is a slightly better mall. The store listing is here: http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/store_listing.asp?id=100

Stores that jump out from there are Banana Republic factory, Brooks Brothers factory, Calvin Klein, J. Crew, Polo factory, and Tommy Hilfiger.

Out of the stores listed, where should I look? I need a really concise and thought-out list in order to convince my dad to even look somewhere besides Sear's or Jos. A. Bank...Also, he doesn't like online shopping so that's out the window.

I am 5' 11"", 180 lbs., muscular with a large drop. 

I'm looking for a versatile charcoal suit. I have nice dark brown dress shoes.

Let me know if any other information is necessary. Thanks!"

1dt01r,1,2013-05-06,Can't decide what to do about my marriage [29m/28f],neversure42,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dt01r/cant_decide_what_to_do_about_my_marriage_29m28f/,"My wife and I have been together for about 5 years now. We got married two years ago. This is my second marriage; I had an ill-advised first marriage when I was way too young that ended after about 10 months. No kids.

I don't even know how to start this. Things seemed really great when we met and for the first few years I was incredibly happy and in love. It only seemed to get bad around the time we got married.

We got married by a judge at the courthouse, mainly to get her on my insurance with a ""proper"" ceremony to follow. People found out about this (my fault) and this ruined her expectation of a ""proper"" ceremony so we never had one. Resentment built up over this for a long time. A year later, she was late getting home one night and acting suspicious. I glanced over at her phone and she was texting a male coworker. After a long string of denials, I found out she had a romantic interest in this guy. She had been giving him rides to work for a while.

What followed was the most emotionally painful period of time I have ever endured. She kept telling me she was done with this guy, then I'd find out she was still seeing him. It went on for a couple months. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and I asked her to move out. She wanted to call it a ""separation"" and not a divorce because she didn't feel ready to let go of me just yet. While she was moved out, she started seeing two additional guys. 

Now, all of this behavior is crazy and way out of character for her. She had always been a kind, empathic, sweet person, and I never would have thought she was capable of hurting me this badly. She had been having trouble with anxiety in grad school and had started seeing a psychiatrist who put her on an astounding variety of things: Klonopin, xanax, lamictal, wellbutrin, in addition to vicodin, soma and ritalin her regular doctor was prescribing her and a daily weed habit (she was high pretty much any time she wasn't at school or work, and sometimes went to those things high too.) I felt at the time like she was on so much stuff that she just wasn't herself. She wrecked her car twice during this period. She had always had a tendency to smoke too much weed and I never thought she needed the vicodin or ritalin prescriptions, but she seemed to manage that stuff pretty well. The other stuff just sent her into a tailspin, I think. 

A big part of the pain from this period of time was how worried I was about her. I knew she was on way too much medication and I worried that she would get taken advantage of, or would destroy her career, or would flat out die in a car wreck. It wasn't even about wanting her back, it was about wanting her to be healthy and safe.

Fast forward a few months. I make a decision that I am done with her and ask her for a divorce, in the same week that she finds out she's going to have to go to Colorado for an internship. She tells me that when she pictures herself starting a new life there, she pictures me with her, that she loves me and misses me, and she wants me to come with her.

I think about it (shit, I've always wanted to move to Colorado anyway) and tell her that if she gets off all the drugs I'll do it. She agrees and spends the summer weaning off of everything. I thought maybe a fresh start would be good for both of us. So we move to Colorado, and we've been here for about a year now. Things seem much more stable; she still probably smokes too much weed, but she's off all the other crap, and I don't believe she's still cheating. She seems genuinely remorseful for the things that happened and she's seeing a therapist to try to deal with the parts of herself that led her to do these things.

The thing is, it seems like something within me has changed. I remember the way I felt about her when I proposed, how happy I was. I remember fantasizing about the children we could have, about growing old together. I remember how proud of her I was, always talking up her grad school accomplishments. I don't feel those things anymore. I don't feel like I can trust her. I feel a lot of doubt and fear about the future. She wants to have children soon and I just don't know; I feel like I would need to see a lot more stability from her, for a long period of time, before I could think about bringing a child into this.

I think that if we weren't married, if she was just my girlfriend, I would dump her and leave. But since we're married, and especially because this is my second marriage, it seems like a much harder decision. I don't want to admit defeat and give up on it. I desperately want it to work, but I'm not sure I will ever feel the same way about her again, not sure I will ever be able to trust her. I'm not sure if those feelings will ever come back, or how long I should wait for them. And I want to keep my word. And I don't want the stigma of being twice-divorced.

I've sent out about 50 applications for entry level MechE jobs, in the last 2 weeks, and I haven't heard back from any of them yet. I include cover letters after researching the companies I'm applying to. I've tried to call and check up on a few of the more promising positions, but I'm still finding nothing.


A little background. I didn't care as much about my GPA as I should have my first 2 years, and now even though my upper division GPA is a 3.33, my cumulative is only a 2.81. I also lacked the foresight to get any internships. It's funny in a cruel kind of way, because whenever I mention that I'm still searching to my class mates I always get the same response: ""But you're a genius. Really? You're like, the smartest person I know."" Well, guess not. Turns out I'm an idiot. 


On the other hand, I might be making some headway in networking. I've wanted to work in aerospace since I was 8. I helped found my university's AIAA branch as the membership chair, and now I'm the Vice Chairman. Because of the sudden renewed interest in AIAA at our university we started putting on a ton of guest speaker and dinner events, and now Sacramento is the fastest growing AIAA branch in the nation. The guys who work at the local aerospace companies like AeroJet and CEI love us, but unfortunately I'm not sure how to broach the subject of ""Hey, I'm graduating in a few weeks, and I'm desperate for an interview."" Calling them out of the blue feels like it would be tactless.


If I don't find a job by June 15 I'll need to move back home to Clements, CA. That's something I'd like to avoid at all costs, since it's just vineyards as far as the eye can see, and no internet. I once saw a guy walk into the local diner with sunglasses on, and end up with the nickname ""Hollywood"".  Really, at this point I'd relocate to the middle of the Sahara Desert as long as the salary was competitive. 


The long term plan is if I don't find something within 6 months I'll just go into the Air Force for a few years and get some experience under my belt.

I am currently a rising senior from the University of Maryland, College Park in the Mechanical Engineering program.  I absolutely love it here, but I'm stuck in an interesting dilemma.  

I have been applying for internships for almost 2 years now, and have never gotten a call back for an internship.  I have contacted the majority of the companies by phone and email to ""check in"", but gotten no response from that either.  Exams are literally a week away, and I'm getting really tired of hearing nothing back from employers.

Do you have any advice?  I would love to start working and applying what I have learned in school to the real world, but I have not yet gotten a chance.  Thoughts?

Thanks!

1dsvit,109,2013-05-06,"I'm (20F) currently dating the man (42M) who ""molested"" me when I was much younger. AMA",confessHer,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1dsvit/im_20f_currently_dating_the_man_42m_who_molested/,"I say ""molested"" in quotes because while I'm sure that's what most people would call it that I didn't feel taken advantage of or harmed at all when our first relationship began. That later changed and I have hated him for years. Now we're dating again and all my friends know about it is that I'm dating a much older man. Let me try to explain.

When I was eleven years old my best friend's parents were divorced. She spent every other weekend at her dad's house and sometimes I spent the weekend there with her. His place was outside of the city, a small horse farm with riding horses, goats, a five minute walk from a lake, really nice place. So much different than the city.

Mr. Dean was really cool too. He would bring us out for ice cream, let us just wander his property without constantly checking up on us, that sort of thing. He treated us like mature adults not little kids and I loved that. I even told him that once one night after my friend had fallen asleep. That's when he gave me his YIM ID and said that if I ever needed to talk to an adult about something I didn't want my parents to know about, he'd be there for me.

So we became YIM buddies. I kept this secret from everyone, including my friend, because like Mr. Dean said his daughter might think he's using me to spy on her (he did ask about her a lot: how was her home life, was she happy in school, things like that). As for my parents he pointed out that they wouldn't understand how a girl my age and a man his age could be friends. That much was definitely true, my parents were very over-protective. So he was my secret friend and I thought it was really cool to have a grown man as a friend, especially one who was always complimenting me so much and telling me how special I was. It wasn't long before I developed a crush on him.

It took me awhile to realize he was flirting with me. Thinking back about it I now realize he had been flirting from the start but at eleven years of age I had little self confidence, especially with older boys and men, and just couldn't believe a guy like Mr. Dean would be physically attracted to me. That changed when he found out from his daughter that we had taken my parents new digital camera out for a school project, probably hinting she wanted one for herself (she was always trying to get him to buy her things). When he asked me about it online I said that yes, my parents had a new digital camera and it was awesome. That's when he asked me to take some ""special pictures"" of myself for him.

He didn't ask for nudes at first, only pix of me in my underwear. I remember being so embarrassed when he asked for that. But he explained it would make him feel special to know that I trusted him enough with such pictures especially if I was taking them only for him. So one day I relented and took about a dozen pictures of me in my nicest undies, all while making ridiculously silly poses due to my embarrassment, and sent them to his e-mail account.

After that things began to escalate really fast. He sent me a picture of his penis with the title ""Look what your pictures did to me!"". He then asked me for nudes and by now I was feeling older and sophisticated so I complied. He started asking me if I ever touched myself (I did) and then if I ever thought of him while I touched myself (I did). That led us to full on Internet sex. He then started providing me with passwords to (legal) porn websites, asking me to watch various videos and then chat about them. 

Basically within two months of beginning our online friendship he was turning me into his personal little pervert girl. And I was happy to be that for him, I wanted to make him happy. Whenever I disappointed him he would disappear for a few days and when he came back I would be so relieved that I would do anything I could to make sure he didn't do that again. He was manipulating me like a master psychologist or something which isn't much of a stretch: I eventually learned that he went to grad school for a masters in social work and then interned for awhile as a adolescent psychologist. He never finished the internship because his stay at home business really took off and he ended up focusing on that exclusively. But still he had the skills. He knew how to turn a bratty tirade of mine into the exactly conversation he wanted within minutes. He especially knew how to use my insecurities and desire to please him to his advantage.

That's what led to our first real sexual encounter. I was almost twelve now and he said that it was time for us to spend some real time together. He came up with the whole plan and then one day after school I met him at a nearby gas station and he brought me back to his farm for the night. My parents thought I was at a sleepover at another friend's house. He had a cell phone that he'd given me the number for to give for them. When they called later that evening, which of course they did, he answered and pretended to be my mystery friend's father. We ended up using the fake friend throughout the course of our relationship with my parents never figuring out that she didn't exist.

He started things off with me slow, very slow. I'd never even kissed a boy before and he knew that. He also knew how extremely nervous I was. That first time we basically just made out but we did both spend pretty much all of that night naked. He fingered me to what I mistakenly thought was an orgasm and then he showed me how to reciprocate by jacking him off. 

After that night we started seeing each other a lot more often. I lost my virginity to him shortly after my 12th birthday. We ended up ""dating"" like that for about two years. During that time he really messed with my head as much as he did with my body. He explained that promiscuity was a natural thing and that I shouldn't turn into people like my parents who saw sex as this dirty, evil thing. He actualy encouraged me to be with other boys and that's what I did in my stupid attempt to please him. I got pregnant when I was thirteen, most likely from a boy from my neighborhood. After the abortion my parents cracked down on me even more than ever so it was awhile before I could see Mr. Dean again. But we saw each other most nights, online, sharing pictures of each other and talking about the most perverted things imaginable. He once convinced me to try and seduce my older brother which led to his disgust and horror and a threat to tell our parents. When I tried again due to Mr. Dean's insistence he followed through on his threat and my parents put me into therapy. That was the beginning of the end of my relationship with Mr. Dean.

Up until two months ago I've hated him for what he did to me. He definitely abused me, both physically and mentally. He made me love him but convinced me through subtle means that I wasn't really worthy of love myself. He exposed me to things no child should be exposed to and gave me a warped view of sexuality and relationships. 

And despite all that I am now dating him. For the last two months since randomly running into me at work we have been dating openly. He hasn't changed much either and I hate myself for being too weak to do the right thing and cut him off. But there's this part of me I can't explain that enjoys reliving the past. After a wild spree after the last time I saw Mr. Dean back when I was fourteen I had only been with two men in five years, both serious relationships. Sure I've been a bit of a party girl at times but I haven't been a slut, not until I started seeing Mr. Dean again two months ago. Now he's involved me in three three ways, all with different male friends of his, and one semi-gangbang.

None of my friends know about any of my recent behavior or the past Mr. Dean and I share. Outwardly he comes across as a normal, educated, very intelligent and polite man. Some of my friends initially questioned why I'd date someone old enough to be my father but all of them have come to accept him. Some are even jealous because he's extremely handsome and obviously very well off financially. He showers me with gifts and will be taking me to Puerto Rico next month for an entire week and he's paying for everything. All of my friends think he's a romantic and I let them believe that. But none of them know the truth of our past or what he is currently trying to return me to in the present: he wants me to be his doting little pervert girl again and he has been succeeding. Worst part is that I don't know if I want him to fail. Just the thought of him getting bored with me or something makes me upset. 

I'll try to read any questions you might have and answer them through this afternoon or if you just want to comment or give advice that's fine. If you viciously attack me for being a horrible person I'll just ignore you though."

I was a Liberal Arts Major at a respectable college. After graduating, I toured and worked on music for over 2 years, self-marketing and promoting myself. I handled every aspect of this and very much considered it my own small business, as it was the only income I lived off of for those 2 years. I decided I wanted to further my knowledge of the science behind recording and went back to school to get my Audio Engineering certificate. During this time I managed a locally owned restaurant. I have since been working as an accounting clerk and writing content for start-ups during the last year. 

I have since decided I want to go back to school to get my MBA to gain the fundamental knowledge needed to succeed in business. Marketing (and specifically Strategy) is what I want to to concentrate on. 


My questions are as follows:

1) With a solid undergrad GPA and GMAT score, am I looking at having a difficult time getting into an MBA program. What about getting scholarships? (I've been told that my non-traditional background will potentially help me since most schools allot x amount of spots for people like me to 'diversify' their programs.)

1dsnjs,0,2013-05-06,I am a salaried employee in NY state in the creative industry - am I getting taken advantage of?,dktrZERO,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dsnjs/i_am_a_salaried_employee_in_ny_state_in_the/,"Well, I should clarify. I know I'm getting taken advantage of - but is it legal?

I work for a pretty famous artist, and his attitude towards employees basically boils down to ""you should be happy to work for me"". There are about 8 full time employees in all, and usually around 6 unpaid interns.
I am the studio manager, and work very closely with him in all things. I am on salary, which in this case basically boils down to indentured servitude. Technically I work 9 - 6, monday through friday, but this is never the case.

On an average day, I actually work more like 8 - 8. When he is in the studio, we regularly work until 10 or 11. We are also expected to work most weekends and holidays. On average I have maybe 4 days off a month if I'm lucky.

We are paid no overtime. We are offered no health insurance. We do not get a lunch break - we order in or send interns out, and eat at our desks while we work. The compensation for working weekends is 1 comp day off for every 2 days worked. We are repeatedly informed about what a great gift this is, since they are not legally obligated to do so.

Now I'm sure a lot of you will tell me I just need to find a new job, which is certainly true, but in the mean time, and for the sake of my coworkers who have less experience than me - how legal is this business practice? Can they really work us 70-80 hours a week for the same compensation as the 45 hour week we are supposed to have? Is there no situation in which my employer has to offer or at least help with health insurance? Are mandatory weekends and holidays really something they can force on us without recompense?"

I know I'm getting taken advantage of - but is it legal?

I work for a pretty famous artist, and his attitude towards employees basically boils down to ""you should be happy to work for me"". There are about 8 full time employees in all, and usually around 6 unpaid interns.

I am the studio manager, and work very closely with him in all things. I am on salary, which in this case basically boils down to indentured servitude. Technically I work 9 - 6, monday through friday, but this is never the case.

On an average day, I actually work more like 8 - 8. When he is in the studio, we regularly work until 10 or 11. We are also expected to work most weekends and holidays. On average I have maybe 4 days off a month if I'm lucky.

We are paid no overtime. We are offered no health insurance. We do not get a lunch break - we order in or send interns out, and eat at our desks while we work. The compensation for working weekends is 1 comp day off for every 2 days worked. We are repeatedly informed about what a great gift this is, since they are not legally obligated to do so.

Now I'm sure a lot of you will tell me I just need to find a new job, which is certainly true, but in the mean time, and for the sake of my coworkers who have less experience than me - how legal is this business practice? Can they really work us 70-80 hours a week for the same compensation as the 45 hour week we are supposed to have? Is there no situation in which my employer has to offer or at least help with health insurance? Are mandatory weekends and holidays really something they can force on us without recompense?"

That should have been enough to close the case, right? Wrong! The father was ordered to produce more proof of his innocence, so he decided to test himself on a lie detector. The price of such a test was approximately US$8000, a huge sum for the Russian middle class. Obviously, the guy was nervous, which could be observed in the results.

I ended up starting some kind of thesis on it and acquired broad theoretical knowledge on the subject. Lately I've been interested in Scala for some reason. I didn't know anything about functional languages so far so I guess seeing it working along OOP was intriguing as well.
Anyway I've been toying around, reading and such and I'd really like to bring it one step further, which is really learn both subjects. So my questions are : Is it really worth to commit myself on this ? Will it bring me something more when looking for a job ? Are there even companies that would be willing to hire a junior for these technologies (worldwide, but especially in Europe and France) or should I go for a more traditional job first ?

4 months ago I was talking on skype with my best friend and her boyfriend. Her boyfriend invited someone else to the conversation, because we were all gaming together. From the first time I heard his voice, he stirred something inside of me. I had been in a relationship for 4 years, but that guy dumped me and I've been single now for 2 years. Anyways, I wanted to meet this guy in real life and when my best friend said we'd all go out together he said he had to leave on a foreign internship for 3 months (at the other side of the globe). I've waited impatiently for him to get back and last month he finally returned. I couldn't stop thinking about him. My best friend held her birthdayparty yesterday and she also invited him. So it was the first time I actually met him in person. I was incredibly attracted to him. Now, the big problem is: he is unbelievably shy and because of that I cannot ""read"" him. I'm shy as well, so I don't dare to talk to him. Mostly because I'm afraid that he'll find me pushy. When I saw him yesterday he hadn't said anything to me as well. I'd like to go out with him some more, but I don't want to annoy him or give him the image that I'm a pushy person (which I'm not). Does anyone have any advice about the situation? If you need more information, I'll try to provide it. (Sorry for typo's / grammatical errors, I'm not a native speaker). 

TLDR; extremely shy guy I like, but he doesn't say a word and I'm afraid he'll misinterpret me if I start talking to him.

1ds9jq,2,2013-05-06,A month in! Review,187ThrowAway,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1ds9jq/a_month_in_review/,"Hello!

Let me introduce myself, Im 20 years old and I i've been PMO since I was about 13 or so.
Thinking about I used to fap frequently but haven't ever seen this as a problem, I thought it was very healthy etc.

I then recently stumbled upon Nofap a while ago, I didn't have that much PMO problems but took the challenge to see what would happen.

I've been busy lately with an internship and go to the gym 4-5 times a week (Not this week because I busted my knee's :/) and found out that I didn't really fap that much anymore, during weekdays I would be away from the PC constantly in the evening, I would get home from work, go to the gym and chill out with friends. (Im a programmer, so when I'm at work I sit behind the pc all the time, when I would get home I didn't want to sit behind the pc for the evening aswell) 

I stumbled upon this reddit and started reading some posts here a bit over a month ago. I then found out that whenever I've got hardly anything to do (Sundays anyone?) that I would be triggered faster to fap. I started reading all these reviews about people giving up PMO making themselves a better person, with other benefits etc. I didn't fap that regulary anymore because of I was quite busy and I would only fap when i've got nothing to do. 
So I thought lets accept the challenge and see where it brings me! Im also doing the challenge the Hard Mode. (No girlfriend, but working on this girl! hope it works out :}) 

The first few weeks I would find myself glancing/looking up some pictures (gonewild) or sometimes even porn. I then would realise what i'm doing and click it away! I didn't give in to edging. 

For the last two weeks i haven't really been that horny at all to be honest and i'm not thinking about fapping either. I hope my sexdrive isn't killed (Probably flatlining right!?)

As of all these superpowers people are thinking about. I haven't found real benefits yet, besides beeing more energetic (Not the after fap lazyness anymore haha)  I do hope I see more of these benefits as I get a longer streak.


So there it is, today I haven't masturbated for a month and i'm feeling pretty good, besides the fact that im flatlining (Not sure whether this is good or bad...) Up to a longer streak!


I hope people out there will read this post! This community has been a really good place, reading xx day reviews and all has been inspiring! 
Thanks already."

However, that means they know my reddit username, and thus had a lot of access to my comment history, etc... see where this might be going?",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1ds5sr/i_was_asked_for_my_resume_in_a_reddit_message/,"I'm using a throwaway, for reasons very inherent to my question.

My main account is active on a medium sized subreddit, and also manages a smaller subreddit related to the company in question. Members from the company post there (either low level employees who like the brand, or even one or two upper-level PR/marketing people).

I had messaged one of the upper level people asking about what internships at the company were like, and they gave me information and seemed pretty enthusiastic. I didn't express any interest besides that. 

Then, a few weeks ago, I got a mesasge from the person saying that the company wanted to use reddit in the future, and asked for my resume so they could forward it to the marketing department.

I was pretty excited. It was an opportunity to intern at a company I really liked, and do something I was really interested in (marketing, and if it involved reddit? dream internship right there)

So, I sent my resume, and they forwarded it. The next day, I got a message from the marketing person asking if I wanted to having a meeting or do a phone call (meeting = interview, I assume). I explained I couldn't meet until two weeks, but said I would love to have a phone conversation.

I sent that last reply on Thursday last week. Okay, it's only been a few days, so I should chill, right? But it made me concerned in another way:

I realized that since I was initially contacted on reddit, they most **certainly** knew my reddit username, and thus had access to a large reddit history, full of a bunch of, well, random bullshit reddit comments. (this is assuming that the person who forwarded my resume also shared my username or history with this other member of the company)

I don't think anything was specifically incriminating, however I'm concerned that my 'reddit attitude' or other posting behaviors might paint a poor picture of myself.

The question is, do you think a company would take advantage of my history to gauge my character? It's essentially my anonymous account, so it feels a bit.. cheap.. but still, I know that my behavior on reddit is probably the most unfiltered representation of who I am, to some degree.

I've been sweating over this recently, as the internship was something I was really looking forward to. I wouldn't want some random internet bullshit to jeopardize it. 

Do you think a company would look through my history as part of the hiring process? What importance would they place on it? Would they put it in the context of it being an anonymous account, or see it as the most accurate representation of my character?

I love messing around (trolling? I don't see it that way. It's just a specific type of humor). I like being blunt, and arguing points. However, I take a great pride in being respectful and balanced, but still, it's inconsistent, and when it blends with my other kinds of humor it can be hard to differentiate.

If there are any professional-oriented people (hiring managers, etc) I would be willing to pm you the account in question, and you can see my comment history and look for big red flags or anything of the like. I'd actually really appreciate that, as an outside perspective would be really nice.

Damn, I write a lot. sorry. and thanks!

I am a freshman at a state school with no security courses taught here nor any active security groups. I am trying to get a couple of students together to start in a CTF team, but I really don't know what I am doing in that regard. We do have a decently ranked CS program in light of not having any security specific classes.

* I am a good CS student; to the point where I have tested out of classes and have been approved for taking grad courses next year
* I would like to either be a software engineer or a pen tester after I graduate, and would like to know how to best prepare for pen testing since I have the SE part covered with past experience.
* I have a SE internship at a fortune 100 tech company in a hardware group (nothing to do with security) and I'm wondering how I should approach the security departments at said company to express my interest and possibly be invited to join their team next summer if I am given the opportunity.
* As far as I know, there are only two pen testing orgs that operate in my state
* I have WAHH 2, CEH study guide (v7 I believe), quite a few Cisco books for CCNP and CCNA which I will probably study for, but not take the exams. I like having knowledge even if I don't have the certs. Quite a few other books in security from lock picking to SQL injection (more advanced topics of SQL injection, not really beginner topics except the first couple of chapters).
* I have recently gotten into a lot of trouble at my university for ""hacking"" their registration system (I basically just bypassed part of the system to register for classes early) so they will probably not be too happy if I try to organize a CTF team or an infosec club on campus because I received a total of 68 months of probation from various departments on campus.
* I am also interested in malware analysis and have done a lot of this on .NET and Java malware in years past. I am very proficient in Java bytecode. This could be another avenue of work I may pursue, but I am at a loss for what goes into getting into this field.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/WRZpPwB.jpg) picture was drawn by 7 year old girl at school. Child psychologist (female) claimed that this cat-girl has distinctive breasts and thighs, therefore the girl is sexually active; and the tail is erect, so it clearly means she was raped by a male. (On a side note: this psychologist's account in one of social networks has photos of her in BDSM outfits. Clearly a suitable person to be working with kids)

When the girl was taking into hospital for examination, interns claimed that there were dead spermatozoa in her urine, and so they informed the police. Additional examination had to be done, so the girl was sent to another clinic with special equipment, where doctors established that there are no traces of sexual activity and the girl is a virgin. 

It should have been enough to close the case, right? Wrong! The father had to produce more proof of his innocence, so he decided to test himself on a lie detector. The price of such test was approximately $8000, a huge sum for Russian middle class, but he needed it anyway. Obviously, the guy was nervous, which could be observed in the results. But the result was not good enough to prove anything, so he was offered another test for $16000, which he did not have. He has been proven guilty and is now serving 13 years.

Dated for three years, two of the years were LDR.  I love her, and I feel she makes me feel happier then I have ever felt by myself or with another girl.

Problem is I'm in medical school about to be MS2 (2nd year).  I have two years of schooling left and then three years of residency.  She's in California and I'm in New York.  I want her to move in with me in a year.   She wants to but she is too afraid of her family.  She still live at home and still needs permission to go go hang out on weekends and no overnight trips.

Its frustrating.  Waiting.... I don't know when we will start our life together.  She says she definitely will in three years when I start my residency (mandatory internship for doctors).

I mean a 1 year wait compared to 3 years seem like nothing in the scheme of things, but emotionally I'm frustrated.  Part of me wants to end it when I get back after finals in 16 days.  Other part of me says she is worth the wait.  I'm more frustrated at her inability to stand up to family.  If she didn't want to go to NY and wants me to comeback to California, I will be fine with it.  Problem is she does want to go to NY, but she ""can't"". 

I tell her this and she say wait for a year and see how it goes.  She is trying to summon courage to move out first in an apartment 15mins away from home.  Problem is she had apartment for two months and still haven't told family yet.

I can't fault her family, since her dad died when she was 6, brother raised her practically.  So he is really protective of her.  Talking about juggling jobs in high school and college to support family type of sacrifice.

Any advice?"
1ds175,1,2013-05-06,"[25m] in a long distance relationship with my gf [21f], need some perspective",tk42121,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ds175/25m_in_a_long_distance_relationship_with_my_gf/,"I've been in a long distance relationship with my GF for about 9 months (2 months close distance). We met when we were both doing a summer internship on the east coast (I'm from the west coast). She was actually in a relationship when we met, but from what I heard of it, it sounded like he wasn't very nice, cheated on her all the time, took advantage of her financially. Her main complaint though was that he ""just was never that in to her"". They dated for 3 years.

Anyways, when we met, sparks just flew and we hooked up after being friends for a few weeks. She felt terrible though, being a relationship at the time, and after we talked it through, she broke up with her ex. Despite rocky beginnings, things were amazing and we had the best summer together. So much so that despite my own bad experiences with long distance relationships, I told her that I wanted to still be with her despite the 3000 mile distance, especially when she is graduating school in a year and said she'd likely come move out to where I was. Things went well over these past months, and she's planning on moving to the west coast with me in the new few months, I got a great new job in SF. 

Here's the *but* part. She's very pretty, young, and likes to have fun, which is all great, but I get put in a really bad mood sometimes when she goes out drinking to the point of blacking/browning out, and I don't hear from her for several hours. She tells me everything that can remember the next day usually and it doesn't happen often, but I've expressed before how it makes me uncomfortable and that conversation quickly spiraled into one about how I was being controlling and she said it made her feel like withdrawing and not sharing as much with me. Recently, she felt compelled to re-facebook-friend her ex, who lives somewhat nearby and comes to party and pick up female students on occasion. This past weekend when she was out, she was very inebriated, saw him kissing another girl, tapped him on the shoulder, and told him to ""have just a little tiny bit of respectful"" since he knew she was in the same bar. From what she told me, they ended up talking outside for 30 minutes, she was crying and didn't remember most of it, but said she told him that she was very happy being with me.

Anways, given all that, I still get really put off by the whole situation at times, and it's really affecting me. We fought today over something inconsequential just because I was in such a bad mood about it. I haven't brought up that topic directly, even if she probably suspects that is the case since she knows I am not my usual happy self when stuff like that happens. Am I truly just being too controlling and should just chill out? I am hoping to get some perspective here. Thanks for listening to this long winded rant!

tl;dr Not comfortable with my GF drinking to the point of blacking out around her ex-bf, brought it up once before and was called overbearing."

1drug0,1,2013-05-05,Transgender Fundraiser,tufforg,fundraiser,https://www.reddit.com/r/fundraiser/comments/1drug0/transgender_fundraiser/,"My name is Jacob Rostovsky, I'm a 22 year old transgender male, student and Point Foundation scholar who is working on getting their non-profit off the ground. As you may know, getting a non-profit started can be really difficult, and has many expenses. As a college student, all of my finances are spent to pay for classes and books. I’m currently working 40 hours a week at a non-paid internship, so I cannot have any other source of income.

Ever since I transitioned at 14 years old, I knew that I wanted to dedicate my life to helping the transgender community in all possible ways. I know my soon to be non-profit, TUFF, will change the transgender community and help to better so many lives, especially those of our at risk youth.

TUFF (Trans United with Family and Friends) needs help getting its 501c and raising money for supplies to outreach to the community! You can help!!
Since I was fifteen, I've wanted to work in the transgender community, trying to help individuals less fortunate than I was. Realizing how expensive transition is, and how many insurance companies don't cover anything in that area, I knew someone had to help those who couldn't afford to transition.

I've realized that once a person medically transitions, their entire life changes. They are happier, confident and hopeful, and for some people this is the first time in their lives they've felt like this. I don't want anyone to be held back from giving the world their all and reaching their full potential just because they can't afford to transition.

What is TUFF? TUFF is a non-profit organization, based in Los Angeles, that gives financial assistance to transgender and gender variant individuals, and can be used towards the cost of transition and medical needs. The money is distributed on an as needed basis. Recipients must apply for an award, and are chosen based on their financial need, personal, social, and advocacy goals for the future.

Who can apply for funds? Anyone who identifies along the transgender/gender variant spectrum, regardless of their financial needs. Applicants must fill out an application form that requires them to provide information about their medical transition history and financial needs. They must also submit 2 essays that ask about their future goals and involvement within the transgender/gender variant community.
What is this fundraiser going to help TUFF with? Right now, as executive director and founder of TUFF, I am using my own funds to pay to file paper work, purchase fliers, buttons and posters and travel across the countries to various conferences and workshops to spread the word about TUFF. As a college student, using my own income has proven to be extremely difficult and hard, especially when I also need to fund my education. By donating to this fundraiser, you can help launch TUFF and fulfill my dream of running and creating this non-profit. 

I know that left and right there are campaigns online asking you to donate. But know, this is an extremely important cause that can help save thousands of lives.
I ask that you spread this message to anyone you see fit, and to help get the word of my fundraiser out there.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and thank you in advance for your donation,

Jacob Rostovsky

I know that a lot is going on for the order right now, but I have a personal matter I must attend to. One of my best friends growing up is in a bit of trouble. He was always considered extremely bright (sometimes too bright for his own good) and he just finished his uni education. He began an internship job at a local up and coming pharmaceutical company that turns out to be a Templar child company.

His family says he's been spending a lot of time working for a few months, and is rarely home. When he is, he's seclusive and irritable. They're afraid for him. They don't know what I do, but I told his parents I'll try to help. I'm doing this for his girlfriend especially, because she was a personal friend of ours in school.

The company is giving a party in celebration of a successful new experiment, and I plan to get in and learn about what they're doing as well as help out my friend Mark.

Suggestions appreciated!  

**My Self Summary:**

I love living and think that life is even better when shared.

**What I’m doing with my life:**

I'm a *(state here)* native who's been away for a while. I've just now moved back to *(city here)* to start work as a surgery intern.

**I’m really good at:**

Basic household maintenance. I don't mind getting my hands dirty, and I think that there is no more important tool than a good pair of vise-grips. I like being useful.

Detailed woodworking. I love doing fretwork, and I'm teaching myself bevel-sawn inlay now.

Compartmentalizing. It's been a horrible day with 7 trauma patients in the ORs? No problem; the day is over and I'm going home to cook dinner and enjoy a little peace.


Keeping calm. I'm pretty good at differentiating between things that really matter and things I can just let slide.


**The first things people usually notice about me:**
I'm usually confident but reservedly polite around people I don't know well. I'm much more open around friends.


**Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food:**

Literature:
Classics, mostly. A Tale of Two Cities, Bleak House, The Sound and the Fury, The Ones who Walk Away from Omelas, Fahrenheit 451, Stranger in a Strange Land, etc.. Some other authors that I've found I enjoy: George Carlin, Stephen King, Michael Crichton, Christopher Hitchens, HP Lovecraft, Douglas Adams, Neil Gaiman, Orson Scott Card. My most recently finished book at this writing is ""The Greatest Generation,"" by Tom Brokaw.

Movies:
Cool Hand Luke, American Beauty, The Usual Suspects, V for Vendetta, Contact, The Shawshank Redemption, Almost Famous, The Cider House Rules, Donald in Mathmagic Land, Up and Ratatouille (Pixar), and more esoteric films like Brick, Winter's Bone, and The Man From Earth. Categorically, I really don't like horror movies (I don't like films whose purpose is to make me feel uncomfortable).

Shows:
Of all time: The West Wing, Band of Brothers, Firefly, The Wire.
Still on the air: Mythbusters, Dexter, Sherlock, The Walking Dead.

Music:
Classic rock (think Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd, and The Doors) and modern rock (MGMT, Goo Goo Dolls, Counting Crows, etc.), really just about anything with a good melody.

Other:
Reddit, in healthy moderation and with careful customization.

**On a typical Friday night I am:**
Trying a recipe I've never made before, and enjoying quiet discussions with friends over a card or board game, or studying, or watching a movie on my computer, or candlepin bowling with buddies I've had since middle school, or reading a book.


**The most private thing I’m willing to admit:**

Despite very much enjoying certain whiskeys, I have never been drunk. (I don't hold it against anyone who enjoys drinking, I just like people who are responsible and don't act like idiots when they imbibe.)

**I’m looking for**

    Girls who like guys
    Ages 23–26
    Near me
    Who are single
    For new friends, long-term dating, short-term dating, activity partners

**You should message me if:**

Inclinations: message me if you're mature, courteous, responsible, and a good person. If we're compatible, you're smart and love to think and to talk. And devotion matters most. I put a lot of effort into the relationships I care about; I'm looking for someone whose values are like my own.

Physical: I'm in pretty good shape and I'm very active. A relationship with someone overweight would not work out.

Religion: I'm not at all religious. If religion is a big part of your life, you might want to find someone else.

Finally, I'll talk to absolutely anyone, and I'm always happy to have new friends (everyone can teach me something!). And if you find me before I find you, take the initiative and message me!

(Activity partners: message me! I'd love a hiking or tennis partner with a flexible schedule, and moving to *city name*, I'm up for just about anything else as well.)"
1drpxj,1,2013-05-05,"I've been diagnosed with ADHD and depression, but I think I might just be bipolar. Help!",loveis_,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1drpxj/ive_been_diagnosed_with_adhd_and_depression_but_i/,"So I'll try to keep this brief. My mom thought I was bipolar as soon as 12-13 but never brought me to a doctor. Now I'm in college and trying to figure myself out...

When I was a teenager, I was kind of a psycho. Sometimes really depressed, sometimes really happy, sometimes super bitchy (although that was generally just at home). My depression has definitely been present more than my other state, and my brother also has depression. But unlike him, who is quiet most of the time and very introverted, I am at times incredibly outgoing, fun, and extremely talkative. My thoughts are definitely rapid, too. I was way too into weed these past few months (I've stopped for an upcoming internship and drug test) and used to use it when I was stressed or sad because it made me feel a lot better. My schoolwork is inconsistent; when I do it at peak, I get near perfect grades, but my overall averages are usually not so hot because I'll miss some assignments or not finish them. 

All of that seems to be pretty symptomatic for bipolar disorder, BUT since I've gotten older, I don't get very irritable, nor do I ever feel incredibly elated. However, I took some serious control of my moods and life over the last five years and I think I've just forced myself to calm down. Sounds crazy, but I still feel impulsive needs to act irrationally, I just don't ever do it. 

I feel good at times, really good. Confident, silly, etc, but I don't lose touch with reality or do things that are THAT dangerous. I can be promiscuous at times, and I get bored of relationships very quickly. I've never actually dated anyone longer than two months. 

So here's what confuses me. My 'manic' side doesn't seem to be as extreme as what I've found online describing that state, but it is drastically different from my depressed side. 

I'm NOT looking for a diagnosis, just some feedback from who are bipolar. Does my situation sound more like depression with normal mood or bipolar, or something else altogether? 

FYI, I plan on talking to my doctor ASAP, but it's a Sunday and I didn't want to wait. "

Here are my failures in convenient list form:

* No internships or Co Ops (yet)
* Mediocre low GPA (below 3.0) 
* No connections of any sort
* Economy is fairly tanked and here in the North East there isn't too many open positions. All entry/intern/coop position require 2-3 years experience. 
* No research positions available (and fairly late for that).

That pretty much covers it. As a chemical engineer I am behind the pack and it's extremely frustrating seeing how I am a fairly devoted student who mastered most topics and has excellent multidisciplinary knowledge. 

Anyway, before the downvoting begins, any advise from professional engineers? For example I realize that getting a license (FE for example) would be a great head start. "

I'm doing an internship out of state starting at the end of the month, so I have a 650 sq. ft. 1 bedroom/1 bath loft apartment available from around May 26- August 12 (negotiable).

1drh6p,4,2013-05-05,"Wiser redditors, How do I stop stagnating and stop wasting life? My life is going NO WHERE.",geeewee,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1drh6p/wiser_redditors_how_do_i_stop_stagnating_and_stop/,"My life isn't moving forward at all. I feel trapped in and I want to do something about it.

Please someone tell me how. 

A week ago my 22end birthday passed and even for being young I have not even done simple things people my age have done. I'm not depressed. I don't want to feel better, I want something to change. when I look objectively at my life it's just really bad, and yet I can't see my life improving.

I had a pretty bad childhood and grew up as a latch key kid with little support(I was an immigrant and my parents were usually busy), my childhood was filled with bullying and not fitting in due different background which caused some serious lack of self esteem, confidence issues, and inferiority complexes.

I'm currently not depressed at all but the state of my life has really been stagnate for the past few years. My life is generally tedious and uninteresting, yet I feel I'm not in any position to change anything about it. I want to get out of this but I feel like there's dead ends everywhere and it causes this immense feeling of extreme frustration and feeling of being trapped. 

I graduated HS 4 years ago now and I've been attending a small boring community college. I didn't feel passionate about anything and couldn't figure out what I wanted to do which caused some serious time wasting and bad grades. The place was packed and I often couldn't get any classes I needed which wasted a lot of time. I began taking classes I didn't need so I could acquire priority in registration. During my time at community college I often had extreme bouts of negative emotions, felt depressed, extremely lonely, bored, directionless, regretful. I withdrew from a lot of classes and this screwed me over. I had nothing to strive for, no goal, I was going through the motions, and began to have issues sleeping and started having awful grades, this kept going down in spiral. The campus was often empty, drab, and no one was around. There were no clubs. I just wanted to get out and I could not. I'm socially proficient, yet despite all attempts I found it extremely difficult to make friends at community college(due to the nature of the place).

I constantly feel like my failures eat up the present and destroy my future. everything constantly repeats.

I graduated HS without accomplishing a thing, without good memories, friends, or or any accomplishments. I couldn't get accepted into the university of my dreams and 4 years later I still can't.

I entered jr college full of regret, pain, and loneliness. I spent the first year without a single friends. Massive depression, massive regret, loneliness, my grades suffered. I was totally apathetic and unmotivated, and even suicidal. just wanted some friends. Loneliness was crushing. My eye was never on the ball, I didn't even know what to major in, I didn't know where I was going, where I wanted to transfer or anything. I was completely lost for years and in limbo, this lack of goals led to massive failure. I messed up in a lot of classes and could have passed many of them since the courses are easy as cake, but I've always had tons of problems, depression, massive insomnia, lack of motivation, loneliness, no girl, no friends, etc and withdrew a ton of classes. My GPA is awful, it's 2.9 and it's embarrassing. I can't even wake up in the morning. I have massive insomnia. I felt like a failure and still do.

-21 I finally decided on a major. My mood has stabilized significantly. I'm currently working towards my major of choice. I feel bad that I fucked up again, it feels like everything just keeps repeating itself. I've been aware of it for years but have no idea how to fix it. I just keep making the same mistakes again.

-22 During the last few years I put significant attention towards my social life, changing the way I dress, talking to people, becoming social. I'm an excellent socializer and extremely quick on my feet. I still have no new friends(due to the commuting nature of jr college) but I'm better with women. I still feel like a failure in my life though. I want to be successful.

I'm 22 and I don't have a degree. I don't even have a girlfriend. I even got a second chance to change my life when I entered jr college and I fucked up again.

I FEEL SO BEHIND in life. I have done NOTHING for the last four years, NOTHING. I don't know how to advance my life further.

I feel trapped in college. I just want to graduate and get out and have some sort of ""new"" accomplishment for myself. My life is not moving forward and I don't know what to do.

I spent the two years or so slowly improving myself even more, talking to people, dressing better, going to the gym every so often, but not much changed in my life. I still have only 3 friends and no social network to speak of. My weekends are spent at home, yet I highly dislike being at home all the time, I often feel VERY alone and VERY lonely. I did finally just recently find a girl and we went on a date, went well. I do look good on the outside and people often assume some very positive things about me(That I'm cool, have friends and that I'm intelligent and get good grades and have my life together), but the reality is I'm a failure. I often feel very odd when people compliment something positive about me.

--Compared to many people I am incredibly underdeveloped life experience/success wise for my age, yet at the same time I have the potential but no conducive environment for it. I'm not around anyone successful, I'm not around anyone my age who's doing something fun, or interesting, I don't have a group, there's no one for me to ""network"" off of. I'd love to get into a niche, or meet some person who's doing something interesting, or be in a place where something is happening. I'm still in the same town I was when I graduated, surrounded the same people, and experiencing the same things. I hate my life everyday. I have potential and but I'm not in the right places and around the right people............I'm just here......stuck.

Most people my age are living it up, having so much fun with their lives, yet I'm stuck here and experienced none of it. Fuck I haven't even gone to a real party yet, and I just recently got my first kiss. I'm so behind compared to the way people seem to generally view me, and it's really annoying. My lack of life experience makes me extremely frustrated. I'm wasting away my 20s and some of the best time of my life, where I have the time, youth, and energy.

In the last six months I finally settled on something for a major. I need about one more year till I transfer, at the same time that many of my peers are GRADUATING and getting internships and jobs and getting paid well. This is something that causes me a lot of turmoil. MY GPA IS AWFUL. it's 2.9. I won't be even going to an interesting university or experiencing anything new. I live a couple of miles from the school I will be going to.

My failure eats me up inside. I know it's not a race but I personally WANT to finish already, I can't bear being in the same situation any longer. I so badly want my life to ""start"" and I keep feeling like my life hasn't ""started"" yet. It's like big puzzle piece and I want the puzzle to finish but the goddamn fucking pieces aren't coming together and I can't make them together because they're just not there so I have to waste more of my life. A lot of those four years of life were completely wasted, I try not to dwell on the past but I'm still not going anywhere. I just wanted to get out of this place and I can't, I have to wait about one more year, then after that there's at least 2 more years when I transfer. This makes a total of approximately six years to get my degree. Now let's just hope I even get a chance to get a job....that's another story.

My parents are very old and sick, and I'm from a lower poor class. They're very demanding and negative about me, and I admit I have many short comings. I need to step up and I always needed to but I never did and wasn't able to, and I let them down.

I feel trapped in my situation, I'm trapped in school, I'm trapped in my lacking social life, I'm trapped by my lack of money, I'm trapped at home. I want my life to start already, I want the rocket to launch but I feel grounded, stuck in the dull black tar pit of my life. My personality is one that seeks novelty, yet my life is extremely monotonous. After four years and seemingly no feeling of ""moving forward"" anywhere school has become a chore. I have a constant feeling of ""frustration"" like I'm stuck, trapped, at a stand still, like I'm trying to run but I'm bound. The ennui of life is bearing down on me and I feel like there's no novelty or purpose to my life. It feels like I'm in life's stream swimming in a pool of molasses.

I just wish there was a clear list of things to do that I can accomplish to stop fucking up in life.

tl;dr

-I'm 22 now

-only 3 friends, no social life.

-stagnate life that is going no where

-people around me are growing and i'm here wasting my life, no degree yet, still have 2 years of school

-no money, poor, parents sick, very old

-4 years wasted at community college, still not done, feel trapped in my situation

I just want to be successful in life for once.

They originally said the application would be up in October, and when it wasn't I called.  In January I spoke to the lady again, and she said they hoped to have up by the end of the month, when they didn't, I called again.  It didn't get posted until March.  After applying and seeing their interview sessions were in April, I called and asked if they had selected their candidates, and just wanted to know where they were in the process.

I don't have Canadian citizenship, but if I graduate and find a job, I would have no problem settling there--love Toronto. Film and writing are my passions outside of web design, and the ability to pursue courses in those areas is important to me.

Basically: help! No idea which direction to go in. My advisers are comparable for each school. There's also a third option: if these won't help my career, I could continue at my full-time design-oriented job now (which I only kind of enjoy) and hope for a promotion/transfer to a department that aligns more with my interests.

**OCAD U**

 * Tuition: $0
 * Living expenses: $20,000
 * Total debt load after 2 years: $40,000ish
 * Not as academically inclined, so I don't think I'd be challenged on the writing/research front as much
 * Would set me up very well to work in film-related fields after I graduate, as the program is fully affiliated with something called the Canadian Film Center
 * Not so many opportunities to do writing/film-related electives
 * Emphasis on paid work while at school, which is more suited to me; I'd be able to keep my freelance design job and offset some of my costs
 * I'd have the summer free this summer, but would have class all through next summer
 * Site: http://www.ocadu.ca/graduate-studies/programs/digital-futures.htm

**Parsons**

 * Tuition: $20,000
 * Living expenses: $20,000
 * Total debt load after 2 years: $80,000ish
 * More prestigious program?
 * Can take more elective courses across the New School, could build experience in digital publishing/interactive filmmaking more easily
 * Would set me up to work in design in NY, which is probably more competitive than it is in Toronto
 * Emphasis on unpaid internships during the program, which I am DONE with
 * Have boot camp this summer (scramble to find an apartment, as they let me know late), but have the summer free next summer
 * Site: http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/

OCAD let me know way earlier, but Parsons only just let me know at the end of April, and has given me until June 5 to decide."

I have been trying to get an internship for the past two years, but do to a bad semester wrangling with statics, my GPA tanked and I am only now recovering to the point of a near 3.0 GPA.

I will need an extra semester to graduate, so that gives one final year of eligibility for most internships. However, I don't think it is likely with my GPA that I will get one, so I have been looking into graduate school programs. I have recently been getting really into business and have been thinking about getting a MBA (or maybe a ms in Industrial eng since that has certain crossovers with business).

So my question is this: Does anyone have a geological engineering undergrad and went into business for a MBA? And if you did, how well did that work out for you?

It is currently in an account in American Century. I have no experience managing my own accounts outside of rent checks and general purchases, but I have been reading PF for a year or so.

I am midway through college in a STEM field, planning on having around $19k in student loans when I graduate.  

I have the option of staying with American Century, and adjusting my asset mix.  The fund is currently 100% stock funds; I can also add in bonds and money market.  I can also pull it out of AC altogether and put it somewhere else.

Additionally, I will be making money this summer in an internship.  Should I add that money I save to this fund, or put it in savings?  What is optimal for the 2 years until I start paying loans back?  

What would you suggest I do?  I don't currently have a need for an emergency fund.  I'm guessing my best bet is to save it for student loans, but what assets should I invest it in?

TL;DR: $5000 trust matured; it's all in stock funds.  Graduate in 2 years with 19k loans.  What's the best move?"
1dvrq0,369,2013-05-07,How to deal with a douche bag... (slightly-NSFW),chabaz,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1dvrq0/how_to_deal_with_a_douche_bag_slightlynsfw/,"(an old story of mine) I used to go to a public high school where the majority of students were low to middle class Italian origin kids of immigrants (90% +). Tough going to say the least. When I was in high school I used to get bullied by a guy called Renaldo. We had a few scraps, either verbally or fisticuffs over the years. I was always the type of guy who wouldn’t take other people’s shit and while others balked at giving me a hard time particularly when I went through puberty and became one of the tallest, largest guys in school he somehow always managed to give me a hard time. It was a tough time but in a way, I paid my dues early and learnt from a stern father that if people punched you, you punch back and you punch harder and you'll know if they are men or not.

As luck would have me, Renaldo ended up in the same college I went to and he always managed to somehow, someway be a little shit to me. What made things worse is that we fell for the same girl, Andrea who eventually became my girlfriend of over 4 years. Everyone knew he had feelings for her and that it killed him she was with me and not him. He always tried to “seduce” her with random calls and emails, being the son of a wealthy father who owned his own construction company, that he had nice cars, lots of money, a bunch of shit that I didn’t have and over the years worked hard to earn coming from a low income family that was having problems making ends meet.

He was a constant issue the first year of my relationship and we had several conflicts,

Years later, after college and shortly after I broke up with Andrea, I received an e-mail from him out of the blue. I never corresponded with him (Facebook didn’t exist back then) and he went out and told me in an epic letter which went far too long, swore at me in excess and used terrible English (no wonder he never finished college and dropped out to work with daddy). Basically it was a ""No one liked me in college and to F off"".

I haven’t seen him in well over 2 years, nor did we have any real friends in common. As a way of keeping my cool, nor did I want him to have the satisfaction to get me mad, I never responded to his emails (he sent several).

However, I couldn't let his taunting go without consequences.

So I went online and Googled his name. After searching around a bit I easily found a complete profile of him regarding his career, where he worked and what type of work it was. His father passed away recently and he now owned his father's business and had a team of employees working for him. I spied a bit more and hung onto the address of his place of employment for several weeks while I plotted.

One day, I proceeded to go into a local sex shop and I purchased the largest, fattest, floppiest black dildo that I could find along with some KY and I went home, wrote a special note for him and put it along with the big fat black dildo and KY and boxed it in a standard box that couldn’t be traced back to me and sent it priority mail that required for him specifically to sign.

The note read, ""Since you have so much time to search out people that never gave a shit about you to begin with, I figured you'd have enough time to go fuck yourself with this!""

One of our mutual acquaintances dropped me an email a few days later. This acquaintance worked for Renaldo during his ""internship"" and apparently the package arrived while they were preparing to head out for a team lunch on a Friday and he was very excited to get the box opened since Renaldo thought it was something he ordered online that he was expecting and would ""make it a good weekend"" and he opened it in front of a number of co-workers and instead of whatever he ordered he pulls out....a giant black floppy dildo.

1dvnro,46,2013-05-07,Graduated too long ago but not enough experience to find a job. I'm stuck and utterly confused about where to go from here.,stuckengr,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1dvnro/graduated_too_long_ago_but_not_enough_experience/,"**Edit: Wow, thanks for all the feedback and advice everyone! I'll try to respond to people individually later tonight.**

I'm a 24 year old guy that graduated in 2011 from the University of Michigan with a degree in mechanical engineering. I did well in my classes. My GPA was ~3.3 and I always worked hard and had a good grasp of the material and tried to take leadership roles in my projects. I graduated in 4 years, but admittedly didn't put effort into career development while I was a student. I guess I didn't realize how important that was. I guess I always just assumed that I'd apply to jobs and get interviews and everything to fall into place. In hindsight, that was a stupid assumption. In any case, I didn't start going to the career fairs until my junior year, and I wasn't able to secure any internships during the summer (which wasn't entirely uncommon anyway. A very small percentage of my classmates were being accepted to internships). 

I graduated without a job or any real sense of what I wanted to do in general. I'll try to spare you the boring details, but mentally, I was struggling. I was overwhelmed with the idea of graduating and battling with some depression problems, and I decided to take some time off and travel. I had always regretted not doing a semester abroad, and this seemed like a good choice at the time.

That extended into 2012, and then I was back home and ready to resume my job search. But nothing really came out of it. Days turned into weeks. Weeks into months. And before I knew it, 2012 was coming to a close without having made any real progress. In my mind, I had good grades from a good university, and *someone* would want me. I also had lots of people saying things like ""Oh, engineering? You'll find a job easy."" So I guess I convinced myself that something would eventually fall into my lap.

Then this past January, it hit me. I'm fucking up. I've been out of school for over a year and a half, I'm financially dependent on my parents, and my career search was pitiful.

I had a big change in attitude. I started working with a career counselor to revamp my resume and learn how to market myself and network. I had family friends willing to put me in touch with engineers they knew, and I set up and went on networking trips to different cities. I started talking to a couple different recruiters at companies. I phoned in to the Michigan Engineering Career Resource Center for help. I have friends at engineering firms that have passed along my resume. I've reached out to people on LinkedIn to network. I'm going to job fairs. I've even applied blindly to job postings I find online. 

And literally nothing has come out of it. I try to stay positive, knowing that all it takes is *one* person or company to say yes, but I'm getting very discouraged. Half the time, I don't even hear back from companies. And nobody I talk to seems to be in a position to be of any real help. Basically, my job search is falling flat. And I'm starting to panic.

The reality is that I'm 2 years out of school with no applicable experience. (I have some job experience with computer / IT work, which is better than being a camp counselor, I suppose, but it's not directly engineering-related.) And the gaps are starting to grow on my resume. And that seems to be a big hinderance to even getting companies to talk to me. At this point, I'd be willing to settle for *anything*. I'd take an unpaid internship just to gain experience, but I don't even seem to qualify for that. 

So I'm stuck and I have no idea what to do. The path I took post-graduation was unorthodox, and looking back, I know I made some mistakes. If you feel the need to call me an idiot for not realizing the importance of internships or for not taking the job search seriously until recently, go ahead. I've spent many sleepless nights regretting the past 2 years of accomplishing nothing, so it's nothing I don't already know.

But my point in posting here is to try to figure out where to go from here, because what I'm doing isn't working. Maybe I need to consider going back to school in order to start fresh and ""get back in the game""? I don't know. Can anyone give me some guidance?"

From what I've seen, they dress very casually and comfortably at the office - shorts, jeans, t-shirts, etc.

While I typically wore suits for internship interviews at bigger, more corporate companies, I'm planning on dressing down for this. I was thinking dark jeans or olive chinos, a blue ocbd, and walnut strands. My parents think I should also wear a blazer, and while I don't think it's necessary, it's probably not a bad idea.

After looking around a bit, I'm not entirely sure what to get. Material, structured vs. unstructured, color, solid vs. patterned, fit. 

This will be my first real blazer, so I'd like to get something versatile of decent quality. Brooks Brothers has the friends &amp; family sale, so I've been primarily looking there. I've also browsed J.Crew, but they don't seem to have as wide of a selection.

Here's what I've found so far in my size (36S):

* [Fitzgerald fit, Saxxon wool, Grey, Made in US, $360](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/MM00143_GREY?$bbenlarged$)
* [Milano fit, Linen, Navy mini-stripe, $336](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/MM00213_NAVY?$bbenlarged$)
* [Black Fleece, Wool/cashmere, Grey-Navy plaid, Made in US, $375](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/FM00072_GREY-NAVY?$bbenlarged$)
* [Black Fleece, Camel Hair, Grey, Made in US, $435](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/FM00063_GREY?$bbenlarged$)
* [Madison fit, Wool, Tan Plaid, $336](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/MM00224_TAN-BLUE?$bbenlarged$)
* [Fitzgerald fit, Linen, Tan, $336](http://s7d4.scene7.com/is/image/BrooksBrothers/MM00193_TAN?$bbenlarged$)

They're all a little steep price-wise, but I don't mind paying for something in this price range if it's high quality and something I'll use for a while.

Thoughts? Advice? Give me a few options, because some of the items I found are on sale and will probably sell out soon.

1dvhec,17,2013-05-07,I[m19] am experiencing severe burnout and my mother[57] is threatening to stop paying tuition,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dvhec/im19_am_experiencing_severe_burnout_and_my/,"This story is bit complicated, but I'm going to try and reduce it to the bare minimum you need to know. 

This year and semester in particular have been very hard on me. I've experience depression, burnout, and self doubt, without getting into the specifics too much. At this point, I really need the summer to recover. I'm a 19 - almost 20 - year old male from the USA. 

I should preface by saying that in the past, working over the summer has been an issue between my mother (57 - highly conservative and traditional) and me. I attended a rigorous boarding prep school for high school, and was usually so exhausted and emotionally drained by the end of the year, that I needed the summer to relax so that I could function properly during the next school year. I finally did get a job last summer - nothing special, just a cashier position. 

Of course, this is no longer enough for my mother. In her eyes, the fact that I go to a top university means that I need to be getting internships during the summer, because she believes that I am one of the only students who hasn't had internships since they were in high school and because she believes that if I do not have an internship now, I will never secure a job. On top of that, she believes that my desire to rejuvenate over the summer means that I never want to work and will never hold a job. She has in fact told me that she worries about me becoming homeless because of what she has decided is a complete lack of interest in working (not true!). What more, the profession I am trying to enter (classical music) has nothing to do with any of the internships that she wants me to enter. 

Because of the difficulties that I have experienced this semester, I know that I will be on the path to either dropping out of college or perhaps becoming suicidal if I do not stop and take the break I need now. I have told my mother this via email, but she was not responsive, and has said that a break of no more than a week is necessary for any type of exhaustion, and that if the school is as stressful as it is, then I need to switch to a community college near home, because ""if I don't want a big fancy job then I don't deserve a big fancy education."" Switching schools is really not a good idea at this point, because the amount of money saved would be trivial, I have a near perfect GPA, and I've implemented a dozen or more measures to ensure that I will work at a humane pace starting in the next semester. 

It seems as though my mother is completely ignoring the many things I've done right to get where I am and can only focus on the fact that I do not want an internship in the field she wants me to enter. I refuse to talk on the phone with her anymore, because all communication with her becomes emotionally abusive very quickly. I do acknowledge (and have told her) that I see that her intentions are in the right place, but the fact of the matter is that my interactions with her have been a significant contributor to my depression. 

Today, I will be meeting with my adviser to discuss what happens should my parents stop paying my tuition. I will also go to my school's counseling services to see if I can get some sort of official recommendation for an extended break, and maybe that will convince her.

I have shown several of my friends the correspondence, and although they are biased, they do say that they believe my mother is being incredibly unfair. At this point, I am scared to return home for the summer in two weeks, and am desperately trying to arrange alternative housing with friends. 

The arguing reached its climax yesterday (and may continue to get worse), and since I woke up today I have been nauseous to the point of not being able to concentrate from being nervous and anxious. 

At this point, I'd just love it if my mother understood my position better, but I'm not sure how to do this as I sent a very neutral toned email explaining my concerns (and not accusing her of anything!). It seems as though she is disregarding what I believe to be some serious mental health issues that need to be addressed. 

Therefore, the ideal situation would be for my mother to understand and back off such that I feel safe going home and spending the recovery time I need, but I'm not optimistic for that outcome. I feel that if she properly understood, then she would realize that the measures I've taken to ensure that I do not burnout in the future will be effective, and that my self-imposed work pace is the problem and not my university - which would hopefully stop her threats. 

Does Reddit have any advice for me? 

tl;dr - holding an internship this summer will exacerbate mental health issues to the point of dropping out of school and/or suicidal behavior, and mother is dismissive and threatening to stop paying tuition.

A lot of you have pretty good advice, and I'm in need of some concerning an internship I'm applying for. For starters, I need 3 letters of recommendation. This part in itself isn't a problem; the problem is I don't know how to have them sent in to the program. 

It says to send my cover letter, resume, letters and transcript to XYZ address, which I assume means that *I* am responsible for sending in everything in one packet, including the letters of rec. However, one person that I would like a letter from is my adviser, and the semester is about to end. The application isn't due until October 31st (I'm graduating before then), so should I give him an enveloped addressed to my place and just put that in? If so how do I address that envelope? Just to myself? Or should I just try to get another letter from someone closer to home (like my other two will be) and not have to deal with this whole situation. Everything I've looked up says that the writers of the letters should send the letters to the place, but the application specifically says to send all these things. I'm so confused and I just want to give up on this whole process, except this is kind of a dream internship for me.

Sorry everything is so unorganized, I'm completely coming apart from finals stress. "

(x-post),beautifultranslation,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dv2ij/a_family_member_is_in_a_codependent_relationship/,"Background:

My brother (19) is in quite the situation. Several months after beginning college, he began dating a girl. The relationship seemed to get pretty serious fairly quick. To date, they have been dating for about 6 months. The girl has a background of mental instability and sexual trauma that we are aware of. While they have been dating, the girl has attempted suicide, has been 51/50'd, and was reportedly raped *(I say reportedly because she refused to alert authorities and I also fear she may be claiming this to salvage a relationship that seemed to be fizzling. I feel bad for questioning her, or anyone who claims this, but it is what my gut is telling me. I hope this does not minimize sexual assault or lead others to believe that I am quick to dismiss such a serious claim).* All of this occurred within the past 2 months, but is not the first time she has experienced depression, attempted suicide, or been raped.

Soon after the girl was 51/50'd, my brother began having panic attacks and claimed he was dealing with depression. In fact, his girlfriend essentially diagnosed him (since she has the exact same issues) and convinced him he had these illnesses, for lack of a better word. She convinced him to see someone. Over the course of a month, he began seeing a psychiatrist, therapist, professional counselor, and an intern counselor. He was quickly (like in his first visit) prescribed a mood stabilizer, and anti-depressant medication, and klonopin for anxiety.
Over the course of a month, he seemed to deteriorate emotionally. He struggled to maintain his studies, had frequent anxiety attacks, and seemed more depressed than I have ever seen him.
Fast-forward a couple weeks. We find out that he has been abusing prescription drugs, has been struggling with alcohol addiction, has been possibly shop-lifting, constantly lying to friends and family, making awful choices, and has reportedly gotten engaged (though he has not told us this). He has become someone we do not recognize. We feared for his safety.

We pulled him out of school for a few days to work with him and surround him with family. We find out that his problems with addiction were more than we realized. He is unhappy with how things are and begins to see how upset his family has become. In the meantime, he continuously sneaks away to see his girlfriend and gets seriously upset when we try and get him back home. We knew he was in an unsafe place and this girl was not a person he should be around. When he is with family, he becomes more of the person we know him as; however, he seems to become someone else when he talks with or sees her. We believe that he is in an extremely unhealthy, dangerous, and codependent relationship.

After he comes home for a few days, we all come to accept that he needs a rehabilitation program. He wants to go and knows that he needs to get clean and work on himself. He checked himself into a rehab center last week.
He calls when he can. He has, on more than one occasion, requested we send him his girlfriend's phone number. We politely refuse because we are uncomfortable doing so. We want him to focus on himself and just get healthy. He gets upset when we refuse to give him what he wants. Truth is, if he wants to contact her, he will find a way. We know that -- we don't want to enable the relationship or feel pressured into doing something we are uncomfortable with.

We know that the girl is not the source of the problem. He makes his own decisions and is responsible for them. But we do feel that she manipulates him severely. Her (very recent) sexual trauma and past emotional problems lead us to believe that she is in no place ready to develop a healthy relationship. The relationship screams codependency and appears very toxic. Our greatest fear is that he will return from rehab in 3 weeks and jump right back into the relationship without having developed the mental strength and skills necessary to deal with his personal issues and issues within the relationship.

I'm not quite sure what I am looking for, but I feel that I need some outside advice. I would like to hear some opinions from others outside my family. I apologize if I skimmed over anything or did not go into enough detail.

**TL:DR** - Brother in rehab for prescription drug addiction. In a highly toxic and codependent relationship. Fear that he will jump into the relationship immediately after rehab without developing the skills and mental strength necessary to get healthy. Looking for advice."

As I was completing this program, the higher-ups deemed it necessary to slice the program into two different paths.  Oracle Administration and Microsoft SQL Administration.  I chose Oracle, and have been getting my hands dirty with SQLDeveloper among other tools, venturing into PL/SQL most recently.

I have three classes left associated with my program.  This summer I don't have to take any classes, so I was hoping to get lucky and find a place to acquaint myself in the database world.  It's very unlikely, but I will try.  My question is, in the event I can't find any real world practice before I complete my program; what would you suggest I do in order to prepare myself for the field?

I'm almost certain I'll have to attend school for a bachelors program eventually, but I was hoping to have enough skill through my studies to at the very least land an entry-level or internship with a company that has use for me.  In my humble opinion, while databases can be complex, it's something that can be learned on your own; which is why I chose not to enroll and take on huge debt with a university, for something I could learn through a community college and off-school studying.

I want to do my work, it's fun and rewarding, but it's just that I can't seem to get into that 'space'. No matter what I try. The best I've done was 2 hours. More than that and I just lose interest. Which is annoying, since it ís interesting.

Her:  I checked in w ******** and she had noted that she was unclear on which G+ profile you linked to. I have 2 girls who have been completely unresponsive and what I sent was a copy/paste. Now that I have info that you've been trying to work this thru I can work directly with you on it. For folks that are unresponsive I don't have a choice but to roll it up to someone else. Google dings us hard w the authorship jig

Me:  Can you explain to me what exactly rolling it up to someone else means?

Her:  Yes, it would push the posts under someone else's Wordpress profile

Me:  Would it still have my name on it

Her:  Not if we rolled it to someone else. But it's a non-issue if you've been working on it. My intern was unclear on what was going on w your account

Me:  I have to be honest ********** I don't really appreciate the tone you came at me with regarding this. I would have been happy to help if you would have approached me nicely but instead you said you were going to just give my content to another writer if I didnt cooperate. As someone who considers you a friend I'm not sure why you felt it was necessary to try and strong arm me. Please just remove all of my writing from the website

Her:  I think you're reading a little too deeply into it. I voiced over and over that my goal was to give each writer cred. I stated 3 times that I wanted you to keep the credit - could you point to the language I used that made it seem like my intent was anything else?  I'm really confused

Me:  The intent wasn't the issue it was the tone and the fact that you would think it was acceptable to give my writing or anyones writing to someone else for any reason. I'm sorry this isn't working out how you would like but I'm not going to make an account at this point and I'm not giving my consent to you using my content so the only option now is to just take it down.

Her:  ******, I'm not sure where this is coming from but as a friend I'm going to honor your request

Me:  I appreciate it thank you

Her:  Could you please let me know how you read into tone via text?  Again, I'm still confused. I've tried to be ultra supportive, I feel like this is really out of left field and my communication was not a strong arm. If it was, I would have used very different language. But now, here we are. Your friendship obviously means more to me, but I need to learn ur communication style. And I hope you can see what a precarious situation this puts me. I hope we can talk this through

Me:  I'm not going to argue semantics. You didnt approached this as someone who is a friend so I didn't feel the need to respond like a friend. You set the tone and if you can't see that I would suggest showing this to someone you trust will give you an honest opinion of how you sound. Nothing more to talk through just please take everything down.

Her:  How about taking a walk to talk it thru in person. Actually I sent this to 3 other people and got a completely congenial response so honestly I'm really unclear on what brought you to this conclusion. I really wish you could at least point out how you got here so I can see how we can remedy this.

Me:  I would be happy to walk with you or talk with you at some point because I believe this can be separated from our friendship if we want it to be, but just so you understand the situation well I'm not going to change my mind regarding removing the content.

Her:  Available tomorrow? And I hope you understand that each piece of content is an investment for ******, so I'm will try to push it but I'm not sure how the company will need to handle it. I'm more interested in ensuring that you and I can come to terms w this so I can understand why this upset you so badly

Me:  No I am helping my sister this week because she is about to have her baby but I am available next week. And the company has no option but to take it down. They can't falsely use my content under someone else's name so please have it taken down by Friday.

Her: Like I said, I'll do what I can."

I've had depression since I was about seven, attributed to chemical imbalance mostly and yet real life still seems to kick me in the ass sometimes. I finally got on medication when I was 15, and have been doing on-and-off well. But lately it's been the worse than it has ever been. I'm 22 and I have achieved nothing. All my life it has been drilled into me that by now I should have gone through college, graduated, and gotten a job or internship that relates to what I want to do with the rest of my life. I've failed at trying this multiple times, I haven't even fully completed my freshman year. My parents tell me they'll support me with whatever I choose to do ... but years of money spent on failed classes because I haven't been able to focus or I have been to anxious to go has strained them. I can see it. I've been on cymbalta for a couple years now and it seemed to do the trick, but I'm still tired all of the time and have severe anxiety attacks and days where I can't bring myself to do anything. In the end I fail. I always fail.

I feel lazy, I feel worthless, and while my loved ones keep telling me, like any other disease, depression is something that can't be healed overnight, years of its ups and downs have finally hit me the hardest now. I'm going to my new doctor to discuss it tomorrow, but what if she tells me all this time I've been wrong? I've convinced myself that maybe I need new medication, or maybe I have some hormonal imbalances. But what if I really am just using this as an excuse? What do I do then?"

First off, I'm graduating in about six months with a computer science undergrad degree at the University of Oregon. I have my Network+, and Security+ certificates and I'm working on getting the CCNA and CCNP certifications. Sadly I have no professional work experience or internships, all I have is unrelated work doing groundskeeping for my university and unfortunately it looks like I'm going to be stuck with this. Additionally though, I do have an uncertified B2 level understanding of German from classes and work outside the classroom.

With my certifications, degree, and some hobby work (I run a private video/music server and a public web/email server) would it be realistic that I could find a job as a jr. systems administrator or similar after graduation? Where would be the best place to look? If it's unrealistic, what should I work on to improve my CV?

Background is as follows:

* Current GPA is a 3.377 with a 3.625 for last Spring.  My Statistics GPA is a 3.52, and a 3.59 when a class taken outside my university is included (I received an A, but it appears as transfer credit on my transcript).

* Two Calculus-based mathematical statistics courses, along with two linear algebra courses: one applied/theoretical, and one scientific computing-oriented.

* Regression, including work on an independent project

* [A week-long statistical modeling workshop](http://www.samsi.info/workshop/undergraduate-modeling-workshop-may-13-17-2013) with SAMSI in North Carolina, where I modeled climate data in R.

* General experience with Python.  I've done some small mining of Twitter with it.

* Some experience with Java, but I will be taking an introductory course on it this summer.

* Basic understanding of MATLAB that will improve this summer with a numerical linear algebra course

* R

* Excel

* LaTeX

I do not have any SQL experience but am looking to gain some, if possible.  I am a fast learner and can pick it up if need be.  The same applies for any other database management system, including (and especially) SAS.

I will be in Pittsburgh starting on May 20.  Please message if you are interested in hiring me."

1dukv5,1,2013-05-07,Question About Myself,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1dukv5/question_about_myself/,"So I guess this is going to be a pretty long post. 

I've just finished my first year of college at a very prestigious university. Its the place that I have always wanted to be, and I always thought about going here before I actually got in. I did fine, and I am basically satisfied with my grades, social life and related things. However, college was really, really stressful for me, much more than I expected it to be. My job is really time consuming and my schoolwork was also tough (gotta beat the standard deviation scores!). I felt like I never had any time to stop, or slow down or relax. 

Over the past year, starting in the late spring of 2012, I have had several short intervals of depression-like feeling which lasted anywhere from 1-3 days, only to go away for like a week. I would often think about how what I was doing in life was very pointless and there would be no worth in it after I died. I had ideas about suicide, but they are really only thoughts, and not real intentions. They were more like ""what if"" questions that I thought about in my mind. Sometimes I would cry at night too. I would also often think about negative things about myself.

Also, even though I have only smoked pot a few times (I tried it for the first time last fall), I often found myself wanting more of it during these phases. I like the way it makes everything feel different, and how it makes me think in radically different ways. I guess its just an easy way of escapism for me. I worry about what will happen when I have as much access as I can to it, which is probably going to happen this summer and next semester in school.

So now its the end of the year, but I don't feel accomplished at all, despite all that I have done (pretty much straight A's and a good position in a school organization). I should be happy about finishing, but I see all my peers lined up with these summer jobs and whatever, and I have nothing and no internship despite applying to some.  

I feel like my mental health isn't normal, but I also I feel like its not enough for me to go see a doctor, because usually I AM fine. I know this might scream BIPOLAR but I still don't know if its really that severe. I haven't told anyone about these feelings either. I doubt anyone knows about it because whenever I am with people I am usually ok, and I smile a lot with them. What are your thoughts?"

Edit2: for those interested in my routine/diet (copied from a comment of mine)

I follow the flexible dieting protocol, where I have a set # of macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbs) that I try to hit for each day. In addition to this, I make sure I get 2 servings vegetables, and at least 1 serving fruit just for overal health/wellness. Throughout my weight gain, both my calories and macronutrients have consistently increased. I partition them at ~35-40% protein, 20-25% fat, and 40% carb.
For my routine I follow a push/pull/legs/off split. Where push= chest/shoulders/triceps legs= self explanatory lol pull= back/biceps
In terms of compound lifts, I actually only recently started squatting, before that I was just using the leg press. I've put a primary focus on incline dumbell bench as opposed to flat bench, and I'm going to learn to deadlift this summer when I move to my new gym."

But she doesn't want to leave the field, so she thinks she may want to work in another capacity for a biotech or pharmaceutical company. She isn't entirely sure what her options could be or what education is needed. 

Part of the problem is that she's moving up to Westchester, NY to live with me in the end of June and hopefully we can relocate to a warmer/cheaper region of the country by September. Being that she'll be a year removed from college, she's unsure of her qualifications for internships.

1ducdc,1,2013-05-07,"[23/M] here, dating a [20/F]. My depression, gf being hesitant to open up, this stupid routine, and on top of it all, it's a fairly new relationship. Advice needed.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ducdc/23m_here_dating_a_20f_my_depression_gf_being/,"Wall of text:

1. My grandmother passed away in January and I didn't really get a chance to cope until very recently. The week prior to her death, I managed to acquire two jobs (an internship at my university and a tutoring job) so I kinda just stayed busy and kept my grieving to a minimum. This worked for me for awhile, but it came raging to the forefront a few weeks ago.

2. Met the gf in February. Things were fucking awesome. Lots of fun and general excitement. I worked very hard to get her to be with me, so of course I was pretty elated when it panned out. We are very different in personality, though. For an idea, I'm an ESFJ and she's an INFP.

3. I'm very much extroverted and social. She's definitely social as well, but not even close to the extent I am. I'm fine with that, though. We acknowledged our differences very early on, but as you'll see soon there needs to be some changes. 

4. Fell into a terrible routine. In our defense, we were both horribly busy with school (plus I had my jobs still). We made time for one another at the expense of our social lives. In hindsight, this was a horrible idea; but if we hadn't done so we would've only been seeing each other once a week so...maybe it wasn't?

5. Work and school really, really wore me down (or at least that's what I think happened). Normally I'm a outspoken and cheery dude, but I noticed some drastic changes in my behavior. I became disinterested in hanging out with people, my grades, going to class, etc. I became quiet and mopey. I slept WAY more than usual. I don't know if I was just burnt out or if I was just depressed, but it was bad. But anyway, this funk lasted for a month but finally subsided around finals week (last week).

6. During this funk, I became pretty fucking boring. I know I did. And it drove me crazy. Along with it, I'd question her on stupid things. Like, if she was snappy or being distant I'd ask her what's up whenever she was probably just tired and grumpy. I'd worry about our relationship; I'd read into what she said too much... Fuck man, I was paranoid. It's amazing she didn't ditch.

7. To add to this nonsense, I really didn't realize what was going on with me at the time. It took a friend pointing out to me that I was being shitty (mopey, sad, quiet, etc). But once I did acknowledge what was wrong with me, I made a conscious decision to fix it. It's been a little over a week into working on it, and I do feel loads better (school's over so that was a big weight lifted as well). Went and visited my family, grandma's gravesite (I actually felt closure. The day of the funeral I had to leave home to go back to my school/work combo, so I didn't get a chance to deal with it).

8. I told her about all this around a week ago. She asked if I wanted a break and I told her no, that I wanted to work through this and be with her at the same time. I told her I was sorry for letting my issues creep into our relationship, and that next time I would come to her with it. She says she understands, but is just really concerned (for reasons I totally understand).

9. My issues with her: she's been hesitant to open up with me since the beginning, yet she told me last night she wants more of a relationship. I told her the two don't exactly go hand-in-hand, that I really wanted her to come to me with concerns and really anything. Now I understand that I wasn't exactly up front with my situation, but I genuinely didn't realize it was happening other than me being a bit testy at times (rarely around her). I'm willing to be vulnerable with her and always have been, but she has really taken her time doing this. I acknowledge that everyone is different when it comes to this, but my god, it's frustrating. To boot, it seems like everything I ask is too personal for her to talk about. This makes it nearly impossible to get to know her, so of course I'm feeling a bit distant myself.

TL;DR: Fell into a funk with everything; dealt with it pretty well on a personal level; however, this funk crept into my relationship, and I feel terrible for it; girlfriend won't open up because of who-knows-what, and it's testing my patience  (we have plans to talk about this communication business next week when she visits, but we're still talking via phone); I want more communication and comfort (as does she), but I'm scared to death that I may have ruined everything. 


I just want an objective opinion and some advice. Give it to me straight, please. 

And I'm so sorry if this is a jumbled mess of a post. As you can probably tell, I'm pretty scatterbrained at the moment."

Now, I just wanted to know how many other gatech redditors besides myself who are still unemployed in their respective major field after 1 or more years post tech. Have you given up and decided to pursue other career fields or are you still determined to continue and muscle through?

A bit of my background:
I graduated in Spring 2012 (BSAE) with a 2.6+ GPA, no internships or coops (as no company would give me a chance during my 5 years), with 1 year of part time work in our design lab. I knew full well the day I graduated that I was at a severe disadvantage despite the Gatech name on my degree, yet I still wanted to find work in the AE industry. I took the FE exam the following OCT, passed and received EIT status by JAN2013, and yet as of now, I have only landed 2 in-person interviews (ME-industry related) and 2 phone interviews (AE related), both of which fell through due to my lack of experience and low GPA. I've only listed my GPA a handful of times in over 300+ applications. I haven't received a call back from anyone since February, and I've just given up and relegated myself back to taking classes as a post-bacc student here in my local Uni, hopefully starting this summer, with the intention of raising my GPA and gaining acceptance into a M.Engr. program down the road. 

Idk, but I hoped that having an AE degree from Gatech would at least give me a few more opportunities at interviews, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Honestly, had I known that along with a multitude of other things, I would have stayed home and attended a local uni for much cheaper than paying out-of-state tuition for 5 years at Gatech when I have nothing to show for it. Needless to say, I'm pretty bummed.

Anyone here can relate? Or is my luck just that shitty lol.

1dua0w,2,2013-05-06,How should I finish up?,throwingitaway1991,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1dua0w/how_should_i_finish_up/,"I spent 2 years a top 50 school leaving with a mediocre at best GPA and less than 40 credits.  I was lucky enough to be offered an internship the summer after my sophomore year which due to changes in the company stretched out for another two years.  Last January I enrolled at a local state university where I have a 3.8+ GPA.  I have 14 credits left to finish out my BS in Economics and had a question regarding how I should finish it up.  In order to get the BS I need to complete Calculus II (I know, should have done that way back).  I also have to take 7 credits at my present school which will be done online.  These are the options I presently have:

1.  Complete 10 credits online at present school and take Calculus II at another school in my hometown, allowing me to finish up by the end of June.

2. Complete 7 credits online at present school, take Calculus II and an Economics course at Harvard (which has open enrollment for the summer, but at significant cost,)  this would result in me finishing up by the middle of August.

3.  Complete 7 credits online at present school, take an Economics course at Harvard, and take Calc II at a local community college online.  This would also result in me finishing up by the middle of August.

4.  Complete 10 credits online at present school, take Calc II at Harvard, finish in mid august.

5. And finally, the all online option - 10 at present school and Calc II at community college, finish the 10 by end of June and calc ends beginning of August.

Sorry for the rant-length post, but I was hoping I could get some advice from y'all.  I'm thinking that at least having Harvard somewhere on my Resume could be helpful, particularly with the way they are automatically screened today.  On the other hand it is at significant cost and could have a negative impact on my GPA.  Thanks for your time!"

1du3pz,22,2013-05-06,Some thing I'm hoping for in WoD Online,regere,WorldOfDarkness,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldOfDarkness/comments/1du3pz/some_thing_im_hoping_for_in_wod_online/,"**Retainers and ghouls**: Companions to perform tasks for the character, or NPCs that provide support and special abilities in missions. Or maybe those bartenders at the elysium are combat ghoul npcs under control of the current prince?

**Storydriven, user-submitted character building**: Train Stealth 4 (Specialty: Crowd blending) and the player is prompted for details on when and where the character picked up its skills. Character progression could be placing your various learned skills in something of a gant chart, providing a chronological overview of the character's stats.

**User-validated character names**: One way of dealing with trolling character names is a user-controller validation. A character starts out as an unrecognized fledgeling and later (when maybe 10/0 approvals/denials have gone through) his name's displayed. Or even better, the name is never displayed. Characters are known to each other systematically by hidden IDs, whereas the names of the characters are whatever the player types in when a contact is made, either with NPCs or other players.

**Age and character progression**: Kind of tricky since new characters preferably can't start out as elders. By adding more stats in the above mentioned gant-ish chart you add experience to your character. The sum of all that experience levels out to a character's age progression from fledgeling up to elder. Age is not seen by other players but only perceived via paleness (if opted / not spent blood) and any official recognition the character has. Any tremere tasting blood or medical analysis of blood may just have old data (loss of memory?) on the approximate age or density of the blood and need to re-check the samples.

**Status**: Gain recognition from NPCs, clans, harpies and so on. Depending on faction it might give you free blood at the nearest elysium, access to parts of of Nosferatu sewers in city, +2 for occult research if friends with the Tremere in that city and so on.

**Non-democratically chosen princes**: The pen is mightier than the sword, but not always.

**Lore**: A lore-system that unlocks conversation options, special abilities and contact with various entities would be cool, but a kind of achievement-hunting list of lores that describe the world would be an alternate approach. Either way, WoD is filled with lore and there's gonna be crawling with players knowing alot of stuff about it. Some kind of lore system is gonna be needed for new players to pick up on the backstory and terms, and veterans of WoD will need to know what differs WoD online from the old WoD.

**Make coteries, not guilds**: I really can't see a guild of 200 vamps marching towards a city, nor any prince that could stand against them. Grouping should be small and decentralized, allowing players to found coteries (or packs) that have a maximum number of members. Members of the coterie share benefits from working together (easier feeding, local recognition, shared alliances, ability to take on group tasks) but also disadvantages such as enemies of a specific member or disdain from a rivalling coterie. Players should be able to join several coteries, hidden as well as official, while also being able to have some kind of group membership / status as a clan mate, a recognized vamp of the camarilla and so on.

**Some letting loose, some hard grips**: What have we learned so far? There's always gonna be some guy who wants to play a flying warlock, and there's always gonna be someone who wants to play a Camarilla-infiltrating black hand tzimisce infernalist inquisitor. I'm cool with the latter if it's tied to gether with some kind of reputation / title / quest, players should have the possibility to play their strange bloodline or choose their disciplines as a caitiff only to later realize where they're really coming from. Being able to create a unique characters is very important, but we don't want an elysium full of flying warlocks and gargoyles.

**User-submitted content**: Here's an MMORPG that actually stems from a real RPG. Tons of players are gonna be old tabletop gamers and LARPers with lots of experience in creating setting. Let the collective citizens of each city help to build it in terms of places, backgrounds, layouts, both information wise and design/layout wise. A character's haven should feel personal. A kindredified version of the Sims where I can plan my mansion or make room for my coffin in my 1 room apartment but add extra security layers and sprinklers would be cool. At least there has to be some way to show off Resources or my Ventrue family's heir, vanity rocks.

**Legacy**: Players should be able to build their family trees of biological relatives, embraced people, ghouls, allies and enemies and players should be able to play each others respective. This way my character's personal standing with the Toreador in city X might be ruined by a botched conversation my friend's character had with them.

**Events**: World and local events. Everything from a bloodhunt or domain vaulderie to a world-wide anathema hunt or conclave. Put a CCP intern on roleplaying an archon rallying the nearby camarilla cities for a siege against a newly-turned anarch state. Let a developer join the world as a justicar to publically execute exploiters.

**A very early public alpha/beta**: By introducing players early, the feedback from roleplayers can be introduced at an early stage and help shape a very mature product, both technically and in terms of a new gameplay experience.

Can users share their year or time after graduation?",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1du3ii/about_to_graduate_really_really_scared_any_advice/,"I'm going to try to make this as concise as possible, because I, myself, hate long winded posts. 

I'm about to graduate. Stats here so it's easier to grasp my background:

* Big Ten school (prolly doesn't matter)
* Double Major in Political Science, Global Studies, minor in Asian American Studies. My minor actually gave me more opportunities (internships, scholarships, etc.) than my majors.
* Super seniors due to double major, but I don't mind.
* $45k in school debt, or a bit under. I went to CC too, just went loan crazy after I transferred. Biggest mistake ever.
* Graduating with a 2.8-2.9 GPA.
* Had a great summer internship at a very large and prominent Asian American non profit in DC (think NCAACP but not as vocal).
* Student group President, multiple working experiences on campus, decent professional network
* My personal trait is that I can be highly incompetent and lazy. I have no clue how to fix this.

I guess my concern is... school was a safe grounds. I enjoyed it. I had bills but I scraped by. But now the loans will catch up to me. I will have to find a REAL job. I'm pushing to finish my degree but come May 19th, it's all over and I will be sitting at home doing who knows what until I find something. That scares me. Going from ""doing this and this"" to ""I have nothing, atm"".

Problem is, I have no clue what to find. I have been talking to a Navy Officer recruiter for a few weeks but he sort of lost interest in me because my application has a hang up (I suppose once that hang up is clear, he will contact me again).

I also applied to graduate school. I met the director of the program and, well, basically she's a huge bitch. She may or may not be reflective of the program and staff but I can't afford graduate school, so I am throwing that out of the window now. So I'm sort of in a pickle, just waiting to graduate, waiting for my Navy OCS application to be OK'd.

**TL;DR: I guess I'm just anxious about graduating college, about life after. Redditors, you please share your life after graduation? Your feelings? Specifically of the first few months or first year or until you found your comfortable spot in life?**"

I am a freshman at a state university with no security courses taught here nor any active security groups. I am trying to get a couple of students together to start a CTF team, but I really don't know what I am doing in that regard. We do have a decently ranked CS program in light of not having any security specific classes.

* I am a good CS student; to the point where I have tested out of classes and have been approved for taking grad courses next year
* I would like to either be a software engineer or a pen tester after I graduate, and would like to know how to best prepare for pen testing since I have the SE part covered with past experience.
* I have a SE internship at a fortune 100 tech company in a hardware group (nothing to do with security) and I'm wondering how I should approach the security departments (or if I should at all) at said company to express my interest
* As far as I know, there are only two pen testing orgs that operate in my state
* I have WAHH 2, CEH study guide (v7 I believe), quite a few Cisco books for CCNP and CCNA which I will probably study for, but not take the exams. I like having knowledge even if I don't have the certs. Quite a few other books in security from lock picking to SQL injection (more advanced topics of SQL injection, not really beginner topics except the first couple of chapters).
* I have recently gotten into a lot of trouble at my university for ""hacking"" their registration system (I basically just bypassed part of the system to register for classes early) so they will probably not be too happy if I try to organize a CTF team or an infosec club on campus because I received a total of 68 months of probation from various departments on campus.
* I am also interested in malware analysis and have done a lot of this on .NET and Java malware in years past. I am very proficient in Java bytecode. This could be another avenue of work I may pursue, but I am at a loss for what goes into getting into this field.

Thanks!"

I don't like grocery shopping.

WELL WE CAN TAKE WALKS AND TALK ABOUT THINGS ||NOT|| the past. You dwell in the past like a fucking Smeagol. 

You hate on my boyfriend, who cares for me and goes out of his way to see if he can cheer me up, when all you do is put me down: you don't try hard enough (no, I shit out equations day and night), you don't try and find jobs (well it's not my fault they all happened to be unpaid internships BUT THEY'RE JOBS AND MY ENTRY LEVEL SALARY IS MORE THAN YOU AND DAD'S COMBINED). You hate on him even though dad gambled away all the money and perpetually annoys you and you don't even bash on that, but you hate on the one person who I genuinely enjoy being around?

I'm an adult now. I have to leave the nest sometime and you have to suck that up. I'll fly fucking back because I have these fancy metaphorical wings people like to talk about; I'm not a heartless fuck who'll sayonara-the-fuck-outta-here just  because she has a man. I just want to move on with my life and grow a little. Experience more than melons and the latest Chinese celebrity gossip and you hatred of every human being around you except yourself.

You can't drive an argument by talking over me. You can't assume you're right and just shoot for sarcasm right after I throw the harsh truth out. You're not bettering your points; you're making them immature.

Letters often take several weeks to reach our offices, as they have to be processed offsite due to security concerns. If time is of the issue, and it usually is, you are MUCH better off calling in. 

Simply ask the staffer (most likely an intern) to log your concern in their system. Make sure to provide your name/phone number/home address so that we can log you in our system and ensure you a response from the Member of Congress.

1dtwba,1,2013-05-06,A family member is in a codependent relationship and is currently seeking help for drug abuse. I fear his relationship may prevent him from getting healthy. Need advice (x-post),beautifultranslation,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dtwba/a_family_member_is_in_a_codependent_relationship/,"Background:

My brother (19) is in quite the situation.  Several months after beginning college, he began dating a girl.  The relationship seemed to get pretty serious fairly quick.  To date, they have been dating for about 6 months.  The girl has a background of mental instability and sexual trauma that we are aware of.  While they have been dating, the girl has attempted suicide, has been 51/50'd, and was reportedly raped *(I say reportedly because she refused to alert authorities and I also fear she may be claiming this to salvage a relationship that seemed to be fizzling.  I feel bad for questioning her, or anyone who claims this, but it is what my gut is telling me.  I hope this does not minimize sexual assault or lead others to believe that I am quick to dismiss such a serious claim). * All of this occurred within the past 2 months, but is not the first time she has experienced depression, attempted suicide, or been raped.

Soon after the girl was 51/50'd, my brother began having panic attacks and claimed he was dealing with depression.  In fact, his girlfriend essentially diagnosed him (since she has the exact same issues) and convinced him he had these illnesses, for lack of a better word.  She convinced him to see someone.  Over the course of a month, he began seeing a psychiatrist, therapist, professional counselor, and an intern counselor.  He was quickly (like in his first visit) prescribed a mood stabilizer, and anti-depressant medication, and klonopin for anxiety.  

Over the course of a month, he seemed to deteriorate emotionally.  He struggled to maintain his studies, had frequent anxiety attacks, and seemed more depressed than I have ever seen him.  

Fast-forward a couple weeks.  We find out that he has been abusing prescription drugs, has been struggling with alcohol addiction, has been possibly shop-lifting, constantly lying to friends and family, making awful choices, and has reportedly gotten engaged (though he has not told us this).  He has become someone we do not recognize.  We feared for his safety.

We pulled him out of school for a few days to work with him and surround him with family.  We find out that his problems with addiction were more than we realized.  He is unhappy with how things are and begins to see how upset his family has become.  In the meantime, he continuously sneaks away to see his girlfriend and gets seriously upset when we try and get him back home.  We knew he was in an unsafe place and this girl was not a person he should be around.  When he is with family, he becomes more of the person we know him as; however, he seems to become someone else when he talks with or sees her.  We believe that he is in an extremely unhealthy, dangerous, and codependent relationship.

After he comes home for a few days, we all come to accept that he needs a rehabilitation program.  He wants to go and knows that he needs to get clean and work on himself.  He checked himself into a rehab center last week.

He calls when he can.  He has, on more than one occasion, requested we send him his girlfriend's phone number.  We politely refuse because we are uncomfortable doing so.  We want him to focus on himself and just get healthy.  He gets upset when we refuse to give him what he wants.  Truth is, if he wants to contact her, he will find a way.  We know that -- we don't want to enable the relationship or feel pressured into doing something we are uncomfortable with.


We know that the girl is not the source of the problem.  He makes his own decisions and is responsible for them.  But we do feel that she manipulates him severely.  Her (very recent) sexual trauma and past emotional problems lead us to believe that she is in no place ready to develop a healthy relationship.  The relationship screams codependency and appears very toxic.  Our greatest fear is that he will return from rehab in 3 weeks and jump right back into the relationship without having developed the mental strength and skills necessary to deal with his personal issues and issues within the relationship.

I'm not quite sure what I am looking for, but I feel that I need some outside advice.  I would like to hear some opinions from others outside my family.  I apologize if I skimmed over anything or did not go into enough detail.


**TL:DR** - Brother in rehab for prescription drug addiction.  In a highly toxic and codependent relationship.  Fear that he will jump into the relationship immediately after rehab without developing the skills and mental strength necessary to get healthy.  Looking for advice."

I want to help the medical field, but medical school is neither possible at this point nor desirable. I have always been good at math, scoring an 800 on the SAT, but I havent taken any foundational courses in the hard sciences yet (as in chemistry, physics, and higher level biology)
I've read that it may be more beneficial to major in ME or ECE that BME for undergrad, as more options are available, and then moving on to graduate school in BME. Of course, I want to finish my degree as efficiently as possible (I turn 22 this year), so I want to go to a school that would allow me to graduate with a masters in biomedical engineering through a combined 5 year BS/MS program.

Alternatively, I've considered staying with biology and graduating in two years while volunteering at local hospitals, then applying for Boston University's LEAP program, which features a masters degree in Biomedical engineering for those with undergrad degrees in non-engineering fields. I am somewhat suspicious of whether this degree would allow me to break into the industry, as I'd imagine internship and research opportunities would be next to none as a non-engineering undergrad, but this option would seemingly save me a lot of time and money. I am also very hesitant because this would limit my ultimate goal of a biomedical masters to a single school. 

Should I make the jump now to engineering and get that degree in 3 and a half years?

Grew up with a surely no confidence throughout high school. Developed eating disorder 1st yr of college. Sacked up, started eating and lifting religiously. Now have an awesome internship, gf, close circle or friends, and am happier than I've ever been.
The last 2.5 years have been the best years of my life, and I attribute a lot of that to BB. 

I know I have a long way to go, but I'm pretty damn happy with my progress so far...bodybuilding has enhanced my life so much, and I plan on sticking with it for the long haul.

1dtu9r,2,2013-05-06,A family member is in a codependent relationship and is currently seeking help for drug abuse. I fear his relationship may prevent him from getting healthy. Need advice,beautifultranslation,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dtu9r/a_family_member_is_in_a_codependent_relationship/,"Background:

My brother (19) is in quite the situation.  Several months after beginning college, he began dating a girl.  The relationship seemed to get pretty serious fairly quick.  To date, they have been dating for about 6 months.  The girl has a background of mental instability and sexual trauma that we are aware of.  While they have been dating, the girl has attempted suicide, has been 51/50'd, and was reportedly raped *(I say reportedly because she refused to alert authorities and I also fear she may be claiming this to salvage a relationship that seemed to be fizzling.  I feel bad for questioning her, or anyone who claims this, but it is what my gut is telling me.  I hope this does not minimize sexual assault or lead others to believe that I am quick to dismiss such a serious claim). * All of this occurred within the past 2 months, but is not the first time she has experienced depression, attempted suicide, or been raped.

Soon after the girl was 51/50'd, my brother began having panic attacks and claimed he was dealing with depression.  In fact, his girlfriend essentially diagnosed him (since she has the exact same issues) and convinced him he had these illnesses, for lack of a better word.  She convinced him to see someone.  Over the course of a month, he began seeing a psychiatrist, therapist, professional counselor, and an intern counselor.  He was quickly (like in his first visit) prescribed a mood stabilizer, and anti-depressant medication, and klonopin for anxiety.  

Over the course of a month, he seemed to deteriorate emotionally.  He struggled to maintain his studies, had frequent anxiety attacks, and seemed more depressed than I have ever seen him.  

Fast-forward a couple weeks.  We find out that he has been abusing prescription drugs, has been struggling with alcohol addiction, has been possibly shop-lifting, constantly lying to friends and family, making awful choices, and has reportedly gotten engaged (though he has not told us this).  He has become someone we do not recognize.  We feared for his safety.

We pulled him out of school for a few days to work with him and surround him with family.  We find out that his problems with addiction were more than we realized.  He is unhappy with how things are and begins to see how upset his family has become.  In the meantime, he continuously sneaks away to see his girlfriend and gets seriously upset when we try and get him back home.  We knew he was in an unsafe place and this girl was not a person he should be around.  When he is with family, he becomes more of the person we know him as; however, he seems to become someone else when he talks with or sees her.  We believe that he is in an extremely unhealthy, dangerous, and codependent relationship.

After he comes home for a few days, we all come to accept that he needs a rehabilitation program.  He wants to go and knows that he needs to get clean and work on himself.  He checked himself into a rehab center last week.

He calls when he can.  He has, on more than one occasion, requested we send him his girlfriend's phone number.  We politely refuse because we are uncomfortable doing so.  We want him to focus on himself and just get healthy.  He gets upset when we refuse to give him what he wants.  Truth is, if he wants to contact her, he will find a way.  We know that -- we don't want to enable the relationship or feel pressured into doing something we are uncomfortable with.


We know that the girl is not the source of the problem.  He makes his own decisions and is responsible for them.  But we do feel that she manipulates him severely.  Her (very recent) sexual trauma and past emotional problems lead us to believe that she is in no place ready to develop a healthy relationship.  The relationship screams codependency and appears very toxic.  Our greatest fear is that he will return from rehab in 3 weeks and jump right back into the relationship without having developed the mental strength and skills necessary to deal with his personal issues and issues within the relationship.

I'm not quite sure what I am looking for, but I feel that I need some outside advice.  I would like to hear some opinions from others outside my family.  I apologize if I skimmed over anything or did not go into enough detail.


**TL:DR** - Brother in rehab for prescription drug addiction.  In a highly toxic and codependent relationship.  Fear that he will jump into the relationship immediately after rehab without developing the skills and mental strength necessary to get healthy.  Looking for advice."

Anyway, to get right into it. I've just been informed that I will have an intern position at EA Sports Tiburon this summer here in Maitland, FL and will be working directly with the Madden team. They've asked me to compile a list of things before I go in as they make the final changes to Madden 25 this summer and I thought it would be great if I gave this community a chance to voice their opinions. So, if you would kindly list some of these things for me so that I can add it to my recommendations, that would be great.


* If you could add 5 new things to Madden, what would they be?

* If you could take away 5 things from Madden, what would they be?

* What game mechanics do you like, and which ones do you dislike? 

* How important is presentation to you? (Pre-Game, Halftime, Stat updates, etc.)

* List 5 tweaks you would make to this next years Madden

* What would you change about Connected Careers to make it better for you? (Will be called Connected Franchise in Madden 25)

* What would you like to see the next-gen implement with the new Maddens? (Live stream, touch pads, social networking, etc.)

* Do any of you use the Kinect with Madden?

* Do you feel the ratings are accurate? 

* If you were to list 5 over powered things in Madden, what would they be?

* If you were to list 5 under powered things in Madden, what would they be?

I really appreciate the feedback, and hopefully a lot of this information takes some serious consideration from the upper guys at EA Sports. I'll do my best to work some influence at the position I am in. "

Normally, I don't have a fear of rejection. I've been able to deal with girls saying no when asking them to go out with me. ""Meh, there's always someone else."". In this case, I am fucking terrified.

My ex and I broke up during my senior, her junior year of high school. It wasn't on the best of terms, but it wasn't malicious. We had been together for the better part of the best two years of my young life.

She's easily the most beautiful, brilliant, well rounded, *amazing* woman that I've ever met, and is still the best thing that has ever happened to me. She was valedictorian, I had great test scores on my ACT / SAT, but was also a stoner with no motivation. She tried her hardest to motivate me, to get me ready for college, to get me off my ass. She really cared. We loved each other.

We decided it'd be best to take a break since she was studying a lot and I was, well, smoking a ton of pot and partying my senior year into the ground. We still kept in contact, and even had community college courses together. To be honest, we still had a bit of a relationship, but we had to strain ourselves to keep it as casual as we could. She came to a birthday dinner of mine with my parents, and we were on the track to getting back together, against our ""better"" judgement. We both knew I wasn't going to get into the university she was accepted to for at least a year while I finished my courses at CC. Stupidly (at least now I think it stupid), I took my former best friend's advice and cut all ties to her. I was obviously still in love with her, and her with I, but I couldn't take it knowing that we wouldn't be together for at least a year (turned out to be longer). I was immature and selfish. I felt, and still feel, like such a prick. She was trying to reconnect with me and I just blew her off so we wouldn't each be hurt.

I didn't talk to her for almost a year after that. My life fell apart. I moved out of my parents' house at 18 because my adolescent hubris wouldn't allow me to stay with them. How dare they ask me to take out the trash and be home by midnight?! I'm an adult!

I wish I could jump back in time and break my own jaw. It'd be worth the scarring.

Moved out of their house, lost my car (a brand new car they had bought for me), got a shit box of a Kia and moved in with some friends. Stopped going to college. Spent all of my money on pot and alcohol. I can't lie, it wasn't a *bad* time, but I still missed my ex (hereby now referred to as 'B', because I'm not creative enough to come up with a nickname for her that isn't one of her initials), and was going no where in life working a dead end job at a gas station.

I reconnected with her a bit, but being the brash, arrogant dicksnap I'd become within the year that we had broken up, we ended up arguing (not something that happened more than in a healthy relationship), and I didn't talk to her for a while after that. Started dating a trashy girl, moved in with my grandparents' house.

During this time, I never stopped thinking about her. I still haven't. Got a new job at a department store that wasn't quite as dismal and shitty as working graveyard at a gas station. Started school again, not bad. Still thinking about B.

Talked to her on and off, blah blah; more whiny filler about how much I miss this amazing girl I left behind. Every time we talked it was like we were still dating, but we would eventually abruptly stop again, and it was beginning to be hard to deal with. We both went through SO's like water. I was never happy in a relationship without her - I'm still not.

More time passed, my grandpa died. Grandma moved out, I moved back in with the friends I had lived with in my high school days. She came down to our hometown to visit on holiday from Uni. She invited me to come see her, which would become the first time we saw each other in person in almost two and a half years. I still had some of her stuff stored away in the attic and my closet, so I figured it was a good enough time to go see her.

I was sweating bullets. By the time I got there I had already gone through my undershirt. The butterflies came back just the same as they always did. More than anything I just wanted to see her face again.

It was awesome. We just sat in her driveway for something like three hours, staring at the sky and catching up with each other. She spoke of college life, and the boys she dated and left behind. Her parents were home and are pretty strict (see also: insane), so we cut the night short, exchanged hugs, and promised to meet up again.

A few weeks later she was down for her mom's birthday, and we saw each other again. Went shopping, had fun, but didn't do anything not related to being only friends. 

She begged me to come up and stay at her dorm, but I just couldn't do it at the time. I had no money, or time. I told her I would as soon as I could.

Again she came down (this all happened within a period of about two months) for a weekend trip with her roommates. We met up for dinner, and it was obvious that there's still something there. We both wanted to embrace and start over, but that is somewhat inappropriate in a restaurant setting with her friends one table down from us. We parted again, and again she asked desperately for me to come up and see her, and even to hurry and finish college so I could go back to university. 

I couldn't. I wanted nothing more but to drop my life and go back to her, but it just wasn't possible. I had bills, and a job, and a life that I couldn't just drop and leave.

Fast forward to about a month ago. I've moved, not far, but definitely away into the city. I have a decent desk job and am finishing college. 

By now, we've both found new SO's (again), and the school year is ending. I told her I could drop by and see her if she wanted while I was up further north to visit a friend, but she was busy with finals and has an internship out of state for the summer, but that she'd be back in the fall. Before she leaves, though, she's coming back to our hometown (and coincidentally I will also be there when she will be) to visit her family. 

Her current boyfriend lives where the internship is (long distance relationship), but recently more than ever I've been dying to tell her how I feel.

I don't want her to go back to her boyfriend and forget about me. I feel guilty dating someone while contemplating this entire situation, but I can't help it. It's eating me up inside and I need to tell her, but I'm entirely too scared of what may come of it. 

None of the relationships I've had since her have worked out, and it's all because I always put her in front of whomever I'm dating. It's unfair to the girls getting pushed aside, and it's unfair to me to be in a relationship that I just don't want. Four semi-serious sounding relationships have come and gone for me, and I've been apathetic towards all of them because of how much love I still have for this unbelievable girl.

So, Reddit. What should I do? I don't want her to think I'm just some obsessed ex with an infatuation - it's not overtaking my life, but I feel like a large chunk of me is missing without her. I think she feels the same way, but I really can't tell, especially with her having a boyfriend and not being able to talk to her very often due to our busy schedules. 

I feel horrible telling her all of this now, but I always thought I'd just get over it like every other relationship I've had. I definitely haven't. It's still eating me up inside. 

It's so rude of me to bring this up while we're both dating people, I know. Has anyone else gone through something like this? What would you do in my situation? Tell her now so that she has the summer to dwell on it, or take a chance and wait until she gets back home to let her know?

**TL;DR:** The love of my life is still within reach, and I don't know how to tell her how I feel because I'm unsure of how she'll react to it.

I wasn't sure if this counts as 'relationship' advice, because right now we're not technically dating, but I still think of what we have as somewhat of a relationship. 

If this is inapplicable to the subreddit, or borders on being a rant, I really am sorry, guys. I'm just lost and looking for some guidance from someone other than my manly roommates.

Thank you in advance."

I learned later that this basically made me ""self employed,"" and my resulting IRS forms are a bit confusing.  I had it done with TurboTax but they discarded the info, so I have the paper forms.  I worked for 2 months in the summer and made less than 5K.

1)  Can I use a Schedule C-EZ instead of a C and SE form?  I didn't ""have"" a company, I was simply paid directly by check because this small startup didn't want to deal with the employment piece and passed the pain onto the interns to figure out.

2)  It looks like on the 1040 I need to put my income under line 12, Business Income or Loss.

3)  Guessing this should end up being my AGI, and if I use single standard deductions of $5800, I should have $0 for line 55 (this income was the only I had for the entire year, rest was loans/scholarships)

--Schedule C---

1)  Do I just put all my personal info for company address, etc. and leave company name blank?  I'm guessing that my intern ""wages"" are line 1a, which will eventually be line 7, gross income.


Okay, off to a meeting, thanks in advance for anyone that can steer me correctly."

I work in the IT Department as an intern, and I have the ability (and permission) to change anything necessary on my personal computer to get it fixed. I narrowed down that it's not a router/domain issue by using a different computer on the same domain and it was able to connect fine. 

It doesn't do this on any other site (that I've seen), and I did some research on it but didn't get very far: most just told me to make sure SSL 2.0 and TLS 1.2 are checked under Internet Options, which they are. I've tried different combinations of these two settings as well, though I'll change them again if anyone thinks a certain combination would work best. 

For reference, in Chrome I get the message:

In Mozilla Firefox, the error shows:

Just a few days ago, I suddenly began to feel depressed again, but for no real reason. I just feel really tired, and I have no motivation to do anything. I have an internship at a really cool company starting in a couple weeks, and I don't even feel excited at all. I can feel like its slowly getting worse. I woke up this morning, sat up and just didn't even want to move for like ten minutes as the feeling slowly set back in. My head has just felt really, odd, lately. 

Yesterday evening, all of a sudden, I mean like within seconds, I suddenly felt fine. Like great, the happiness slowly crept back into me and I almost felt like crying in relief. As night came though, and I laid in bed, it slowly crept back, and I went to sleep hoping it would be gone. And it didn't.

I'm only 19 and if this is depression, I don't want it to spiral out of control like it did those years ago. I want to feel excited and happy about things again.

Some background: I'm a wrapping up my sophomore year at UT Austin (McCombs). I'm double majoring in Finance and Economics, with a minor in Chinese language. I'm sitting at a 3.1 right now, should be up to about a 3.25 after finals this semester if everything goes the way I expect it will. I'll be looking for an internship in the fall.

Coming into school I thought I wanted to get into banking. After a few semesters it's become apparent that I'm not making the grades, and after a few of my friends going to work I don't think I want that life anyway.

I've interviewed for a few shitty data-entry positions with some local firms in varying industries for the summer (not many people want to take a chance on a sophomore with a 3.1) and I'm waiting to hear back.

I'm starting to think about oil though. McCombs has one of the better energy finance programs, they recruit heavily here, and the work-life balance is more in line with what I'm looking for. The problem is that living in Houston is a deal-breaker for me. My parents grew up there and I visit frequently (grandparents), and it is pretty much the last place in the world I'd want to call home.

Can anyone tell me about oil finance opportunities outside of Houston? I know ExxonMobil is headquartered in Irving, but aside from that what is there? What's the job market like? I know Shell has a really cush deal (as long as you put in 80 hours over two weeks and you can take every other Friday off), but is it the same with other firms? What are job opportunities like with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers vs. the refining companies?

Thanks for letting me outsource my career research!

Feel free to skip the somewhat technical parts.


*****
###Background information
*****

I'm a college student completing his last semester towards an Applied Computer Science bachelor's degree, ""majoring"" (for lack of a better analogy to the system in my country) in Mainframes. During this last semester I'm required to run an internship which I have, of course, chosen to do with a company that employs a Mainframe. In my case a bank whose name I will not disclose.

I finished the assignment for this internship halfway through the semester, leaving me with some spare time. And even though I only start up Minecraft sporadically to check up on Westeroscraft's progress, I had this crazy idea to run a Minecraft server on our IBM Mainframe. 


*****
###How to do it
*****

I managed to get it running in one afternoon, so I did not encounter too many problems but here they are anyways.

z/OS doesn't have a web browser, so I had to FTP-put the .jar file on to the Mainframe. I didn't expect it to run off the bat so I just followed the Minecraft Server Wiki step by step guide (I had only ever run a Minecraft Server under Windows) to see what I would bump in to. Java -version gave me an error that the JVM couldn't be started. Turns out the problem was that [my user didn't have a large enough address space](http://i.imgur.com/GVzHM7F.png) when I logged on.
When you log on to an IBM Mainframe, you are assigned an address space, or room to work in. This is comparable to the RAM you are provided with when you log in to Linux or Windows. Except the address space is virtual. Your LPAR can have 10 Gigabytes of RAM physically allocated to it yet you can have a couple hundred virtual Gigabytes being used by running tasks and users. You'd be stupid not to since the resources on a Mainframe are so fast you could never hope to saturate them with a 1:1 virtual:real ratio.

So back on topic; I had my address space enlarged. Turns out [company standards dictate the maximum you get per user is 8 megabytes](http://i.imgur.com/Lxlwi2J.png), which was enough to start a JVM to run java -version, but hardly enough to start a Minecraft Server. The default value was much less as to save space when people that don’t need large address spaces log on. This was why java –version didn’t work. [I bypassed the 8 Mb policy](http://i.imgur.com/d1VbeQt.png) by issueing a request for alteration and I now had [2 Gigabytes of address space](http://i.imgur.com/iUN41NX.png) to work with, quite comfortable I'd say.
 
So I was able to [start the Minecraft server](http://i.imgur.com/VgvD0zj.png) with the same terminal command you’d use on your Ubuntu or Fedora box. It created the map and was (hopefully) listening for connections. It wasn't throwing any errors so it appeared that the TCP/IP libraries (which I feared for the most) translated over flawlessly.

Next problem was not Mainframe related, but rather Bank related. When I fired up the Minecraft client on my workstation and tried to log in, I was unsurprisingly faced with a time out because the port, when trying to move data outside, was blocked, making it unable to reach the login server. No problem, I just went in to offline mode after copying my %appdata%/.minecraft folder from my home machine to my workstation. I added the DNS name of the LPAR on which the server was running to my server list and behold, it existed. When I tried to connect however, I received a timeout after 20 seconds. I could see on my terminal that I tried to connect but timed out. As I mentioned before, I've only sporadically ran Minecraft Servers in the past for a handful of friends on a home machine under Windows, so I'm not very familiar with the intricacies that come with Minecraft servers. It turns out that the Minecraft client authenticates itself to Mojang servers so that unique things such as names can't be forged (or anyone could log in with a name that is present on the administrator list). This however is not possible for me to do considering the Bank's network doesn't allow traffic to the outside over most ports. So I had to change the server.properties file, which the server had created, to run the server in unauthenticated mode. When I tried to edit it however, [it was all gibberish](http://i.imgur.com/STXAIJV.png)!

Something you might not be aware of is that Mainframes don't use ASCII or Unicode character sets, but EBCDIC, also known as the best way to encrypt data (that's a joke by the way, you’re pretty OG if you get it). The Minecraft server was writing the file in ASCII but the Mainframe can't read it (well it does, but the MC server writes “a” to disk as 0x61 and the Mainframe reads it as “/”). So I had to FTP-get it off of the Mainframe on to my ASCII-capable workstation, edit it, and FTP-put it back on. In binary mode mind you, because the Mainframe tries to convert to EBCDIC whenever you send files to it.
So now when I start up the server it's in unauthenticated mode.

[And that's all](http://i.imgur.com/J4SyXdc.png), I was able to [connect to the server with no problems.](http://i.imgur.com/KaBjfdz.png) I know the pictures could easily be forged, but I couldn't think of a fool proof way to prove this thing is running on a Mainframe without disclosing what company I interned at. So I hope that the level of detail that I'm going in to is enough to convince you.

The only sad part is that our workstations only have 3 Gigs of RAM and no GPU, so the frame rate is abysmal. As a result it's not possible to check the performance of the Minecraft server with the client itself. If you know of a way to test server performance without the need of a client that renders frames, please tell me.

###Our system
*****

For the sake of this post I'll mention what resources the server has at its disposal;
Our system consists of two z196 machines running 15 General Purpose CPs (Mainframe jargon for CPU) and 1 zIIP (CPU built specifically to run DB2, XML and Java workloads) each. These two machines run in what is called a Parallel Sysplex. [Feel free to read the wiki page about that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Parallel_Sysplex), it's one of the concepts that define the Mainframe and allow it to be as reliable as it is. Each machine also has 330 physical gigabytes of RAM.

All the LPARs started on our system allocate 30 logical CPs combined. Yes, even CPUs are virtual on a Mainframe. These things are so fast you need to double (or more)-load them to make them cost efficient and not run idle too much. These CPs are quad cores that run at 5.2Ghz, watercooling optional. But they're so specialized that you can't really compare them to consumer CPUs. Your and my CPU is a jack of all trades while the IBM CPs are specifically trained workhorses. The four different levels of CPU cache are stupid fast. And while 5.2Ghz might not sound that fast, it is magnitudes faster than consumer CPUs if you're running the right workloads on them.
Just to give you an idea, our systems handle about 40 million transactions (don't think money transactions, read up on [transaction systems](https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/basics/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.zos.zmidtrmg/zmiddle_8.htm)) every day. Two years ago at 20 million transactions a day this meant peaks of 1500 transactions a second. The average execution time of each transaction was 0.03 seconds. I don’t know how many transactions a second we peak at nowadays.

The LPAR on which I started the Minecraft server was one of two LPARs used to convey tests before new things are implemented on to developer, audit and production LPARs. For this reason they're the weakest of the LPARs as to not impact production system throughput. What this comes down to is that the LPAR on which the server ran was allocated 2 Logical CPs and 6 Gigabytes of RAM (it usually runs on 3 Gigabytes, it’s running 6 temporarily for tests concerning my assignment). Because of how many CPs are allocated to the other LPARs, this means that it was able to take up a maximum of 6% of all the CP power available on the Mainframe. The memory doesn’t matter much because the address space I reserved is virtual. I could have reserved 12 logical gigabytes and the Minecraft server wouldn’t have noticed because the, at that point inevitable, paging is so fast on a Mainframe.
Interesting note; the two production LPARs that handle transactions generated by things like eBanking services have about 21 Gigabytes each at their disposal. 21 Gigabytes goes a long way on a Mainframe running z/OS compared to some datacenters that need silly amounts of resources to keep things running.

I'm really wondering what kind of a system Westeroscraft is using. They can always migrate to mainframe, it'll only cost you a million to get started. Or two million if you want stupid amounts of assured uptime. Comes with DDoS protection. I doubt a Kickstarter would suffice though. Then again I’m not even sure if Westeroscraft is the heaviest server online at the moment. They’re the biggest one I know of anyways. I wonder what hardware/setup they use.

###Conclusion
*****

So this concludes my disquisition. I’m quite happy that I’ve successfully managed to start a Minecraft server on a Mainframe. It’s something that I wanted to at least try ever since I learned that IBM Mainframes can handle Java workloads. Not to mention it’s a great way to fill a slow Friday afternoon.

What makes me content is that I've managed to connect a relatively new concept with what is perceived by the general IT-initiated public as an old concept. I hope that those who read my post will understand that the Mainframe is no longer the concoction of boxes in an engineer-filled room. It's still a valid way of providing IT services. And not because of the need to retain legacy, but because the Mainframe is still very economically viable. It just happens to be so that the workloads in which Mainframes are specialized happen to be the workloads generated by institutes that are often out of the public eye.

When I went home Friday I withdrew some money from an ATM at one of the bank branches of the bank that I'm doing my internship with. It was the weirdest thing to realize that just hours ago I had worked on the same machine that was now processing my request.

I’ve also Googled a bit and I’m pretty sure that I’m the first person ever to (successfully) run a Minecraft server on a Mainframe. Or at the very least publish it. I’m willing to bet that it’s the most powerful hardware, and operating system too really, that a Minecraft server has ever run on.

If you read this far down I'd gather that you might be wondering if you can connect to the server and check it out for yourself. I'm sorry that due to bank policy, I'm going to have to disappoint you. The Mainframe doesn't allow connections outside of the Bank's network. To rub salt in the wound, we have a 100Mbps up and 100Mbps down connection for our workstations only, for the Mainframe itself it's likely way more. Our Mainframe would truly make a sick Minecraft server.

I'm genuinely surprised that I managed to write some 3000 words about this subject. Gives me somewhat of a reassuring feeling about the thesis I'm supposed to be writing right now. Sorry about the wall of text, I couldn't help myself I hope you enjoyed it.

**EDIT**;

Can we have a Mainframe flair for submissions? ;)

I've only been doing really serious job searching since January (between August and January I was helping my dad fix up the house, as well as helping my grandparents with errands and the like).

Recently, I was provided two offers with companies I had interviewed with.

The first place to make me an offer would be a better fit for my career path. However, it's only been offered as an internship with pay (albeit fairly low). I was originally interviewing for a full-time position, but they ended up not needing a full-time employee--at least, not until last week, when a position opened up due to somebody else leaving. Instead of offering me the full-time position, though, they just said they'd like to try me out via the internship position, and then if I fit, they'd give me the full position. So like I said, this position would be a better fit for my degree; but at the same time, it's a bit of a risk, because I may not end up getting the full position if they don't feel I fit with them.

The other offer is more solid. It's full-time, benefits included, etc. However, it's more on the tech support side. I'm very familiar with IT support, as I've been doing it since high school, but it's not *exactly* the career path I'd like to follow. It's worth mentioning, though, that this position has the added benefit of being around home, meaning I would be able to live at home without paying rent, and would be able to save up money faster.

Sorry that this isn't worded terribly well, I wrote it in somewhat of a hurry. But, that's my pickle, and if you guys can give me any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. If you need me to clarify anything, just let me know."

It wasn't a busy street, I'm even reluctant to call it one since it was a road between two busier ones, but there was still traffic there and there were still people walking by. It was pretty hot, 21C this early is pretty scorching early in the spring, at least where I live. She was still wearing a winter coat, and used it to cover her face from the sun. There were bugs around her and against her behind was a plastic box full of head cheese. I nearly drove past her, I wasn't disgusted that people weren't helping her, but I just felt like a dick for driving by. So, I went back and asked if she was okay. I didn't understand her response, she might've been Russian, which I'm awful at. She smelled like booze and piss. 

I started calling the emergency aid. This was the first time I had done this, so I was slightly anxious. Dealing with new things like this does that to me. Two guys my age had also drove by me, one of them stopped to check out what was going on. He made a astoundingly clever deduction that she was a drunk and then started to leave me. I realised that I didn't know what street I was exactly on, luckily the guy was better with streets than I will ever be. I feel like I messed up the call. I said that I found a person lying on the ground and what street she was on. The operator then started to ask me about the person, her age, gender, what seemed to be wrong with her, if she was responsive. I felt like I should've said these things without being asked for them. I was annoyed at that. The operator asked if I could wait by her until the ambulance came and I agreed, I didn't really want to, but saying no would've made me feel like a dick. I think I was put on hold too I couldn't really see with the sun, but I must've ended the call by accident. Then I just waited there awkwardly as people drove and walked by me. I placed my bike on the ground. I didn't want to sit down. The person was bothered by the sun. I kinda wished I could do something about that, but I couldn't be bothered. I thought about going behind her and blocking the sun from there. But it made me feel more awkward so I didn't. I started noticing signs and more describable things I could've told the operator. I had just given her the address in a hurry. I felt the stares of other people and it made me feel uncomfortable and I had slightly regretted sticking around to wait for the ambulance. 

I waited there for probably 15 to 20 minutes, I don't remember. At first they had turned the opposite way, I ran their way and waved my hands to get their attention. They drove next to me. There was a bald man with sunglasses, he didn't really even look like someone from a hospital, and two girls who looked like they were interns or something. First thing the man said was the woman was just sleeping, walked up to her, kicked her feet and told her to get up. He told her she isn't allowed to just sleep in the middle of the street. One of the girls joined in on berating the woman, the man kicked her feet again. Telling her to get up. The other girl came up to me, she was cute looking. I remember her being cute. She told me that they knew this person, that they had dealt with her before. I thought that was my sign to leave, so I turned around and walked to my bike, I heard the other girl join the rest of them on yelling at the woman and I drove away. When I was at the end of the street I let out an audible ""What the fuck?"" and few yards later I laughed.

Ok so this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.  Part of my college program is completing 600 hours in a lab.  My program is a biotech forensic course.  I am interning with a major Canadian biotech company and frankly i am pissed.  I am an unpaid intern doing work that is pretty much the exact same thing that people are being paid for.  I work in a high production lab processing food samples.

This company runs interns year round and has about 15 in my lab.  We make up a large percentage of their labor.  Personally i don't understand how this is not illegal. They have pretty much converted 15 potential paid jobs into free labor and we are talking about a company that probably makes billions.

Now i go in every day happy and do my work because i actually had to pay $2000 in tuition to work for fucking free.  I don't have a choice, but to complete this.

What are your opinion on these unpaid internships.  I think they should be banned or companies forced to pay interns at least minimum wage.  What about you guys?  Is this an issue we can get /r/Canada to rally behind?

Personally i plan on meeting with my MP about this.  I have also contacted another MP who i know about this issue and we have some sympathetic ears.

Well, I talked to him for a couple minutes while I waited to place my order and he seemed like a really nice guy, and I had my laptop with me at lunch so why, not, I'll go vote for him.

After I voted, I did some googling on him, and found a couple of articles about what happened to him:

[Tony Dowels' positive outlook, not his wheelchair, endears him to Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow](http://www.tampabay.com/sports/college/tony-dowels-positive-outlook-not-his-wheelchair-endears-him-to-florida/992477)

I thought two things: (1) Man, this kid didn't mention any of this when he handed me his voting link on a little piece of paper. (2) Wouldn't it be great if he got this? This is a kid from the Tampa area who, if he won the van, would use it to go back and forth to his internship with the Bucs this summer, not to mention give him some independence. 

For the record, I don't know this guy, and I'll probably never see him again, but if you guys could either go vote for him, or direct me to the right subreddit to x-post this, it'd be appreciated. I think I just had a moment today where I thought ""damn, it would really suck to lose the ability to walk and live normally for the rest of my life, and this guy has and has a more positive attitude than I do.""

Anyway, here's the link to vote: [http://www.mobilityawarenessmonth.com/entrant/antonio-dowels-tampa-fl](http://www.mobilityawarenessmonth.com/entrant/antonio-dowels-tampa-fl).

When I was a child I was put into a gifted kid's program and I've been in honors and AP courses ever since.

I couldn't wait to grow up because I had so much in store for my life. All everybody could see was how successful I was going to be when I grew up because I was smart and talented.

Well, not genius level, but common sense, and still fairly smart. Especially good at maths.

Growing up, I spent a lot of time on the computer. I ended up learning a lot HTML when I was 10, and programmed my first games when I was 11. I have never stopped using the computer since, and it has taken me seven years to realize that I wanted to do computer science when I grew up...


And everything felt wonderful for while. Until every organization started telling me I wasn't good enough for anything I wanted to do. I had so many dreams until all of this happened within one month.

I was denied from a math summer camp. I'm a 4.0 unweighted and two years ahead in math, future software engineer, rank 1 out of over 300 students. AP classes in calculus, compsci, physics. I thought it was because I wasn't poor enough but someone richer than me at school was chosen, and not me. All I can hope was that I was overqualified because I wasn't even waitlisted.

Then I wasn't chosen for this position about managing communications within a division of an organization. It didn't even matter if I qualified. Just mess up on an interview and life is unfair. I grew up making websites, and nothing was really going right. 

Lastly, I was rejected from a microsoft high school internship. I guess this kind of blew all my hopes and dreams away. It literally made my whole life feel USELESS because I obviously can't get into anything I apply for. I did more computer things than I listed, but even people with less programming experience were chosen and I'm just feeling like my life is a big pile of unfairness and everything sad.

All of this has made me so depressed. I started crying every day and thinking about ways to give myself a concussion so I can lose IQ and become more social-able. Obviously, that's a shitty idea, and then I realized I'm not thinking normal anymore.

My mother doesn't take my seriously because I'M JUST A TEENAGER. So that's right. I'm sixteen and I grew up being told that I was special and now I don't feel special anymore and it sucks. I can't deal with it by myself. 

I want my hard work to pay off. 
I want all of this to be worth it. 
I don't want to wait for success. 
I want to be happy now. 

My 4.0, AP courses, class rank. It's all useless. It's meaningless. Nobody seems to care about that anymore. Nobody even cares that I had so much passion for CS but now.... Now I feel ready to stop trying. "

As I have people I know graduating, I realize how much time my depression has taken from me. 

How unfortunately, I lack the things to be where I want to be.

And how I let fear pin me down and feed off me.

I’m trying 23 this year.

Twenty-fucking-three.

And I go on tumblr and see these awesome black alternative girls and I get sad, because I don’t have the money for nice clothes.

I have money to barely feed myself.

Truth is, I wear about the same set of jeans and shirts every week. I’m not sure if people have noticed, but it makes me feel so bad when I open my closet and realize I only have like 3 choices in jeans and maybe 7 in shirts.

Truth is, I only have two bras I wear interchangeably and they don’t even fit me properly.

Truth is, I’ve been splitting my paychecks in half, and putting it in a savings account.

Because when I somehow eventually get my license (if I ever), I can buy myself a car.

I feel bad for being jealous that everyone around me didn't have to work for one. Family members brought it for them, or passed it down.

But God, that independence… 

That will open so many doors for me.

Monday as I walk to Food Lion and back in the rain, three bags in one hand, trying to hold an umbrella, a sad image.

But that is my life. 

Everyone is getting or has internships in shit they want to do.

Due to no car, I can’t do that. 

I can’t find another possible high paying job somewhere else.

What am I doing with my life?

It’s been almost a week of break. I went to the movies once, which was nice. But so far it’s been me sitting inside as usual.

I can’t be like, “LET’S GO SOMEWHERE.” Because, it’s not up to me. 

I’m just grateful when people put up with giving me rides.

And now I just fucked up this past semester and may have to drop my english major.

And I just think, “Damn, why am I such a goddamn loser?”

Legit.

I wear the same clothes.

I may get teased that I take too long to get dressed when going out, but it’s because I never get that chance to try and make myself feel pretty.

I sit in the same damn place.

I do the same thing.

These 18-20 year girls on tumblr are living the life I want and I’m almost 23.

And I’m paranoid of losing time.

I’m awkward with people.

My body is all sorts of fucked up. Who the fuck even gets thick hair on their stomach?!

I am disgusting. :|

I can pop my back now, and when I stretch I crack.

My back hurts.

I am literally aging faster than I want to.

I always imagined myself by now being confident and a badass.

Who has awesome grades, which surprises people because she’s goth with piercings, but really, she’s a nice person.

Who doesn’t fucking let guys take advantage of her feelings and then cry cry cry. :|

And then on weekends she goes clubbing, or bowling, or a movie.

Who is comfortable with her money and doesn’t starve.

It sucks when I want to go get McDonalds or something because I’m hungry. But I can’t.

So I sit there.

I literally just am like, “Okay. Well…this sucks.”

Maybe I’m being whiny because I’m on my period.

I’m entering my senior year, and guess what?!

I am the same if not worse than when I entered.

Nope.

Nope.

Well…I’ma go cry now. I wish I had some icecream or something.

Stupid period."

Subject: As a fan, I'm incredibly disappointed by Valve's decisions regarding TI3 Tickets

I used to think that Valve was the last really ethical huge video game company out there. One that wasn't motivated by profit, one which tried, as much as possible, to put the consumer and gaming experience first. Every company makes mistakes, but I can scarcely believe that with all the smart, talented people working for Valve that something like the international 3 ticket debacle could happen.

I understand that Valve is a company that needs to make money, and I would never want to stand in the way of profit for no reason, but to me it seems that the entire TI3 ticket strategy was to maximise the profit over every ticket. They sell for $50, but then you made them so you can resell them on the Valve-controlled marketplace, taking off, what, 15% of the second sale? And you had to know that they'd sell for a great deal more. Cap is $200, so that's another $30 to Valve for free.

That's not what bothers me. I would pay your company $100 to see this event, but I'm disgusted by how this rewards scalpers. They buy 5 tickets at $50 each, sell them each for $200, and they've made $750 off the biggest fans of your game. I don't see how a company could be OK with that.

I'm coming to live in Seattle this summer to intern for Amazon. It's a good opportunity, and I thought I might take my time in the area to see TI3 (for which I had been excited since attending TI2 in person last year) and apply to other companies in the area. I'm good at writing web apps and banging out coding problems, but that's not what I wanted to do with my life. I want to make games, and I'm going to apply to the companies I believe I would want to be a part of. I no longer think Valve is one of them.

After I graduated I immediately found a job, but in an unrelated field.  Through my school's anthropology department I was introduced to, and fell in love with GIS. Considering that there are very few jobs for anthropology undergrads, I decided to sign up for an introductory GIS in order to pry my way in to the world of GIS and earn a certificate.  The intro class went very well and I found myself even helping out a lot of the geography majors who were struggling around me within the class.  However, i'm really starting to wonder how useful I will be to employers offering GIS related jobs who are not anthropology-based.

So my question is, is having a GIS certificate and an unrelated undergraduate degree enough for an entry level technician job, at the least?

Also, I realize that what may be even more important is presenting the actual work I have done, and my technical skill with using the program.  Which is why I plan on taking up an internship, given the opportunity, as well as work on academic GIS projects.

So, should I work on earning a certificate and building individual skill, or should I work on all that while also planning on earning a more applicable undergraduate degree?

Some background: I'm a wrapping up my sophomore year at UT Austin (McCombs). I'm double majoring in Finance and Economics, with a minor in Chinese language. I'm sitting at a 3.1 right now, should be up to about a 3.25 after finals this semester if everything goes the way I expect it will. I'll be looking for an internship in the fall.

Coming into school I thought I wanted to get into banking. After a few semesters it's become apparent that I'm not making the grades, and after a few of my friends going to work I don't think I want that life anyway. 

I've interviewed for a few shitty data-entry positions with some local firms in varying industries for the summer (not many people want to take a chance on a sophomore with a 3.1) and I'm waiting to hear back. 

I'm starting to think about oil though. McCombs has one of the better energy finance programs, they recruit heavily here, and the work-life balance is more in line with what I'm looking for. The problem is that living in Houston is a deal-breaker for me. My parents grew up there and I visit frequently (grandparents), and it is literally the last place in the world I'd want to call home. 

Can anyone tell me about oil finance opportunities outside of Houston? I know ExxonMobil is headquartered in Irving, but aside from that what is there?  What's the job market like? I know Shell has a really cush deal (as long as you put in 80 hours over two weeks and you can take every other Friday off), but is it the same with other firms? What are job opportunities like with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers vs. the refining companies?

Thanks for letting me outsource my career research!

EDIT: Oops, this is the first time I've gotten on my computer (originially posted from my phone), and just read the sidebar. I'll be x-posting this over at Finance Careers. Thanks for the advice guys!"

I just completed a 4 month work term during busy season and I got a return offer to go back again. My dilemma is that I don't know if I want to go back...

My career aspirations are to work in in the capital markets. I feel that being an accountant is not much relevant (tying numbers, obtaining support from the client, work on pointless documentation, etc.) to what I'm aiming for. I have no problems with the hours I work.

I was initially planning to obtain my CPA, go into TAS, and then go into the capital markets, but I am having second thoughts about this. I have 2 work terms remaining in my program (it can be either two 4 months work terms or one 8 month term, both from next Jan to August). Is it better to get my CPA and get into TAS, or should I just go for internships in the finance field?

I have had a hell of a month. A little background; about eight months ago I moved from my hometown with my husband to a different state. About five weeks ago my husband asked me for a divorce because I refused to have children. We had talked about this prior to marriage, and had always agreed to never have kids. I'm not sure what changed for him, but it did. So he divorced me. 

I found my own place and moved on my own for the first time in my life. I was excited, but scared. I work, but it's been hard to transition from buying what I wanted (he makes 120k a year, I made 20k) to having to be on a strict budget. I let him have everything in the divorce, except my dog and my motorcycle. 

I flew home for three days to see my family, and bought a car while I was home (they are a lot cheaper there). I drove my new 92 Trooper home and got a speeding ticket for going six miles over the limit. Fine, whatever, I can deal with it. Six days after taking a cash advance on my new CC to buy my car, I totaled it. I have never been in a car accident before and am still not sure what happened. I didn't have full coverage, so I am out the money. 
As this was happening I was in school full time set to graduate in June. However, this required a 40 hour per week internship. My work (I am an assistant manager at a retail store), was originally supportive of this. However, we had a GM change and she put me on probation for limited availability. I had my hours cut to only 12-15 per week (down from 40+). I was told by my new GM that this was going to be the way it was till I had availability again. So I made the tough decision to drop out of school till I could find a new, accommodating job. 
I also ended up in the hospital for two days for a lung infection during all of this, and was written up for calling off of a shift, even with a doctors note. 

To summarize, in about a month, I have been divorced, totaled a car, put myself into financial ruin, quit college, been hospitalized, and gotten put on probation at work. 

Not sure why I wrote this, but it feels good just to get it off my chest. Thanks for listening! "

I've got a 3.2 undergrad GPA and am taking the LSAT in June (I think I'll end up around 165). I'm ultimately trying to get into a school ranked in the 50s. My undergrad experience looks like this: I've got this 3.2 ish GPA, but I double majored in journalism and English and have some good extracurriculars like random part-time jobs during the school year, 3 full-time, paid summer internships, and 4 years of working at and eventually running the student newspaper.

Does this help compensate for my underwhelming GPA or am I over-thinking this? Also, I've worked for 2 years as a reporter, so I sort of feel like my undergrad could be overlooked. What are your thoughts?

Unfortunately, the companies on the eastside that I am finding myself somewhat interested in state ""interns must be enrolled in a bachelor program at a university"", which may or may not nix me out, but it seems to float on the former.

I'm a prospective chemE major. As a whole, I'm finding it somewhat hard to make connections as a CC student in eastside, since our career center is terrible, and no one seems eager to join an engineering club I'm trying to get together.

I asked my mom to go with me, since my husband had to work late tonight. When my mom asked me how long it would be, I told her maybe a half an hour - they'd ask me the routine questions, get my weight, BP, use the Doppler on my baby, and that should be it. 

Wrong.

During the questions, I told the midwife I was still having my 2-4 BH per hour, which has been normal for me since about 20 weeks. I laughed as I told her that I found it funny that they give us all these PSAs and brochures and pamphlets and I get emails from The Bump and WTEWYE about all the signs and symptoms of preterm labour, and that you should call your care provider *immediately* if you're experiencing any of them - and it seemed I had them all. She didn't laugh. When I told her that Arya has dropped three times since Wednesday only to rise again each time, and that I could feel her pushing against me when I put my hand down on my crotch, she got slightly concerned. She suggested a cervical check. 

She inserted her fingers and I grimaced and yelped s bit, as any kind of penetration has been excruciatingly painful for me since about week 10 (I explained that to her). Turns out I'm fingertip dilated, about 30% effaced, and very soft. She also decided to do an exam and swab for bacterial vaginosis after I told her how painful it was when even just her two fingers were inserted. Positive.

So it seems that I've had an infection since at least week 10, which has most likely been causing my crazy amounts of contractions, severe back pain, excruciating pain during sex, and is causing me to dilate/efface prematurely. I've been prescribed something for it and am going to pick it up in the morning.

I also got lectured by three midwives and two interns about how I need to call them when I'm having issues. I told them that I don't want to be the woman who calls every time she feels a little funny or has a silly question every five minutes. They got upset with me and said that's what they're there for, and they want me to be well and they want to know what's going on.

They also told me that I will be on weekly appointments now to monitor my cervix and make sure it doesn't change anymore. They said they're not super concerned about it, but that everyone needs to be on alert. 

On the one hand, I'm really happy that we found this out. Within 48 hours I should have relief from most, if not all, of my symptoms. What a relief. Also, in all my worrying about being a baby, it's nice to know that my symptoms ARE abnormal, and that I SHOULDN'T be going through all of this.

So here's my PSA: don't try to stick it out! Call your doctor or midwife if you think something is wrong, and don't let your pride get in the way of your health or your baby's health. Also, for the ladies who are experiencing horrible pain during sex, it might be an infection! Get checked! You might find relief, and won't need to suffer for 22 weeks like I have!

TLDR: Turns out I'm dilating/effacing prematurely. It's my fault for preferring my pride over calling my midwives with my preterm labor symptoms. All should be well, but I'm on weekly appointments just to be sure. "

I'm a mechanical engineer recently graduated from a university that taught drafting for engineers using SolidWorks.  During my internships, I stayed on board with a company that using Pro/Engineer Wildfire 4.  I used it a little bit, just for measuring parts.

I've now graduated (yay!) and I'm working at another company, that also uses Pro/E Wildfire 4.  Now I'm doing some design work, and getting... ""introduced"" to everything Pro/E needs to throw at you for you to create complete parts, drawings, and assemblies.  Now that I've learned it a good bit, I want to say that Pro/E SUCKS.  The user interface is clunky, bloated, and nonintuitive, errors offer little explanation, and all the implementation details seem to lack polish, and it is generally frustrating to use!

Comparing this to SolidWorks, for example, is almost not even a fair comparison in my opinion.  The non-terrible user experience in SolidWorks probably yields double the real-world productivity compared to the same task being performed in Pro/E.  I've been told by some of the older guys at my company that Pro/E isn't that bad- but I'm inclined to believe that they only stick to that opinion because they've molded their perceptions to accommodate it after using it for years.  I've also been told that the additional powerful features Pro/E has make up for the differences- but I don't see them being important for our company, where the geometric details of our manufactured products are not too terribly complicated.

I know that Creo has taken over as the replacement for Pro/E, but I think this is still a relevant question, given Pro/E's still-large use in industry. 

So guys, what do you think of Pro/E?"

I took a class that looked at the area a bit more in depth even though it wouldn't count towards my degree, and started applying for jobs all over the place. I only got calls back from three locations, one was this company, and two others were positions which I thought would be more exciting, as they involved more traveling. Then I got the job offer from this company, and the details of the job (perks are rather nice for what I want in life right now, and it is a longer assignment than I had expected, plus I got a good vibe from my future boss and coworkers during the interview), and I realized it is an opportunity to learn a lot more and to hopefully end up with a more permanent job at a company that, by its nature, is forced to care about the people that it serves and the environment.

The author's situation seems pretty similar to mine.  Here is my situation summed up in bullet points:

* Graduated with BSCS from a highly ranked university with low gpa
* Had a few internships at reputable companies during college
* Unsuccessful with job search (1.5 years) focused around the bay area, even with recs from friends
* Probably had hundreds of phone screens and several on campus interviews, but no offers
* Accepted into MSCS program at local school, but haven't enrolled yet
* A little awkward at first encounters, but otherwise sociable (1000+ friends on fb)

**What's your best advice for me now?**

  I think I am a competent programmer in that I can reliably churn out stuff, even if it's not the most elegant or efficient.  I haven't been doing that many side projects during my time off from school.  Open source projects (especial big ones) are kinda intimidating.  Been just playing around with new frameworks and doing stuff like project euler to keep my skills sharp.


*Edit: Typo, I meant 1000 instead of 2000 friends on facebook.  In case you're wondering, it's because I did a lot of random clubs in college so I met a lot of people*"

I got along with a few other people from my university and other Americans, but the people in the country I went were not very friendly (which is probably a biased cultural perception). 

After the first week, I put up a calendar counting down the days until I could go home. It seemed like each day was a month long and I remember telling myself ""5 more hours, 4 more hours"" etc until I could get home. I had an awful 2-hour commute one-way to/from work every day. I stayed in my room a lot watching TV shows on my computer and eating. I think I might have been depressed. 

The last night I was there, a guy somewhat assaulted me in a club (I was very inebriated, he led me to a corner despite my protests and tried to get in my pants [thank everything I was wearing high waisted tights under my skirt]) and that didn't really even phase me at the time... looking back, it was actually quite a terrible experience that I didn't take seriously. When I got back to the US, I had never been happier to be an American and return to the country I sometimes scorned.

I got home and told everyone I had the summer of my life. I lie my ass off every time I'm asked about it. I spent a ton of money on this ""opportunity"" and I feel like I squandered it by being pathetic.

the main reason i'm asking this is that i was just accepted off the waitlist for UC davis as a neurobiology, physiology, and behavior major and i know that i can work with animals there without doing animal science and that i'll be well prepared for veterinary school after my four years at davis. i'd much rather attend cal poly because i like it better overall, but if it can't give me the tools i need to get into vet school then i might have to withdraw and attend UC davis instead... :/ so if anyone has any information related to this that'd be super awesome!"

Tech firms won't even look at my resume because I don't have a BS in Computer Science or Info Sys and I have no real experience working in an editing or writing position to which I can speak of on a resume.

I'm not going to bore you with the process of becoming one so just take my word for it when I say it's a long process that spans over months to a year with some departments, the field of candidates is cut-throat competitive, and it sucks.  The interviews, assessments, exams, and polygraphs pulls the life out of you. After a polygraph or oral board you literally want to go home, crawl into a ball and die. I've been through this process multiple times with multiple agencies only to eventually be told, ""sorry, we've moved on with other candidates.""

Finally, about a week ago, I was offered a full-time position as a city police officer. Here's the catcher: it's in West Virginia. Now, there's nothing wrong with West Virginia, but as a gaybro things can get a little hazy. 

The department is very small in size and numbers. I hate to say it, but we're all white dudes in a 98% white town (no racism implied, only showing that diversity doesn't exist). So far I love all my coworkers. In law enforcement there's a special bond you won't find anywhere else but military. 

I start patrol here shortly. In my internship and every ride along you learn everything there is to know about each other. Eight hours of sitting in a cruiser you talk about everything, and with guys you always talk about girls, girlfriends, sexy girls, just normal guy talk. 

Right now I live in Columbus. I'm out of the closet and I am quasi-involved with the LGBTQABC123:-) community. I'm trying to prepare for the guy talk of girls. Already my chief asked if I had a girlfriend then we (or he) started talking about hot women. Considering the size of the department, my rookie status, and the lack of any gays in the area, I'm wondering if I should just come right out and say, ""I'm fabulous,"" ""yeah that girls tits are rockin,"" or stay silent. I normally take the silent route which always throws out indicators and that's perfectly cool with me. In the academy and my internship everyone caught on pretty quickly and I allowed them to gossip or straight up ask me - I like this approach. But, I'm wondering what you guys would do. Has anyone been put into this world before?

Also consider a few years ago in the county next door an openly gay officer called out an ""officer needs assistance (the most SERIOUS call there is)"" and no one showed up. He got the ass kicked out of him by the bad guys and quit shortly after.

1e18sv,1,2013-05-09,After creeping for 4 months I finally feel brave enough to ask: How can I turn my life around in the next 2-5 years to become a competitive accounting professional?,pr322,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1e18sv/after_creeping_for_4_months_i_finally_feel_brave/,"I graduated high school in 2008 with a 3.88 GPA and an advanced diploma. I started college with a full tuition scholarship, immediately got several leadership positions in student organizations, had a healthy social life and overall felt proud and confident of myself. After my freshman year in college, I sunk into horrific episode of depression that I couldn't manage to control until January of this year. This means that between 2009 - 2012, I either failed classes completely or got A grades. Rarely something in between. In the spring of 2012, I obtained a 3.4 semester GPA and slowly got my life back together. I have one more class to finish this summer, and will be graduating in August 2013 with a BA in Economics and roughly 2.14 cumulative GPA. 

This past semester, I enrolled in an introductory financial accounting class. It was incredibly fulfilling and I enjoyed every last minute. I know one class can't be enough to decide on a career path, so I've stalked r/accounting, read several books on entering the profession, and met two accountants for lengthy information interviews. After thinking about it for a few months, I realized I am sincerely interested in being a ""winner"" in life again and want to get a job the accounting field. Big 4 would be great, but I'm not obsessed with prestige aspect of it, I just want to get a job where I can learn more and hone my skills. I know I messed up a lot, and am prepared to do whatever it takes for the next 2-5 years to become a competitive accounting professional. 

Please share any general advice you may have about what I should be doing in the short run (next 6 months) and long run. Is it even possible for someone like me to work their way to a Big 4 in the next few years? 

Or, give me specific feedback on the following ideas: 

1. This summer, I am going to email all the top 50 accounting firm recruiting reps in the DC metro area and see if they are willing to give me a quick meeting. I will talk to anyone who is willing to give me a chance and figure out what I can do to be eligible for an internship next summer. What can I do to improve my chances of landing a good internship? 

2. I will take an accounting classes at a local community college over the course of the next 1.5 - 2 years in order to meet the CPA education requirements. I plan on maintaining a GPA over 3.5 if it kills me, and then passing the CPA. However, I live in Washington DC, where the accounting community is really well educated. Will community college course GPA be taken seriously by top accounting firms? 

3. I've also heard that it is possible to get into a Masters in Accounting program (especially ones like William &amp; Mary, where they are open to recruiting from non accounting backgrounds) with a killer GMAT score. What are your thoughts on that? Is it even possible to get into a program with a GPA like mine?

1e1792,4,2013-05-09,19 [M4F] Anywhere - Friend(s) please?,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1e1792/19_m4f_anywhere_friends_please/,"Hi all,

I'm looking for a friend, as the title of this post shows. I'm pretty lonely most of the time, and I'm looking for somebody to help me pass the time. After getting out of a pretty abusive relationship that lasted the majority of my high school ""life"", I'm left with no friends, and nobody to talk to.

About me: I'm a 19 year old guy, who is introverted. That being said, it's not easy for me to make friends. I'm looking for somebody who I can relate to, and have intellectual conversations with. I want to hear about your day, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I want to tell you about mine. I enjoy reading SciFI, Fantasy, Non-fiction, and many other genres. Reading is one of my biggest past times, and I easily become addicted to book series, along with all the lore related. I'm an apathetic atheist, and don't want to be badgered with religious beliefs. I'm currently going to university, studying CompSci, and I have 3 internships a week. 

What I'm looking for: A beautiful personality. Somebody to help my day go along via text/email. I want a friend who can make me happy, and somebody who will take her time and get to know the true me. I may be rigid when we first meet, but I warm up quickly to people, and am very loyal to those who actually respect and understand me. All races, ages, and shapes are welcome. I prefer to talk to older females, because they're more mature than my current shitty generation. (I'm not specifically looking for a relationship, but if one forms after a long amount of time, so be it. I will let you know if I'm interested.)

What I'm not looking for: Somebody who will stop talking to me after a day. (This makes me very sad, and hurts me.) I'm not looking for a bitch. (You know if you are one.) I'm not looking for a fwb. I'm not looking for somebody who I can sext. 

If you're interested, send me a PM, and ask me anything. c:

I was looking for some college/career advice before I graduate to improve my chances of getting a job or into graduate school. I am a senior Chemical Engineering(ChE) major who will graduate next May. I have been worried about graduating and  not finding a job after graduation. I have no work experience and a gpa around 3.1. I did not find a job this summer for the various engineering majors I applied for. Instead, I will be doing independent study with an professor to help put something on my resume besides academics. I have had a hard time with talking to companies at career fairs due to having no work experience and a mediocre gpa. I did apply online with many companies but only got a few responses. I have also been applying to positions outside my major (or related).

I was looking for ways to improve my chances of getting hired before graduating. I am considering applying for summer 2014 internship opportunities if I can, even though I am a senior. I am also planning on doing another independent study with an professor in the spring and perhaps taking a couple easy classes to boost my gpa. If you guys have any suggestions on what I can do, that would be great. 

I did have a friend that found an internship with a high 2.XX gpa and no work experience with a decent company in mid spring due to the company recruiting last minute, so I know there may be hope out there.

Thanks!"

I'm a junior studying Electrical Engineering. Needless to say I'm at a point where I need some internship experience but I havent been able to get any. I think part of the reason is I began my degree a little late and I havent really taken all the core classes yet. But I don't really understand how none of the 40+ postings I've applied to bothered to have me for an interview. I don't think my resume is the problem here because I had it looked at by a few people (or maybe it's so bad there's no fixing it).

My question is, what do you do before or after you apply to higher your chance of getting an internship position? I know you can always call the place but I don't even know where or who to call.

Any advice would be appreciated.

I made the *mistake* of getting a girl pregnant around two years ago. My son is now 16 months old. I had been dating his mom for the past year.

In this year, she's cheated on me. I've paid her child support even though we were dating and I've been in his life. I do not and have not been living with her. I make okay money, 38k before taxes. I was giving her $500 a month (What a fool..).

I've finally had it with the lies, the bullshit, the greed, the selfishness. I have absolutely no custodial rights to my Son. She refuses to put me on the birth certificate. I have met with an attorney, but I'm not entirely sure I like the outlook.

I would prefer joint custody of my son. I have no problem paying child support. He's mine, I love him. I've played by their rules for about a year (not taking him out of town, not staying at my home).

Her and her mom have a history of domestic violence. I'm not sure if this would make a difference in court. Basically, I can keep doing what I'm doing (being glued to their house to see him), paying $500 a month and having nearly no rights.. or I can pay my attorney and see my son every other weekend.

I currently see him thurs night, fri night, all day saturday and all day sunday.

I own my home. I do not do drugs. I do smoke, horrible habit. I don't want to fuck with this girls life, but she's fucking with mine. 

One more detail, she's an intern at the local PD and she's friends with many of the cops. Around 2 weeks ago we had a fight, verbal over the phone. I told her to leave me alone. At this point she had a key to my home. I refused to answer her calls. She said she was coming to my house.

I told her not to, I then barricaded the door so she couldn't come in. She's fairly small (around 100lbs) so I didn't think she could get in. Wrong. She got in, got in my face. She attempted to kiss me. I ran out the door and took off as fast as I could. 

Remember when I said she had cheated? I caught her at a cops house on 4/21/13. We shared a cell phone plan, I did a search on his number. 2000 texts in a month. 

I stayed away from my house for around 2 hours. I finally go home. I find the back door wide open, the thermostat to the furnace was set as high as possible. It was around 2:00am. Great, there's a knock on the door.

It's the fucking police. Guess who it is? It's the cop who she's been texting/hanging out with. They ask me some questions, she claimed I spit in her face. They ask if she had hit me etc, I told them no. They looked for marks, they found a scratch. Nobody was arrested.

He had a partner with him. I have a recording of her coming into my house (Mostly audio) you can hear the door being kicked. 

I also have a recording of her knocking for 10+ minutes. I have a recording of the police as well. 

This seems very rambly, I may have missed some details. I'll go through it when I'm not at work and correct any errors.

TL;DR kids mom has full custody of our son, I was paying child support (it's not court ordered) but I've recently stopped. She went crazy."

thank you for reading this post. I am a Master Student International Organization and International Relations ([http://www.rug.nl/masters/international-relations-and-international-organization/](http://www.rug.nl/masters/international-relations-and-international-organization/)) at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands looking for an internship in NYC.

Besides my Master, I have a bachelor degree in Information Technology (Essentially: programming.). At the moment I am working as a founder and co-owner (since a year and a half) of an IT-related business here in the Netherlands (http://www.noverius.nl). I am a social person, a quick learner, independent and driven. 

Ideally, the internship would have some link to international relations/international organization, but the only actual requirements for the internship are that they are a) of sufficient academic level and b) have an international character. As such, viable internships range from international investment banks to non-profits such as amnesty international. 

Given that I am a currently co-owner of a profitable company, preferably the internship would not last more than 3-4 months (since any longer would be hard to sell to my fellow business partners). Longer is possible; however, since in that case I would have to step down from my position as business owner, actual opportunities in regards to eventual employment or participation would be appreciated.

If you have any questions for me, if you wish to ask me about my previous experience or a resume, I will be happy to answer here or in a PM.

Kind Regards,

I graduated in December with a BSME and haven't had much luck at all with the job search. I had a mediocre GPA and no internships so I understand why its been hard. With no offers and only a few interviews for the past 5 months I'm starting to get a little desperate.

I recently got called for an interview for a very low paying sales engineering position with a small electric motor company. Unfortunately  I don't know much else about the company or what the job duties will be. The guy I spoke to made it sound like it would be a little more technical than just trying to sell electric motors, but I don't know if he was just trying to make the position sound more appealing. So my worry with this position would be that if I am successful and get the position that it might screw my chances of getting a more technical job later on. I would rather do technical/design work but like I said I am running out of options (not that I had many to begin with).

So if there are any past or current sales engineers out there that have tried to switch fields, how did it go?"

1e0ppx,0,2013-05-09,Starting an outsourcing firm,outsourceTHRWAWAY,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1e0ppx/starting_an_outsourcing_firm/,"Hi all,

Background info: 
I'm a college senior who is currently studying Business Admin and CIS. I have a partner who is also a Business student. My partner and I are both currently located in Southern California. I'm from the Silicon Valley, and my partner is from India.

As business students, we've noticed all those people who want to start various apps/websites/etc. Problem with this is that they do not have the technical know how to implement any of their ideas, and they do not have the sufficient capital to hire a team of coders (which leads them to pissing people off by offering unpaid internships). 

I have a few friends who have used freelancer.com, and other online outsourcing websites, but all of them have been unhappy with the results for a variety of reasons (mainly due to lack of communication). 

We realized that we can use our capabilities/resources to create an ideal solution; my partner can get a team of coders together in India and we can afford to pay them a going rate. I can communicate with the emerging startups here and act as the middle man between the startup company and the team in India. 

The company will guarantee communication; if the customer wants to chat with the team, we will set up a video conference within 12-18 hours to talk about progress, etc. We plan on treating our team with a lot of love (we will provide them new Macbooks, a nice office, etc). 

I have a pretty thorough understanding about the Software development process. I understand that things like gathering requirements, and documentation are prime areas for failure due to the communication gap. Those are the two things that I can work on from the States (I'll eventually have a team here to do that). 


I understand that I need to do a lot of research, etc, but before doing any of that, I just want to see what the /r/entrepreneur community thinks about this.

tl;dr: 2 partners (1 American, 1 Indian) want to start an outsourcing firm aimed towards startups who have an idea but not enough resources to implement that idea in The States. We will offer a better quality product than websites like freelancer.com"

I'm a recent college grad (sort of) and I'm looking to get an iPad before I go off to my music therapy internship for a few reasons. Primarily, I'd like it to have a more portable device that I can transport things like songbooks, etc so I don't have to carry around giant books and binders full of music. Second, I like the idea of being able to pull up music during a music therapy session if a client requests it. Third, I think it would be a nice, portable way to be able to do documentation right after sessions.

That being said, I need help. I know the iPad 4 has been out for a while, and the iPad 5 is due to come out... soonish? I was wondering if you guys thought it would be better to hold out and get the iPad 5 (not being able to guarantee that I'd have it before I moved to the middle of nowhere for my internship) or if I should go for the iPad 4 because it'll be a little less expensive, but it'll still run great.

Thanks for your help!"

How to proceed?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1e0l6e/came_to_college_unsure_of_what_i_wanted_to_do_and/,"So I entered college not knowing what I wanted to do with my life and, lo and behold, I am in the same place now that I am about to graduate. 

I'm graduating summa cum laude from a Top-50 school. I am graduating sans student loans thanks to a hefty scholarship from the school, so I am (in theory) free to take a job at any salary. I majored in the liberal arts on the advice that HR cares more about your work experience than your major. I've had three internships, one in publishing, one in advertising, and one in business dev. The first two turned me off to the idea of working in either industry. The last one was boring, unfulfilling, and it felt like a dead end career - but it looks good on my resume. I am starting to think that the typical cubicle gig is not for me, but I don't know what other options I have. 

My question is not: What should I do with my life? My question is: How do I figure out what to do with my life? 

* Should I suck it up and get a decent paying job in biz dev, even if I don't like it and don't want to end up in the field? 
* Should I take on yet another internship over the summer, even though I'd have to pay at least $2000 for housing costs and food? 
* Should I talk to people in separate fields I might be interested in and try to shadow people in a variety of professions? 
* Should I spend a year volunteering, dealing with the opportunity costs of a lost salary in order to discern what I want to do with my life? 
* Should I try to start my own company even though I have no capital and little experience?

I enjoy writing, but I don't see it as a career. I see it as something to do on the side, and it doesn't matter whether or not I make money doing it. Otherwise, I don't have any other tangible talents that I could freelance.

Any advice is much appreciated. If you are doing what you want to do, please tell me your story. And if you're dissatisfied with your job, please also voice your story and maybe help me learn from mistakes or misconceptions. Thank you in advance.

I will be riding around Northern NJ and the border of NY (Ramapo Mountain/Ringwood area - if that helps) So is a trail bike the right type for me?

Because I'm supposed to be graduating this scholarship program has been loading on these ""events"", one lasted an entire weekday and was off campus. I didn't go because I wanted to attend the classes I was currently failing so I could speak with my professor(who notoriously won't answer emails and has a day job so he's not able to schedule around students).

Ok so this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. Part of my shilling program is completing 600 hours on /r/canada. My program is a ""how to win friends and influence people"" course. I am interning with a major Canadian Political Cparty and frankly i am pissed. I am an unpaid intern doing work that is pretty much the exact same thing that people are being paid for. I work in a high production computer lab processing large amounts of leftist bullshit.

This company runs interns year round and has about 15 in my lab. We make up a large percentage of their labor. Personally i don't understand how this is not illegal. They have pretty much converted 15 potential paid jobs into free labor and we are talking about a party that probably makes billions.

Now i go in every day happy and do my work because i actually had to pay this party the maximum of $1100 to shill for fucking free. I don't have a choice, but to complete this if I wish to ever dine at the same table as Dear Leader.

What are your opinion on these unpaid internships. I think they should be banned or companies forced to pay shill interns at least minimum wage. What about you guys? Is this an issue we can get /r/Metacanada to rally behind?

Personally i plan on meeting with my MP about this. I have also contacted another MP who i know about this issue and we have some sympathetic ears.

At my job, the microcontroller board comes with a rapid development platform that includes templates that take care of loading the RTOS and setting everything up.  I've been trying to read the code in the templates, but I think this platform may be a little too complicated for me as a beginner to follow.  Here are my questions:

1.  In the real world, do most microcontrollers come with some sort of startup/initialization code, or would that be the embedded systems developer's job to write?

2.  Can you recommend any resources for learning how to write startup code?"

I'm an econ/math undergrad. I've taken a few stat classes but haven't gotten to much of the higher level math stuff yet. I'm interested in getting involved with data science, and I'm looking for tips to find an internship.

I've been taking some Coursera modules (social media network analysis, data mining, intro to data science...), I've nearly finished the Java and Python modules on Code Academy, and I started a blog in January where I make weekly posts doing some sort of analysis, so far most of it has been stat based and inside of Excel (pivot tables and charts).

I'm really eager to learn which is why I've been taking all these outside classroom lessons. I'll hit up some more advanced courses in the fall but I was really looking for a chance to do something over the summer.

I was wondering if there might be some way to approach companies that aren't obvious choices for more qualified students (like IBM) where I could get a chance to get some experience.

So our relationship has already been incredibly strained. I'll be moving back to the area at the end of the month, so breaking it off now feels like a wasted effort.

His paid internship ends in a few weeks. He just found out that a job he wanted to apply to went to someone else (he never submitted his application and resume, although he was working on them.) This just sent him into a spiral of depression. Now he feels like he's completely failed and he doesn't deserve success, and so on, etc. Actually at this point, he sounds like a broken record. He reacts this way every time something doesn't go right. Every little thing is an excuse for him to unload on me about how terrible his life is.

I've tried getting him to go to therapy. He countered with ""he can't afford it,"" so I did some research and compiled a list of free and reduced cost services in the area where he can go to get help with his issues. Now he says he doesn't have the time. I don't know what else to do for him. I can't be his therapist, I'm not at all qualified and anyway I have my own issues to deal with. No matter what I say to him, I can't get him to act rationally about the events in his life. He completely ignores the fact that I'm also going through a difficult job hunt and I'm facing the same consequences as he is if I can't find work. (Worse -- he has family he can turn to, but I'm on my own entirely.) But that's not important to him, it's always about him and his problems and how the world hates him. It's all he ever wants to talk about.

I don't want to give up on this relationship because when it's good, it's really good. I just can't handle his problems and he continually makes excuses for why he hasn't gone to get help. What can I do? Is there any hope for us? What can I say that will get him to seek help?

1dzr1u,1,2013-05-09,I'm not sure the path I'm taking in college will be a path I'll enjoy for the rest of my life.,confessionyguy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1dzr1u/im_not_sure_the_path_im_taking_in_college_will_be/,"I've switched majors a few times. I entered college as pre-med biology. My reasoning was thin and immature: I have many older siblings in all different fields, doctor isn't one of them; I enjoy the show scrubs; I like helping people; I did well and enjoyed Biology in high school.

However, I was stressed about the work and dedication involved in that major as well as the career after it. I told myself that maybe I wouldn't be able to deal with failing to cure people. Or that 80+ work weeks weren't worth it. I decided to change majors.

I was taking a math class and because I was enjoying the topic and doing well in the course I thought that maybe I could become a teacher of math, high school level. I liked my Calculus teacher;  I really enjoy teaching things to people; I like that math just has a solution, unlike other less tangible topics. I tried being a Mathematics major, even planning out my course schedule for the rest of college. Then, taking Calc III and Linear Alg at once (probably poor decision), I realized I didn't like math *that* much. I changed majors.

I like computers and video games. I was taking a intro to java course. I thought, with my joy of 'tinkering' with programs and game emulators, I might enjoy programming for a living. Progamming courses are time-consuming. With my ADD assignments take my 12 or more hours that take friends 2 to 4. I have a paid internship in computer science, and a degree from my school would really pull me through.

 But sometimes I start to think about the life of a programmer, and maybe I was better off a pre-med, or maybe I should try being a teacher again. But it's too late. This school is expensive. I have a very generous grant, but I feel like I'm squandering it with my indecision and my inability to do well in classes. I'm silently stressing myself out but barely voice it to others. I don't know when my grant will run out, and I'm afraid I might not even pass this semester. My school is hard, but are other schools going to be any different honestly? Calc is Calc, programming is programming.

I enjoyed just pushing carts at a store while in high school. Now working in an office setting makes me worry about the fact that I finish my tasks too quickly and I really shouldn't have as many hours as I ought to. Or I waste too much time at work, perhaps in the real world my employer will find that I don't output enough code. What do I do then? Stress upon stress upon stress."
1dzpoh,5,2013-05-09,I feel unworthy of asking my Ivy League LD-FWB to be with me.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1dzpoh/i_feel_unworthy_of_asking_my_ivy_league_ldfwb_to/,"I (22F) met this guy (26M) [let's call him Ryan] spring of 2010. We dated a few times right before I went away on a summer trip and he left to start business school at an Ivy-league (relevant later on) school on the other side of the country. 



I assumed that would be the end of it. An awesome summer fling. But no. Our undergrad college is in his hometown. Turns out, whenever he would come home for the holidays, we saw each other. We decided to be FWB, which we defined as: actually friends, sexually monogamous, and still requires a break up. 



When we met, I was a virgin. I was pretty close to having PIV sex with a previous bf, but other issues made me not trust him enough to take that final leap. It was not the case with Ryan. He was always very straight-forward about how he really liked me, but it wouldn't be fair for us to be anything more when he's away. And his actions reflect that. I really trust him. We are also very sexually compatible and like to explore the same things. We eventually went ""all the way"" about 10 months into it. My first time was wonderful, with someone I really cared about and trusted.

At some point, about a year after it all began, I asked him if distance wasn't a factor, would he see us together, or would he want to at all. I told him I have realized I do want an actual partner-in-crime share-our-darkest thoughts type of relationship, and I needed to know if that could be possible with him if distance wasn't a factor. He wouldn't give me a straight ""yes"" or ""no"". 

His answer was that there was no point in thinking about it because he's in the east coast and I'm in the west coast, and when we both graduate (me from undergrad, him from business school), we could still be far away depending on where our jobs take us. He doesn't want me to ""wait for him"" because he might not come back to his hometown if a better job opportunity arose somewhere else. And he doesn't want to have a serious relationship while apart (which, I agree with him on that part).


Last December (2012), he initiated a talk as he drove me to the airport, after I had mentioned that we've known each other for over a year. He wanted to make sure that I know he's not looking for a serious relationship. Right now his mind is in his career and nothing at all. He's not even thinking about relationships AT ALL. I took his word for it, but I'm also afraid this was a kind way of saying, ""I don't want a relationship *with you*. He said that both of us are, in a sense, using each other. He said it was hard for him to have this conversation, but he felt like he needed to have it bc it has happened to him in the past, where he has similar situations with girls, and they wouldn't move on. He didn't want to, but he cut them off 100% so they could move on. He likes me, and wants me to stay in his life. I will admit, I was offended that he thought he would ever be a better judge of what is best for a partner than the parter herself. I told him if he ever wants to end it, to end it because he's bored, found someone else, or whatever... not ""for my sake"". That's very condescending. I told him I'd worry about myself and my ""moving on"". I also told him I didn't want a serious relationship, bc I am only 22. But after thinking about it on the plane ride, I realized we both could've meant very different things by ""serious relationship"". When I say I wasn't looking for a serious relationship, I meant that am not assessing boyfriends for the potential to spend our lives together. But I do want **A** relationship. 

Since I got those answers, I have made an active effort to date. Truth be told, I haven't been on more than 4 dates since then, all of which were first dates that never progressed. It's just that the number of guys I find attractive enough to flirt with is significantly less than when he wasn't in the picture. Most of the time, when I want to feel close/wanted/horny or anything else that might lead to me reaching out to other people, I direct that to Ryan. I text/chat/skype/snapchat/whatever him, and I'm happy just to talk to him from far away. And I'm always happy when he does the same. 

My reasoning is that: if Ryan is just upping my standards for potential dates, while giving me a safe and comfortable sexual outlet with someone I care and trust, it's OK. I'm keeping my options open for that someone that might give me everything I need.

And I don't know if that's unrealistic. 

He called me today after his final exam. He is officially graduated and coming back to his hometown, where now I am living. I can't help to feel inferior and unworthy of being with someone like him. Although we both went to a very good school in CA, he's the one that graduated with all kinds of honors, active in student government, went on to a top-tier grad school, and now is about to start a Director-level position at a VERY large company (known all over the world) in August. Whereas here I am, first yeah after graduation, with a GPA that wouldn't get me into any decent grad school, unemployed after I quit a sales job I hated, no employment prospects that could have anything to do with my science degree, and getting a little too excited for a couple of tutoring gigs I've gotten this week. 

It hurts me that he's never seriously asked me to visit him at school. He's said things like ""get over here now"" and things like that, but never actual plans with dates or details. And while I moved away from his hometown for that sales job, he did see me when he would fly over for interviews to this new city, it was never just to see me. Although I did come visit him (I asked him if I could visit) in NY for his summer internship. I don't feel like he's made an equivalent gesture: the flying out to see me.

Now that he's graduated, I found out today he will be traveling around the world with his business school friends and his brother. He had all summer, no school to worry about, and we haven't seen each other since January, and he didn't even bother to schedule a trip to LA to see me. That, to me, says a lot of how much he misses me/wants to see me. His parents still support him, he's made tens of thousands in between undergrad and grad school. I am unemployed, and my parents don't support me financially anymore. He is the one with access to make our meeting happen. 

I also don't feel worthy of mentioning how his actions make me feel right now because he's post-finals but before his graduation ceremony. I don't want him to be thinking about how he failed while he should be the happiest about his achievement, and looking forward to his big trip.

I will also admit I'm scared he will sleep with someone on that summer-long trip. I don't see why he, as a single guy backpacking throughout the world, drinking and partying, would not. I have no reason to believe he's slept with someone else yet, but if he did, it would be very hard for me to find out anyways.

Rationally, I would do that same things he's doing. I put myself in his shoes and I hate what I think of myself. I would be embarrassed to bring someone like me to meet his friends at a school like his. I would feel like I'm lowering my standards, so I'd keep someone like her around for the fun, no strings-attached sex. But I'd also be a nice-enough guy to let her know that that's all I want, and I don't want her holding back because of me.

Am I holding myself back from finding a fulfilling relationship? Why can't I appreciate what I do have instead of wondering what might be? 
I want to be able to tell him how I feel ( that I do like him, I want to be with him, and that I feel inadequate next to him) and be able to handle rejection and end the ""relationship"" with Ryan 100%. I don't know if this imbalance of power is just one of the reasons we're not a good fit, and it would just be best for both of us to find someone else. But I am so happy just hearing from him, and the days when we ARE together, these worries just fade away. Do they really fade away? Or am I just captured in the reuniting bliss, but we're never together long enough to fade and for the real issues to arise? Am I just projecting the my insecurities on to someone, or am I actually harming myself by staying in this ""relationship/situation""? Will it seem like I was indeed waiting for him if, once we both live in the same city, I spill my feelings for him in a ""now we can be together"" kind of show?

These past five months became unbearable to the point where I was driven to depression. 

Without going deep into the specific contents of my OCD, (mainly checking and ""pure O"" type stuff) it all got to the point to where I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed in the mornings, and I had severe insomnia at night. Since I've sought help and been diagnosed with OCD, I've been better able to cope and actually live my life better, but it's definitely still a work in progress. Like everyone, I have my good days, bad days, and horrible-awful-unbearable days.

Anyways, I had to discontinue therapy (it was through student counseling services) because I'm going home for the summer, then traveling a lot for an internship. I'll be in the same place for about 6 weeks in between moving around to other areas. Is it worth it to look into therapy in the city I'll be in this summer? How much can I get accomplished in 6 weeks? Or should I just wait to continue therapy in the fall? Both my psychologist and psychiatrist didn't seem to think it was necessary for me to find someone over the summer, but if it can keep the ball rolling in recovery, I'd like to.

I'm starting Zoloft tomorrow, and I'm really really really hoping it takes the edge off of my racing thoughts and will help lift this depression. Especially because the job I have will likely be stressful and may trigger a lot of my symptoms. Any good stories about Zoloft to give me hope?

TL;DR
Can I get much out of therapy if I can only see someone for six weeks?
Any good stories about how Zoloft/other SSRI's helped you or someone you know?"

I've been on keto for about 3.5 weeks, I've lose 10 pounds (not counting water weight since I didn't weigh myself until day 4).  I haven't asked any questions yet since I feel like the same thing gets asked over and over, but I have a few I haven't seen pop up yet (I think).

1) I used to sleep around 7 hours a night, but now I'm sleeping 7 hours a night and taking like a 2 hour nap every day.  Does this eventually go away?

2) When did you tell your friends/family you were switching diets?  I've told my 3 closest friends, but no one else.  When we go out I'm pretty subtle about my choices and just kinda let it go.  I haven't told my family (I live at college) because my mom has been wanting me to lose weight for awhile (buying low fat foods, stressing ""everything in moderation"", etc).  I don't think she would approve of low carb, so I only want to tell them after I've succeeded more.

3) How do you fight the mental side?  When I make breakfast in the morning, fat(ter) me would want like 3-4 scrambled eggs plus toast.  Now I get full probably on 2 eggs and a few sausage links, but when I'm preparing food I have a bad memory of that and feel tempted to make my meals as big as I used to.  My internship starts next week so I've been sitting at home working out/watching tutorials on random web development stuff, so I feel the need to eat when I get bored.  I've been holding off, but do these urges go away?

4) Thank you all for all the motivating posts and delicious recipes!"

I got through the first and second interview, extremely well and getting lots of compliments, of a paid internship that I was well overqualified for...(not even a fucking *job*). I signed a lease for a place in the area so once I got it, I would already be set up and ready to start. Its with a nice townhouse a couple roommates which should be fun.

So now I'm stuck here searching for minimum wage jobs like restaurant and grocery store jobs.

**My significant other's truck requires $4000 in repairs.**

He took it in to get a check up, just to make sure everything is running smoothly. Turns out there are stage 3 leaks on a head gasket, oil pan, and all sorts of other shitty things. The mechanic strongly advised us to sell off the truck rather than paying to try and fix it.

**I may have just lost one of my closest friends.**

We got in a fight because she heard some untrue or bias things about me. She didn't bother asking for my side of the story and threw heated accusations at me. I tried twice to meet with her to talk it out in person. I apologized to her for getting a little angry myself because I was amazed you wouldn't ask for my side of the story before making judgments. I wanted to fix our friendship because we hadn't talked in two weeks after the fight. You ignored each of my attempts and began being directly and publicly shaming me for the smallest errors I would make.

Well I told you I didn't want to be friends anymore and that I was done pouring myself out to you.  Now I have asked for my concert ticket...for the two day musical festival that you, me, and a few mutual friends are going to. Now what the fuck am I supposed to do if we aren't friends anymore? Where am I supposed to camp? How are we supposed to hang out with our mutual friends? Will they even like me after you tell them we are friends anymore? Will I run out of friends? Maybe I should be alone forever.

**I'm getting fat again**

fuck man, I just need to get back into the gym and stop eating like a little piggie. *Oh one cookie won't hurt...well I'll just have pizza for dinner tonight but then tomorrow I'll have yogurt!...I lied, I have more pizza...Mmmburritos are healthy right?*

**Another typical problem: I'm running out of money**

I need to get my shit together and stop spending so much money on eating out and shopping and **shit shit shit shit shit.**

**Fuck this week.**

I am troubled with the current state of affairs with regards to companies unfairly treating young Canadians by making them to a job for free under the idea that it is an internship that gives you experience; such an 'internship' is a gray area in the law that needs to be clarified, (here's a [link](http://lawofwork.ca/?p=2169) wrestling with the legality of it, specifically in Ontario). For many young Canadians, we can't afford to work for free, and such internships should be paid job. We need a government that cares about its youth, because they are the people will inherit this country; we need the government to pass a law forcing big businesses to pay their interns who are doing a job that would otherwise be paid one.

Here is a few Ministers contact information for you to send an email. [Minister of Justice] (http://www.conservative.ca/?cr=niagara-falls), [Minister of Labour](http://www.conservative.ca/?cr=halton), [Minister of Finance](http://www.conservative.ca/?cr=whitby-oshawa)

So my question is, what can I do with my experience? I feel stuck because most of my experience is in retail; I don't want to pursue retail or sales anymore at the store level.

Last year of college, I'm studying abroad to have a great experience. Things are fun enough, meet a spectacular girl while I'm there. We get pretty close, but our relationship was forming at the end of my trip and ended all too abruptly. I'm upset over this, but that's just how life goes. I've always had plans to go back, but I had to finish college, and after graduating it's been just **so** hard to nail down a job and get a stable career going, I feel like I've been bouncing around cities and different opportunities and job interviews seemingly forever. I'm frankly just tired of it all and it's a wonder to me how everyone else gets along.

Presently, I'm working at an OK company. I started off as an unpaid intern (hurray employer's market) and I got bumped up to extremely low pay a little while ago. I'm working here in order to finally get paid normal human wages, especially for the amount of work I put in (and the responsibility I take on, AND the hours I put in), but after talking to a few people I realize real pay is a long ways away. Now I'm back to looking for jobs *again*, the same depressing grind that's killing my general view on life.

Now for the part that actually really gets me down. A friend of mine managed to get cheap tickets to the country I studied abroad in! I can get the tickets EXTREMELY cheap (literally &gt;$1,000 cheaper) and they can potentially provide housing. Their trip is scheduled for June 8th and I'm invited. Sweet. However, even with airfare and potential lodging covered, I still don't have enough to cover even the basics for a few stinking days.

It's killing me. It's been 2 years since I've been there and am really looking forward to it, but every force on Earth seems to be preventing me from going. I don't do anything for fun, I just work for shit wages and pay my rent. My time now is just spent studying about my field and looking for new jobs.

If anyone reads this, just thanks for reading. And if beyond that anyone needs more details I can provide them, I just wanted to bitch and whine somewhere."

I called and her mom answered, took down my name, number and was skeptical on how I knew how to speak Korean (I'm Filipino and studied abroad in Seoul). Then she called her daughter.

Specifically, he mentioned for me to learn how to navigate file systems using the scripting language as well as discovering what some of the config files in /etc are. 

As for my skills currently, I am an intermediate programmer. I developed a stong logical foundation through BASIC and I am quite comfortable with Java and C. I also know a bit of CSS and HTML, at least enough to make an amateur looking website simply with code. 

What I would be doing in my internship would be helping with administrative processes.  Mainly checking on the server and processor stacks in their computer rooms. He also mentioned working with servers, however, I am not sure if that has any correlation with bash.

I just have no idea where to start and any help would be greatly appreciated. "

I plan to live at home for two more years, to finish college in one and then hammer out my debt completely in the other. 
I have a very reliable car, with a mechanic in the family who really cuts down on that cost.
My parents also will loan me money if I need it, interest free, so having an emergency fund isn't so important to me. I'm just wondering what you guys think about my plan for my income this summer.

**Take home pay:**

Internship paying $12/hr = ~$360 after tax.

**Debts:**

13k Stafford Unsubsidized @ 6.8%

5.5k Stafford Unsubsidized @ 6.8% to be borrowed this fall for my final year. 

No credit cards or car payments or anything else. No rent either.

**Savings:**

none. I have just enough to buy food and gas until I get my first (weekly) paycheck.

I plan on putting at least $1,200 against my student loans in the three months, with the same amount going into my savings. The rest (~160$/week) will be left for my expenses.

Do you think I should double up on the loans and skip saving for now? because if I save now, I can pay back some of my new loan immediately in the fall; or I can pay off my current loans now, then take the new one out later when I need to pay tuition.

I hope this isn't too confusing, I'm not entirely sure what option is best."

Help?",Fatalfable,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1e3eg3/i_just_finished_finals_its_been_over_nine_months/,"Thanks for helping me out guys. I am going to give a lot of background. I want you guys to know my history and where I am coming from as it might help. If you could care less about my past just skip to the ""Now"" Section.

 Here are the 3 phases:

**Phase 1**

I'm sure like many of you out there, we were bullied. This was the catalyst to my life in exercise and fitness. I learned everything on my own (well, the internet). I started out in 9th grade as 5'5 and 190lbs. I never really improved my diet at first, I just started exercising. I lost my first 30 with Dance Dance Revolution. I reached a plateau and learned about dieting. I also picked up the gym. Some food choices and terrible form later I dropped another 15 lbs. I plateau'd until the end of junior year of highschool. Me and my friends picked up longboarding and thats all we would do. I mainly lost it due to malnutrition of skating the streets of NYC all day and only eating a slice of pizza and an arizona. Right before I left for a summer music program I was about 135lbs and 5'7. I also had a starvation period during this time where I was deliberately trying to become anorexic running 5 or 6 miles a day and trying not to eat for 2 days followed by a binge eat. 

During the summer program I gained about 18 lbs (Regardless of maintaining my weight lifting at the local gym). I started thinking I was gaining muscle and kept on eating more and putting on more lbs. By December of that year I had bumped back to the 160s. 

**Phase 2**:

I freaked out, went hard on my research and tried changing all of my food choices again. I started eating egg whites, sweet potato, chickens, salmons, cutting out some junk food. My portions weren't the greatest and I still wasn't counting calories well. I started running to school and back home and lost about 15 lbs by the summertime (I still maintained gym workouts).  I tried picking up insanity but I could never stick it out. 

Towards the end of the summer I had dropped to 148 and met up with a polish bodybuilder. This is where everything changed. He taught me about how to correctly count calories, manage my macro nutrients, change food choices, and introduced me to the world of park workouts. I started learning slowly and we exchanged emails for a while. My real turning point with diet was when I asked him if I could have honey in my oatmeal and he said ""Stop being a little bitch and only eat what you need. Do you need honey?"". In my first week of eating 6 times a day, managing everything, doing my park muscle workouts followed by an hour of low intensity power walking, and skating all week long, I lost about 8 lbs in that one week after plateauing for months. I lost 2 lbs each week for the three weeks following and stopped there. 

I continued running, doing sessions of insanity here and there as college started but it was a struggle to maintain. During the month I had between fall and spring semesters I started insanity. I ate 6 times a day. My entire diet consisted of chicken, sweet potato, peanut butter, whole wheat/grain bread, greek yogurt, kashi cereal, fruits, and brown rice. That's it. I was extremely determined and nothing was going to stop me. I was sleeping only three hours a night because of school work, and often work still do my workout day If I pulled an all nighter. I almost finished the program but with two weeks left I got very very sick with the flu for 2 weeks and completely through me off my game. I vowed to myself after this I wouldn't go back to a gym. I loved it and gained about 6 lbs while losing fat. I simply maintained until the end of the semester. 

**Phase 3** :

By May (of 2012 at this point) I started working out at the park again. I was beginning to fulfill a long time fitness dream of doing a full perfect form wide arm pull-up. My workout plan was a two day split of pyramid workouts. 

Day 1:
pullupx1, Pushupx10, pullupx2, pullupx10 etc. to 5 reps then back down.

Up until I could do full pullups I would jump up, hold 10 seconds, and slowly come down. That would be 1 rep. 

Run for 30-50 minutes. Towards the end of workout find hill and sprint up max speed and walk back down 6 times. 

Day 2: 

Same pyramid idea with dips &amp; whatever this is (http://www.bodyrock.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ReversePushUp11.jpg) which worked on my biceps and back.

I also did 50 squats each leg x2

Same cardio.

1 day rest and repeat.(Sometimes no rest. I'll keep looping these two days)

Diet was the same as during insanity time and usually had my calories at around 2000-2300 a day. 

I had significant gains in muscle. By August I was in love with my new found strength and was like a monkey. Anything I could hang off of I would do so and if I could I would do pull ups. I was able to do 6 slow and controlled pullups by doing this workout.

The first week of August I had to fill in at my friend's job for the following 5 weeks. There, I worked 3 days a week for 36 hours. 3 to 3 as a barback. This was a really tough job that required a lot of heavy lifting, and running around the building. You also got no chance to eat except for the customers left overs when cleaning up their bar food in the kitchen. By the time you got home you were usually too tired to even eat. 

At the end of those five weeks I dropped 15 lbs from muscle loss, fat loss, and from being malnourished. 

School starts a few days later and it soon gets rough. I can't do schoolwork at home so I decide to solve my procrastination issues by sleeping at 6 or 7 pm and getting up at two in the morning. Get to school at 3am'ish and stay there until 5:30pm when I would drive home. No exercise was done and diet was thrown away as there are no local options. Winter break I began drinking a significant amount of alcohol. I got depressed. School started again and the shenanigans continued. While I wasnt getting there at 3am anymore I was still in school for 12 hours a day and later on in the week I had to put in internship hours plus homework. I began drinking basically every weekend to the point where I drank 500-750ml each time I drank. Some weekends going to 2 liters.

Did I also mention that my diet for this time has been mcdonalds, burritos, and pizza? (In my school this is all I have available)

**Now**: 

Now, half way through college, 25lbs heavier, deciding to quit drinking all together before it becomes a problem, I am happy, motivated and ready to get started.

Info:

Age:19

Height: 5'7/5'8 

Weight:160

How often do I exercise?: 0 days a week

Diet:Terrible compared to my old standards. I took out the terrible things but It still isn't a ""bodybuilder diet"". I am completely comfortable drastically changing my diet as long as I have a plan. (How many calories per meal, what are in these meals, when to eat these meals and why) 


**What I want**: 

Lose these 25lbs of fat I gained. Have muscle strength gains. I don't want to say I can bench press 300lbs. I want to say, ""I can do a hand stand, I can do 20 pullups, I can do 100 pushups, I have a 6 pack"". 

Goals for summer:

I. Drop 20-25 lbs of fat

II. Reach 10 Wide arm, slow and controlled Pullups

III. 70 push ups straight

IV.  7 minute mile runs for a 10k



**What I want from /r/Fitness**: 

I. Help me establish a workout plan that targets the major muscle groups of my body that can be done at a park? 

II. Help me establish a diet that will supplement my workouts and allow my to lose fat in a quick and healthy fashion. 

III. Help me figure out how to maintain some of my fitness level and at least not gain any weight when I go back to school. I'm absolutely sick of losing weight and building my fitness level over and over again. 



**Considerations &amp; Kidney issues**:

I had cancer as a child and had a kidney removed as well as parts of several other organs. Ever since my creatinine NOT creatine levels have been very high. This is can be worsened via large amounts of protein. I am recommended not to push it more than 70 grams a day. If my levels go to high, my kidney can become so overworked, it will fail and I will need dialysis. If I can keep it under 70 that would be great.

My park has monkey bars, pullup bar, and longbars for dips. There is also a pole attached to this area that can be used simply for climbing.



Thank you so much if you have gotten this far. It really means so much to me if you can help out. I'm a classical guitarist and music therapist in training, if I can somehow repay using my skills I would be more than glad.

1e3cmo,4,2013-05-10,Finally employed in my first professional job and it was because of networking,razorblade2099,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1e3cmo/finally_employed_in_my_first_professional_job_and/,"A lot of this is copy and paste from a post I made in a forum, but it's finally happened. I finally found professional work in the industry, company, and city I want to be in.

I'm a recent graduate in accounting/finance. I left university without coop or internship experience so I've been struggling to find entry level work for a while. I started my CMA training anyways so it would show employers that I have the raw talent for accounting and analysis. I've been passed over a few times for more experienced candidates despite making good impressions on the interviewers. One time it was for an internship position. Imagine that, experienced accounting personnel are applying for paid internships. Mind you it was at a internationally recognized company but still.

I met this senior manager at a volunteer event/function over the weekend. He was impressed by the level of hard work I had shown during this event and had agreed to meet me for coffee. Before meeting him for coffee, I did my research on his educational and career background. I asked him about why he decided to obtain two accounting designations. I asked him about about how he was finding his transition to his new role. Then I asked him what it was about the industry he worked in that fascinated him. 

After this, we began to talk about the industry and the company. I had specific questions prepared that I asked in order to help me better understand the industry and then I asked further probing questions when he answered. We talked about the future of the commodity that the company dealt with, as well as the world wide issues surrounding it. I was able to relate specifically to facts that the MD&amp;A/annual report and CEO have touched upon in news interviews. During all of this time, I had a note book out that I used to take notes on anything that he said that I did not already know. 

We then began to talk about myself and my own experience. The type of character I display and the positive attitude I had. I asked if he could refer me to the controller for an interview for a AP Admin role that the company had posted, and indicated that I knew it would still be my own responsibility to earn the job and convince the controller that I was the right fit. He asked me if this is what I really wanted to do, and I explained that in all honesty it wasn't, but it was a way for me to get my foot in the door. It was at this point where he offered to look into creating a FA job for me at the company. 

Now ask yourself this, would he have even considered this if I had not been prepared for this meeting? If I had not shown the initiative to do the research and to reach out to meet him directly? If I had emailed him my application, he may have forwarded it to the controller, or more likely forwarded it to HR, where I'd get a courtesy interview but I'd probably be dismissed because of my inexperience.

This morning I received the job offer. He called me back to the office and explained that although he wanted to create the FA job for me because we both agreed that was where my talents indicated where I should be, he couldn't because the yearly budget had been made and he couldn't justify adding to the head count at this time. Instead he gave me the AP Admin job. Assuming I perform well, we agreed to revisit the possibility of creating the FA job for me next year. 

For all of you looking for work who are in the same boat as I was, I must stress the importance of networking. Over half the interviews I have received have only been because I network. But networking is not something you only do when you're looking for work. It's about building something for yourself and others. And in the end, networking isn't going to get you the job. You still have to earn this. It will however get you the interview and a chance to earn it."

[20m],expandmyhorizons,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1e3cke/very_stressed_girlfriend_20f_just_got_a_speeding/,"Long story short, she has been working two jobs and an internship, basically having school and work from 7-5 and then having to do school work the rest of the night every day.  We've been together almost 2 1/2 years, but I've never gotten a speeding ticket.  She is very strapped for money, and I will definitely pay for it if she wants, and I might even insist.  She also has to go to traffic school so that her insurance doesn't go up, and it will be extremely difficult for her to find time to do that, even on the weekends.  

Any ideas on how to comfort her and let her know it's okay? I've been struggling and getting frustrated at both her and myself because I never know what to say or do when she's having trouble. Last weekend she visited me at my university (we go to different universities and visit each other every weekend) and forgot a book for her midterm and extra underwear, and I swear she almost started throwing up from how hard she was crying and it took an hour before she calmed down. I have no idea how to comfort her.

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.

It's going to primarily be for gaming. It's a present for a friend who has been using an old laptop that I gave him two years ago (which was only ever midrange, and was 2 years old when I gave it to him). 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$500

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I plan on doing the build over the summer, since I got a sweet internship that's paying well. I understand that the prices will fluctuate, but I want to get a good idea of what to look for.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?

We can make do without most of the accessories since he has some from his even more ancient pcs, but I'd like to include a monitor that isn't a shitty crt.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I will be purchasing in Austin, TX and to be perfectly honest I have no idea as I don't currently live there.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Like I said, he has a keyboard and mouse. They're really shitty, but they'll do.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?

Doubtful. Maybe way down the line, but somehow I doubt the form factor will allow for much

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

I want it to be small and durable, so that he can move it around. So mATX probably

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?

Yes, I am absolutely swimming in legit Windows licenses, and worst-case scenario the license on his current laptop will transfer. I have both 32 and 64 bit licenses.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

I really don't know anything about AMD (I'm more of an Intel+Nvidia guy), and I have a strong feeling that that's the way this build is going to have to go. However I would like to note that I want this PC to last as long as possible since I doubt he will have the money to upgrade.

Finally, as prices are bound to fluctuate, I'm fine with the build going a bit over budget."

1) I had the interview with their VP of Engineering but her questions weren't *very* technical (i.e. explain polymorphism or how did you implement ORM last time, etc). The lead that interviewed me right after, asked some more in-depth questions of some of my previous projects but nothing really hard (write a function to do this, then do a complexity analysis), followed by another senior executive whose questions were around my travelling, previous work experience but nothing really in-depth. 
2) the pay is kinda low: ~6.6 GBP/hour (before tax!) in London which will mostly go to renting a reasonable studio around. They *do* offer breakfast and lunch so I would only have to experiment with cooking during the week-end. But even with this I'm not sure how much of savings I can do if any. The question to ask: experience (long-term perspective) vs. money (short-term savings to be used for the uni from the Autumn)

I'm thinking of negotiating now a little bit, but find this kinda awkward since I didn't comment when I was first told during the interview. 

Any advice or perspective would be appreciated :)"

   By bad habits I mean, ADHD has caused so much stress that I no longer am able to look at things that mAy be negative. I don't check my grades during the school year, I avoid reading emails since it may regard to my school loans or academic probation and I just don't see how I can fully function in this world when I am like this. 

   I have to intern twice in addition to my 8 classes and I can't get past it. In fact, I really wanted to take 3 classes this summer but have yet to sign up in regards that I may have another hold or another setback. Ie developed a ""wait to the literal last minute and pray"" method and sometimes it works out but sometimes it doesn't. The further I get into my profession, the more likely this method will not work at all. 

TL;DR: Unattended ADHD has caused problems, built the habit of avoidance if a negative outcome/emails is an option. How can I get myself to break the habit?

1e37mv,37,2013-05-10,"I'm going to be a college senior, and I'm afraid. No desire to do/interest in public accounting. No idea what else to do.",thedogisinthelog,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1e37mv/im_going_to_be_a_college_senior_and_im_afraid_no/,"Just looking for some advice, I guess. I know there's plenty of options outside of public, but for the past few years, my career path has been a straight line: go to school, go to graduate school, public internship at some point, pass CPA, be CPA. 


Well, I don't want to work in public accounting. I was going towards that path because that's just what every accounting program will naturally push its students to do. Networking events are with public firms. Accounting career fairs are with public firms. Beta Alpha Psi meetings are trips to public firms or a speaker from a public firm speaking about public accounting. Everything I've learned about public from these things, the stress, the hours, the workload, the type of work...the everything, just makes me say, why the hell am I going to do this to myself? I have pretty horrible social anxiety and I swing in and out of major depression, both which I'm working on, but going into public accounting seems like something that'd easily break me in the first few months. I just don't think I can handle it at all. Big 4 would be suicide, I know a few people working for medium-sized firms and that seems almost as bad...I dunno, public just sounds like bad news for me.



The problem is, I just don't know what to do, or how to do it. I don't know what kind of accounting jobs I can get. I do like accounting, for what it's worth. It's fun and challenging and I have a 4.0GPA within my major (and a 3.95 outside of it). I really loved cost accounting and I loved both intermediate accounting classes (somehow). I mean, strangely enough, I like journal entries. Preparing statements. Balances and ledgers. I like different inventory costing methods and budgets and their variances and work-in-process inventory and spoilage and other cost-accounting things I can't remember. I certainly liked doing those things a lot more than what audit and tax taught me (though tax was pretty fun, too). Professor anecdotes that begin with, ""When I was working at Dow chemical..."" interest me a lot more than, ""When I was working at Deloitte..."" But who are the people who do that in the company? My mind gets stuck on ""bookkeeper"" or ""clerk"" and then my mind gets stuck on ""$10/hour part-time summer job with no room to advance"" and ""good luck living on $10 an hour, I'm sure it'll be totally doable and will lead to the low-stress life you're looking for"" 


I dunno. Maybe it's just the public bias I've been taught by this subreddit and my school. Maybe I'm overthinking this, and getting an accounting job at some manufacturing corporation that'd allow me to live, not extravagantly but at least securely, is more reasonable than I think. It's just...how? Where? For what position? I've been taught online applications are black holes for public accounting firms and the only way to get a job is career fairs, but what if it's not a public accounting firm? I guess I should head to the ""general"" career fair rather than the accounting one and hand out some resumes and try to speak to people and hope for the best? 


I guess at this point I'm just kind of ranting and rambling...so I'll end it here. **tl;dr: no public, what do?**


**Edit:** Thanks, everyone. I know accounting a huge field, and public isn't the ""be all end all"" of accounting as someone put it, but after 3 years at school and browsing this subreddit on occasion it's hard to see other opportunity. But I'm feeling a lot better about everything now, so, thanks again! "

I'm thinking there could be some sort of tech hack that users on /r/frugal use in order to get their tv fix. 

Of course, my other option is just to grab the free locals and Netflix or torrent, which is fine. I figured this could be worth a shot and others may be in my same position. Thanks guys"

So /u/Emburii posted [a job opening](http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1e2xwd/seeking_quality_analysts_with_web_and_leadership/) for... well, you can see for yourself what it was. But thanks to it being deleted, it's probably gonna fade into the void without being seen the way it should be.

See, *this* is the shit that unpaid internships lead to. 4 years experience in web development and leadership positions gets paid at $13/hr. This race to the bottom nonsense has to stop.

We're looking for people to do some bug testing onsite for a rather large company in Burnaby.  We need people with one to four years of professional experience or paid results in making webpages, and some leadership experience (even informally).  The pay would be $13/hr.  They are looking for longer-term folks, so if your schedule fills up with classes in a few months then this probably won't be a good fit.  Post here, or PM, or email me at ecarroll@volt.com.

I'm an accounting student in Israel and I recently took a SAP Business One class so I'm pretty familiar with most of the ""end user"" functions. I work in a small company where we just implemented SBO. I was very involved in the process as I was sent to that class by my employer, and as time passes I get more and more experience working with SBO.

I've already landed the required internship to get my CPA license at one of the Big 4 offices in an IT auditing department - they were very happy to have an intern with some basic SBO knowledge.

My question, with regards to most posts here being relevant to R3 (or so it seems) is whether it would be a good idea to find a class or some other kind of training for ""the big SAP"" - R3.

I have zero experience / knowledge in that area and I thought it might be a good idea to familiarize myself with the system.

Any input? Thanks in advance."

He is out studying at a cafe and i have to clean the room before he gets back because im terrified that he will be so mad at me if i dont do it. I'm so scared he is really angry with me and is going to come home and break up with me. We had a fight last night and all morning i've felt angry and sad and confused, even though he doesnt ever do anything wrong. I feel like he is jsut staying with me becuase the economy is really bad in italy right now and he wants to find a job here and he doesnt really like me at all/ wants a free place to live in america. I'm convinced once he goes back to italy he will never talk to me again.

 i quit my really amazing internship last night becuase i'm so angry and sad and frustrated all the time. I just dont see the point. i want to move and go somewhere else. i feel so numb and scared and confused and i dont think i can leave my house. But he and I are supposed to go to a museum in a few hours and I was in a terrible mood yesterday and i dont want him to think i'm such a needy bitch everrrydaayyy. (harsh on myself i know but thats how i feel)

He and I keep fighting every night, he says I am happy and cheery and then all of the sudden i just snap and get mad at him for osmething that doesnt make sense, but it ALWAYS makes sense to me. how do i calm down, i'm totally freaking out. I feel like im ruining his time in america becuase i cry all the time and cant stay in control of myself. I'm trying to listen to really happy music but i still feel so shitty.

 He is going to be back soon and im so scared hes going to break up with me and leave me. I'm in such a bad mood and i need to pick myself up fast so that he doesnt. 

I cant control myself or my emotions and he gets really frustrated with me, and i just hate myself after being a bitch to him becuase hes so perfect. how do i control this and keep myself from being a total bitch to him?? when i look at our converstaions in retrospect.. he probably wasnt doing or saying anything wrong but the things he does or says really hurt me in the moment. 
ughhhhh lifeeeee

(also havnt formally been diagnosed, buut the past 6 months everything on this subreddit has sounded like my voice, and therapist i saw hinted that i have it but wasnt going to continue seeing me and she referred me to someone else soo sort of just in the process of figuring this out.. so sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit area just felt comfortable posting here)"

NEED ADVISE!,[deleted],Visa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Visa/comments/1e2xav/visitor_visa_turned_to_work_visa_need_advise/,"Hey guys, Please help me out with a dilemma, if possible.  I'm an Italian citizen and will be graduating from my university next month.  My original plan was to spend the summer in NYC with my boyfriend. I originally applied for an internship, thinking that if accepted, I'd go through with their visa, but I received their rejection notice a few weeks ago.  In light of that, I've decided to go through with the visa waiver program (pay the US 14 euros for application), since an actual tourist visa is not required for Italian citizens for stays up to 90 days.  Plane tickets have already been purchased for mid June through mid September.  However, luck has it that the internship emailed and called today confirming that they've accepted me into the program, despite the previous news.  Dates are not set in stone yet, but they mentioned that it'll start mid July through October.  They will provide a work or internship visa for me, but my question is, since my most recent plan was to go without a visa and plane tickets were already bought, what are my best options?
 
Best case scenario: I can forgo the visa waiver program which clearly states that I cannot change my visa status during my stay as a tourist.  I'll have the work visa in-hand instead when entering the US in June and will tell the entrance guard that my internship starts in a month and that I'm just here early as a visitor.
 
If that's not acceptable, another possibility is for me to leave for NYC mid June as planned, then somehow re-enter the country (via Canada) to ""activate"" the work visa in July when it starts?
 
The most unfavorable scenario is if I have to fly back to Italy, then fly again back to NYC when the date of the visa and internship program starts.  Is this necessary or is re-entering the country through, say, Canada OK?
 
Thanks in advance!"

(m/22),[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e2u54/f22i_was_supposed_to_marry_this_guy_now_its/,"I’m having trouble understanding my ex boyfriend. It’s been really hard on me lately and I just don’t know what to do and I’m so confused all the time. To start at the beginning… we started dating when we were 16 and continued dating till we were 20. At that time I was living with him, we broke up because I got confused about having feelings towards someone else and I didn’t want it to cause problems. I tried to stop talking to this guy but it didn’t work. So I eventually moved out. A month after I moved out and we were trying to be friends, he told me he couldn’t talk to me anymore because he loved me. I didn’t know what to do about this because I was afraid it was just because he was alone. We stopped talking for about 4 months, until I saw him walking on our college campus. We ended up seeing each other a few days later and we ended up having sex on and off for about 4 months until he moved away for a summer internship. After 3 months, he came back and we ended up having sex two more times. Then I broke down and said I still loved him and it was killing me to just be friends with benefits. So I told him that I couldn’t talk to him or see him anymore about 7 months later I ran into him on campus, and he invited me over for dinner, I declined saying I wasn’t ready. I then later texted him that I was sorry for being kind of cold towards him and that I would like to have dinner soon. I eventually had dinner with him and it was nice catching up and everything. We started texting about twice every week after that. He’s graduating from college now and is moving away for work. He had been saying that he wanted to hang out some before he left. I hung out with him last night. But before I tell you about that let me tell you some of the things he said to me. One night his apartment got broken into, the one we used to share, and he said that he wished I was there. A while after that he told me that he has dreams about me almost every night. Sometimes nightmares, sometimes sex and stuff, also commenting on how awesome of a girl I am and how he thinks I’m beautiful. So now onto last night, we went out to dinner and we were having great conversation. Several times he refers to it as a date… and he paid for the meal. When we walked out he put his arm around me and when we got in the car, he started to hold my hand and said he just wanted to see if it still felt the same. He then asked if I want to come to his place and drink of few beers… I said yes ( like an idiot) and we drank a few then he started to kiss my cheek and well it escalated. I stayed there and he woke up and kissed me… and when he took me home he said he’d like to see me again before he left and then kissed me goodbye. I just don’t know what happened to be honest… he says he doesn't love me and I believe him, I just don’t understand his actions. Please if anyone could just help me understand…I’d appreciate it. Thanks."

1e2i3e,36,2013-05-10,[Update] I posted over a year ago about a roommate calling the cops on me without saying anything to me. I just want to bring some encouragement to others arrested that you'll get past it.,bobEddins,entwives,https://www.reddit.com/r/entwives/comments/1e2i3e/update_i_posted_over_a_year_ago_about_a_roommate/,"[Here is the link to the old post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/entwives/comments/pg3fg/smoke_one_for_me_first_time_arrested_never/)

Hey ladies! I just want to offer some encouragement to the ones who have been arrested. 

TL;DR of old post: Got ""roommate matched"" in a college town (not on campus living) and smoked for the first time in the apartment out of a one hitter about a month or so after moving in. Stupidly thought a few hits wouldn't smell too strong. No one was home, and I wanted to play Skyrim. Late that night one roommate called the cops without saying anything to me. I was half asleep and a good cop/bad cop was pulled on me and I admitted it to the nice cop. I didn't have a lot so it was just a misdemeanor. 

So that was over a year ago, and I'm so glad that besides taking almost 2000 bucks out of my pocket and a finished 6 months probation, it hasn't affected my life. I'm an engineering student so at the time I had just worked the first semester of my engineering co-op job. I was super nervous about the court date and ended up getting 6 months probation, and after I finished the conviction would be dropped so only an arrest would show up. After the court date I was super nervous about my boss finding out and getting fired. They had already told me they wanted to hire me after I graduated, and I knew they'd do another background check then. I got the courage during the summer when I went back to work, and I asked a chill co-worker if I should tell my boss. My boss had already said that he used to smoke so I felt pretty comfortable about it. He said it'd be fine and just to not mess up again. So I feel much better but I don't really enjoy the type of work I'm doing at the job but at the least I had it as an option. 

I went to a meet and greet at my college before the summer and talked to a guy that worked for a big government contractor and says that his team programs defense missile targets. Fast forward to now, and I start the internship in a few weeks. I'm so excited! I had to get a clearance for it and I put down the arrest and all, and I got it! The language is C++ which I enjoy way more than what I'm doing at my current job. Plus having a big company on my resume will definitely help future jobs to not care as much about the arrest. 

I might lose a job offer or more in the future but that's fine. It's in the past, and there is nothing I can change about it. 

I just wanted you ladies that get super nervous like me to know that it's not the end of the world. You will get through it. Also, remember that not everyone in the college age group is comfortable enough to say ""Hey, don't smoke in the apartment. I will call the cops if you do it again.""

So I wasn't going to post this, but this morning I saw the roommate that called the cops on the frontpage from a r/gonewild post. She's posted many times and that really bums me out. I never got revenge like my friends wanted me to, and I still don't plan to because my life is good. I don't want to give her the satisfaction the she fucked it up and then view all of us as ""bad people"" since I got revenge. I just don't understand how you can post naked pictures of yourself (not that it's a bad thing) and then call the cops on someone for an equally harmless thing. 


TL;DR: Finished my 6 months probation and got the conviction dropped with only an arrest on my record. Got an awesome engineering internship with a big government contractor. Had to get a clearance and even with putting down the arrest I received the clearance. Saw the girl that called the cops on r/gonewild.

I'm 18, and in college. Currently in NYC for an internship this summer. I'm okay when it comes to game in college, it's *way* easier than when you don't know anyone.

So I'm in NY, and I don't know anyone. Literally not a single person, which kicks ass because I'm forced to be social.

Started an under-21 GothamSeddit groupme, and went out with some of the guys from there last night.

**FR:**

I knew I had to approach, and kick this AA but it wasn't until last night that I finally approached. We went to an NYU bar that doesn't ID, and the guy I was with was killing it. He was mad social, ridiculously good at talking to girls, and I was like standing there thinking I don't know anyone.

So I opened a set of two girls - they weren't that cute but I really just needed to get out of my head. Turns out they were both PhD students, and they had some pretty cool stories to tell. I felt like it really ended up being interview-ish, and that made it kind of awkward. Still, I think I held conversation with them pretty well, but exiting the set was a little hard. I got a phone call, so I just left after that. Any tips on how to exit a set better?

After that, I opened a girl with her friend (""Is this seat taken? No. Great, hey I'm Vulkreem""). She was pretty cool and we talked for a bit and I had her laughing a bit. After I left, the guy I was with introduced me to his set, and I was **awkward**. It looks like I'm a lot better with sets I open myself - how do I fix this?

After that we left the bar, and walked around a bit. Everything was pretty dead and another guy from the GroupMe came. We walked to Union Square (this was around 2am), and it was dead so we decided to head back. I was feeling kinda shitty, because I hadn't really had much success all night. I'd opened sets on my own which was pretty cool for me, but I was still pretty awkward.

I got to the subway station, and it kicked ass. A cute girl sat next to me and I opened her (I literally wouldn't have done this yesterday). We started talking, and another girl comes and sits next to me. The original girl leaves once her train comes, and the girl next to me opens by saying ""Did I hear you're Australian?!"". 

We get along really well, she was a little tipsy but mad friendly and I definitely ramped up the kino. I'm annoyed that I didn't kiss her, because there were so many damn opportunities. She tells me she's living in Brooklyn and that I should crash, but I tell her I have work tomorrow so I can't, and I tell her to crash at mine. She agrees, and I'm thrown off. Definitely didn't expect that.

I'm trying to work out logistics, and I realize I need to get up at 7 in the morning for work. I mention that and she decides not to come back with me because she doesn't want to be kicked out at 7. I didn't push for it (should I have?) because I felt like it'd be a hassle.

She also opens another girl who's sitting next to her and we all start talking. I'm super in-state, not in my head at all, and girl #2 asks how me and girl #1 met. I had my arm around her so she's surprised we met 10 minutes ago :)

Their train comes, they leave, and then mine comes so I leave.

**Sticking points:**

* I can't tease for shit, and I'm generally not very funny.
* Kino, kino, kino. If I don't kino when I first say hi, it's generally pretty hard for me to just start
* How do I not be in my head so much?"

With immunofluorescence, I have do determine whether Group A differs significantly from Group B. Each group consists multiple different samples (no duplicates or anything).  
I've scored the amount of immunofluorescence in both groups based on a scale of 1 (no fluorescence) to 10 (a lot of fluorescence). 2 others have also done this. If it were computer generated scores in triplicate, I would know what to do, but considering not not everyone gives the same score to the same amount of immunofluorescence, it gets a bit tricky. For example, my highest score is a 6, corresponding to sample 2 from Group A while the second person's highest score is a 7,5, corresponding to sample 2 from Group A. So we both agree that particular sample has the most immunofluorescence, but our scores differ quite a lot. Also, my data ranges from a 2 to a 6 with intervals of a quarter of a point, while the data from person 3 ranges from 3 to 7 with intervals of half a point. So it is not really about the score given, but more about the order in which the samples are arranged. And I cannot just average the 3 scores for each sample from each person. The problem is that I don't know which test to use whether group A differs significantly from group B.  Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance. "

It wasn't much but it helped pay the bills. I am certified in medical billing and coding and was hired with the intentions of being a biller. I did my billing work along with everything else due to being the only permanent employee there (most were interns). One of the protocols that they made clear was to ask each patient if they knew someone that had been in an accident. Most patients would say no and we would move on with our lives. I had one situation where a potential patient came in looking for information on our clinic. I made sure he had our pamphlet and business card. The treating doctor then took over the conversation and let the patient leave without any information on the patient. He refuse to give out his personal information because he was just gathering info on places. I got written up for this because in the clinic it was part of the protocal to take donw a person's info. Can they even do this? 

The second situation that caused the dismissal was some something similar to this. Patient was going to bring a relative that had been in an accident I told him it was fine. The person never came in and because I didnt have the potential patient's name and info the doctor saw this as a patient loss. I was let go because they could not risk loosing patients. When in reality I couldn't force people to give me their personal information. We never lost a patient we just didnt gain any. I am a single mom with bills to pay. I was hired to do billing not market their business can I do something about this? I live in Massachusetts and i am trying to read on my rights but can't find much. Thank you."

##Stats:

&gt;A/S/L and do you love where you live?
&gt;&gt;30-Something, New Englander. Life is good up here, if you're into mountains, good food and craft beer.

&gt;Relationship Status?
&gt;&gt;Legally binding.

##Favorites:

&gt;Cats or Dogs?
&gt;&gt;Growing up, we had a coon hound and a siamese cat. After those two moved on, we had a chocolate lab and a beagle, and then two more cats, and then we raised two of the cats those other two made...

&gt;&gt;Cats are fine, but I'm a dog person. We have a 3 year old [mutt shepherd pound puppy](http://i.imgur.com/hKdy3uc.jpg). People who don't enjoy dogs concern me. 

&gt;Favorite beverage?
&gt;&gt;I live on coffee, water, beer, and wine. And vodka. Give me the hoppiest IPA you can find and I'm happy. [Heady Topper](http://i.imgur.com/G2f701x.jpg), as a Vermonter I'm proud to see we managed to take over the #1 spot on BeerAdvocate.com's top 250 not too long ago.

&gt;Food?
&gt;&gt;The Reuben is the one true sandwich. 

&gt;Favorite movies/tv shows?
&gt;&gt;*True Romance* would have to be my all-time favorite film. Quentin Tarantino writes a better screenplay than anyone out there, not enough people appreciate this film. [Christopher Walken interrogating Dennis Hopper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3yon2GyoiM) is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. 

&gt;&gt;Honorable mention to: *The Jerk, Run Ronnie Run, Raising Arizona, Scorsese, Christopher Guest, and Woody Allen.*

&gt;&gt;For TV I grew up on Seinfeld, the Simpsons, X-Files and Northern Exposure. Then, The Sopranos, The Wire, Fringe, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Currently, Shameless, Game of Thrones, Parks &amp; Rec, and House of Lies. And Jeopardy every night.

&gt;Music?
&gt;&gt;I’m a degenerate Phish fan. But Primus, Sublime, Hendrix, Pantera, Grateful Dead, The Clash, NoFX, Bad Religion, John Lee Hooker...just about anything but that country twang.

&gt;Books?
&gt;&gt;*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* series is probably the top of my list. I found an old beat-to-hell paperback copy of *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* in a Ground Round parking lot when I was about 10, and I re-read them all every few years. Many years later, after a fellow redditor said 'No please don't', I created [r/vogonpoetrycircle](http://www.reddit.com/r/vogonpoetrycircle).

&gt;&gt;But Kurt Vonnegut is the best writer out there. Dry sardonic humor, and most everything he said was simply put and vaguely profound. Everyone should probably read everything he's written. 
I also have a weakness for [Stephen King](http://i.imgur.com/gTYC1m8.jpg?1). Growing up, me and my dad would read every King novel that we could get our hands on. 

&gt;&gt;And Hunter S. Thompson, Cormac McCarthy, Chuck Palahniuk, Mark Twain, Isaac Asimov, and Michael Crichton. Also others.

&gt;Games?
&gt;&gt;I've lost my gaming mojo over the last few years, I grew up obsessing over anything Tim Schafer; mostly Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle, and Monkey Island II.

&gt;&gt;I've spent years of my life at the poker table, and play some rummy, cribbage, and Risk. And as much disc golf as I can manage.

&gt;What is your favorite word or expression?
&gt;&gt;“Hey”. I use it constantly to acknowledge, without engaging, random people throughout my life.

##Miscellanea:

&gt;What makes you laugh?
&gt;&gt;Dry wit and jokes with some depth. Good humor should make a good point by taking something we overlook and exaggerating it to the point of absurdity.

&gt;What is your biggest pet peeve?
&gt;&gt;People. Specifically:
&gt;&gt;* When they don't pay attention during a movie.
&gt;&gt;* When I'm reading and they're doing something around me.
&gt;&gt;* When they leave **00:01** on the microwave.
&gt;&gt;* When they forget to remind me about something I specifically asked them to remind me of.
&gt;&gt;* When they wear looney tunes T-shirts in public.

&gt;What was the best thing about the last year?
&gt;&gt;Finally getting my parents to Fenway Park was pretty nice. 

&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead?
&gt;&gt;Same thing I look forward to every year. A week of camping with some friends for the 4th of July, out on an island just off the coast. It's my only good excuse to bust out [my America shorts.](http://i.imgur.com/xPuJE6m.jpg)

&gt;If you were granted one do-over, what would it be?
&gt;&gt;I'd have done some internships during college. Graduating with no experience makes it tough to claw your way up the resume pile when you're up against people who have actually done the job already. 

&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger?
&gt;&gt;My old college no longer allows students to use rocks or cinder blocks as doorstops in the dorms, because I was a moron. Which I assume has saved countless lives since implemented.

&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?
&gt;&gt;Being good to good people and letting the rest be.

##Concerning reddit:

&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name?
&gt;&gt;Kurt Vonnegut’s alter ego Kilgore Trout, and my old baseball jersey number.

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?
&gt;&gt;I’ve had lots of one night stands, two semi-regulars, but mostly just this one.

&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit?
&gt;&gt;The community. Some of you people are really good people. And there's someone around every corner that can teach you way too much about any random thing you'd ever like to know, if you look in the right places.

&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit?
&gt;&gt;My usual routine on a day off is grabbing a coffee, heading to the dog park, wandering over to the used book store, and then finding a deck to drink a pint and enjoy a meal of food. 

&gt;&gt;Other than that, I play some disc golf, read, go hiking, watch baseball or listen to it on the radio.

&gt;What subreddits, if any, do you moderate.   What about those communities do you like?   
&gt;&gt;[r/fantasybaseball](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball), [r/vogonpoetrycircle](http://www.reddit.com/r/vogonpoetrycircle), [r/politics](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/)

&gt;&gt;I took over r/fantasybaseball a few years ago, and it’s grown from 50 to 6,000 pretty quickly, and I’m just starting to draw in some regular writers and “baseball experts” to do some random IAmA style things. And I’m a fantasy baseball addict, so they may not realize it but really I’m just using them to feed me good info all day long.

&gt;&gt;r/politics is tedious business, but I do enjoy a good heated political discussion, and the modmail’s entertaining enough to make it all worthwhile.

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?
&gt;&gt;Yes it’s very busy.

&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better?
&gt;&gt;I'm sure pros probably outweigh the cons.

##Final Question:

&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate?
&gt;&gt;No I think we’re done here.

I got 20 in Math, 29 Reading, 26 Science and 25 English. I'm working to bring up my math score.
I am first chair violist in my school's string orchestra. I am a soprano in Concert Choir and Women's Choir. I have been in six school plays/musicals, though I have not had a lead. I did understudy the lead last year. I've gotten a superior at the region level every year in both Viola and Soprano solos.
I have 5 years of science credits and an internship that I completed in a neuroscience lab over the summer. I worked on a research project and competed in my local science fair. I'm currently waiting to hear back from NASA to see if I qualify for an internship opportunity.
I've been extremely involved in my Parish youth group for the past three years. I've completed approx. 450 hours of service and gone on two mission trips to Native American Reservations. I am a Choir Alternate Officer in this Youth Group and am also a Middle School Youth Minister.
I'm not going to include my entire essay but I am currently writing my essay. It's about the death of my 5 year old sister from DIPG (a brain tumor). I am writing about the motivation and drive I was able to gain from her death and the love of neuroscience I've developed. I want to be able to incorporate the fact that, because of her I pursued science and due to that, I found that I love neuroscience in my work at the lab. I want to convey my dedication to neuroscience and my drive to live life to the fullest for myself and my baby sister.
I really, really love Scripps. I went on a college tour and absolutely fell in love with the campus. I also really like CalPoly SLO. I am taking summer classes and have one year of high school left. What could I do to better increase my chances of getting in to these schools/ what are my current chances? I'm currently working to bring my scores up. I would've gotten around 27 but I didn't do well at all in one section.
tl;dr What are my odds of getting into Scripps college or CalPoly with a 3.6 and a 25 ACT composite.

ADD ""bootcamp"" activity ideas?",4months2run,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1e256j/summer_has_started_and_i_need_to_make_some/,"(Skip to the next paragraph if you don't care about how I've come to the conclusion that I need to do some self-improvement) 
I'm a 20 year old female unmedicated undergrad junior next semester, and last semester was the worst of my life so far. I was late EVERY SINGLE DAY to all but one of my classes, every club meeting (that I was usually running as well), and most days at work. Not just one minute late either, usually 5 minutes, even 15-30 (without any good reason other than I forgot) at least once in every class that I was late to. I tried waking up earlier, tried eating breakfast, tried getting more sleep, tried setting all of my clocks fast by 5-20 minutes, skipped taking showers several days in a row, tried running, nothing worked. The only reason I wasn't late to one class was because it was directly after another and within the same building. I also turned in most of my homework late (bless my professors for even allowing that), even a final paper. And of course when I did my homework it was usually not fully done since I could never manage to either do it or just plain remember to do it about an hour before it was due. Luckily what I did do I very well since all of my professors remarked that it was sad that I was doing so poorly because of failing to complete assignments when I apparently understood the material. Tests have progressively become more and more of a nightmare over the years and by the end of this semester I needed over 20 full minutes to calm down enough to be able to read the questions fully, having at least learned that was where half of my lost points came from thanks to previous tests. This was my first semester with mostly 50+ student classes (its a very small college) and these huge lectures were a nightmare, usually resulting in me falling asleep or doodling in order to not fall asleep. When comparing my notes to my peers I found out I'd completely misheard huge points and therefore couldn't trust what I wrote. It was also a nightmare trying to keep my friends this semester since I kept forgetting to talk to them and forgot when dining hall hours were, resulting in me having to eat alone most days. My room was a huge stressful disaster zone. Laundry became carpet and I didn't let anyone even look past my door, hurting my social life again. I ran away from all the stress that accumulated by either zoning out, sleeping, or hyperfocusing on either a tv show or book series (usually book series, tv series takes days instead of hours to finish and I absolutely can't do anything else when I'm hooked on one, making them wayyyyy too dangerous for me- I could literally not care about eating or leaving my room for days if I get hooked while alone). I became so sick with anxiety by the end that I was throwing up at the thought of the paper final (6 pages, not the longest I've done either) and seriously considered walking out of my final tests (which were much better than I thought they would be much due to the extra hour we all got for them). I ended up having to pay someone to pack and clean out my room for me too, just barely managing to pack what I needed to take home on time to catch the plane. I absolutely cannot do this ever again. If nothing else, I don't think my sense of self worth will be able to handle it. I haven't let anyone know the full extent of how bad this semester has been, even made a freaking throwaway for this post, and am praying for C's at this point.

So I've decided not to do a full time job or internship this summer and focus instead on self-improvement to help me survive (and get over how depressing this semester has been).

**Things I think are important that I improve on:**
1) Attention span during long lectures/ability to read so much as a paragraph of my textbooks and retain the information

2) Time management

3) Organization

4) Sleep schedule

5) Stress management

**This is what I was thinking of doing:**
1) Having a strict sleep schedule that will mimic what I will have to do at school

2) Mindfulness meditation daily for at least a few minutes. I've done it once a week for a few weeks before and it was very helpful in clearing my mind. It's never been about quieting the mind, rather just being more aware of my thoughts and feelings as they come and go. It helps the most in preventing myself from drowning in ""I'm so stupid"" thoughts and I hope it can prevent freak outs when presented with more than one thing to do at a time.

3) Hot Bikram yoga a few days a week (I freaking love it and best, am *good* at it, but was too busy during school. I don't like other forms of exercise because ""I'm bad"" at them and therefore they're embarrassing...), I've heard regular exercise helps immensely with ADD.

4) Updating my blog every day, which will get me writing about something I love (its not a personal blog).

But I don't know how much those will help with time management which I think is the key to managing most every one of my problems.

I have 4 months of vacation, so I figure that's a good amount of time to have plenty of failures and restarts in making any kind of positive habit changes without any repercussions. Or am I naive? Haha.

Do any of you have any other concrete activity suggestions for ways I can practice the improvements I want to make?

1e23tx,0,2013-05-10,I just need to talk about how I have been feeling the past few years.,username1523,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1e23tx/i_just_need_to_talk_about_how_i_have_been_feeling/,"Well, I really need to type out how I have been feeling recently because I don't feel comfortable actually talking to anyone about this.  This is going to be really long so read whatever you want, I'm doing this for myself mostly.

I guess I'll start with a little information about myself.  I'm going to avoid as much detail as possible.  I am a female in my very early 20's and am nearly done with school at a four year state university.  My major is in a difficult engineering field.  I think that I have had a very normal middle class upbringing.  My scholarships pay for my college tuition.

In middle school I felt like I had a lot of friends and loved hanging out with them all the time.  Sometime in early high school I stopped having so many friends.  I felt awkward around people and never knew what to say in any situation.  I was very quiet.  I still had a few good friends and quite a few people that I talked with occasionally from the one musical extra curricular activity I participated in.  

Around this time I got really into a certain mmorpg video game and spent most days playing it when I got home from school.  I would frequently decline invitations from my friends and family to do things because I thought it would be more fun to stay home and play the video game.  This attitude persisted through sophomore and junior year of high school.  I had two boyfriends over this time, for about a few weeks each.  It started the same with both of them.  I randomly decided that I liked them, flirted with them until they asked me to date them, and then I basically did nothing with them and wanted nothing to do with them.  One of them broke up with me, and I broke up with the other one.  I basically felt nothing about those relationships, or ending them.

Senior year of high school I for some reason become interested in my friends again and hung out with them frequently.  I pretty much quit the video game for the year.  I also become interested in a guy that we will call Jack that was my year in school.  I flirted with him for a semester until he asked me out and we began dating.  I liked this guy a lot and was very excited about our relationship.  I couldn't believe that he was interested in me as I thought I was kind of a loser and had no chance with him.  

Fast forward to the next Fall, when I began college.  I was still in a relationship with Jack and we went to the same state university where a lot of people from our high school went to college.  I guess I was under the impression that college was supposed to be full of friends and fun, and I think I was disappointed that that was not my experience.  I was not in a sorority or anything like that, and neither was Jack.  I signed up for a women in engineering camp type thing for a few days before classes started to try and meet new people, and I really tried, but it was mostly awkward and I didn't make any friends that I kept in contact with.  I was rooming with two friends from high school in the dorms.   I was resentful of their college experience, as they both seemed to be making a lot of friends and always had events to go to or friends to hang out and drink with while I felt alone except for them and Jack. 

My relationship with those two friends slowly got worse.  I would frequently lash out and make fun of their classes or their majors, as I was an arrogant engineering major and thought their majors and classes were easy and useless.  I couldn't stand listening to them complain about how hard their communications class was.  For unrelated reasons I am no longer friends at all with one of them.  The other one and I are still very good friends and still live together.

This whole time I was spending way too much time with Jack because I felt like I had no one else.  We had one big fight freshman year because one of my roommates called me out for having him over too much, and then he blew me off the next day for dinner with my parents, and things spiraled downhill, but we got over it and never broke up.  I was basically resentful of anyone who had friends and went out ad had a good time doing anything.  

Sophomore year was a really bad time.  My classes got harder and more specific and I had no friends in them.  I wanted to go to major-specific events, but I didn't want to go alone so I stayed home.  I had still basically not made any new friends in college at all. I started working in a professor's research lab, doing menial work and actually somewhat enjoyed the company of my coworkers but never did anything with them outside of lab.  

I was taking the maximum allowed number of hours the second semester and was very stressed, and typically did not want to engage in any sexual behavior with Jack and snapped at him frequently.  I was making the best possible GPA this whole time which I think put a lot of pressure on me to continue getting A's.  I felt like it was really the only thing I had going for me and if I made a B I would be a mediocre loser without any friends.  I kept telling Jack that I was sorry for how I was treating him and that it would be better when I was no longer stressed.  I cried frequently.  I actually won the only award from my department given to sophomores that year.  That summer was not a very good time either.  I took one very stressful summer class, but after that was over in June I was extremely bored all the time.  I hung out with Jack a lot but that usually consisted of us both being bored together.  I wasn't really excited to see him anymore.

My junior year started and I applied to be one of the dozen tutors for my department that has office hours and plans events for sophomores and was accepted.  At this point some people in my class did actually know who I was since word had gotten around I guess that I did really well on the tests.  I had made two kind of new friends in my summer class because they were friends with one person that I knew from high school.  I was still really bitter about my college experience being pretty much worthless in terms of having any fun, and I knew that was probably my fault but didn't know what to do about it.

Jack had turned 21 so we could at least drink when we wanted to, which I saw as a good thing because we had had limited access to alcohol before.  We didn't drink much at all though.  I did get to know some of the other tutors but didn't get their numbers or do anything with them outside of events.  I still kind of dreaded going to the events and socializing.  

I actually made one friend that I had most of my classes with, but only because she is really friendly and pretty much forced her friendship upon me (which was a good thing).  I was starting to cheer up at this point as I had about three new friends in my classes, but still felt like it was pretty pitiful that they were my only friends as we were not close and they had plenty of other friends.  My relationship with Jack was okay.  I tutored someone privately that I ended up liking a lot.  We got along really well but haven't really hung out as he's a guy and I didn't really feel comfortable with that.

The last semester was actually not bad, although it was really rough grade and stress-wise.  I think I still got all A's.  I started being included in a group of people in my major basically through constant proximity since we all had the same schedule.  I went to a party with them recently and felt pretty awkward, but then went to the bars with a couple of them and had a decent time.  

I don't know what I think about Jack anymore though.  It's been eating away at me for a while that I don't know if I still want to be with him.  I feel like he constantly disagrees with me and I don't feel loved or supported, even though I see him trying and doing things for me all the time.  I don't feel like he is ever really interested in things I tell him or my stories.  I feel like we never do anything fun.  But I also think that might be me never thinking anything is fun or me not wanting to do things that could be fun.

I don't know if I could break up with him though.  I should still be attracted to him because nothing has changed but I am never really interested in sexual things and occasionally give in just so he doesn't complain or think I don't like him.  There's nothing wrong with him.  He does so much for me, but he doesn't tell me he loves me and I don't know... compared to how excited I used to be about him I don't know how to feel anymore. He makes me angry a lot when I try to talk to him about my feelings.  I tell him that I'm just not happy with my life and he doesn't understand.   He gets very sad and won't talk about it if I try to address problems in our relationship. 

What's bothering me is that I don't know why I can't feel happy.  I don't know what's going on.  I don't really feel strong emotions about anything.  My one new friend always tries to talk to me about her boy issues and I don't feel like I can relate at all, I try to give encouragement but I feel emotionally shut down.  I really love my family but I just don't feel like talking about myself at all when my mom calls and asks how things are going.  I usually give a few word answers and feel terrible about it because I'm not even interested in talking.

I am about to move for an internship over the summer and will be alone in my own apartment.  It should be really exciting but I don't even feel like I want to do it.  I don't want to deal with meeting new people.  The bad thing is I don't even feel that sad about being away from Jack all summer.  I've never been with anyone except him and I don't know how I feel about that.  I wish I could try being with someone else without hurting him or losing him in case it's the best I'll find.  Not that I even think I could find someone else at all.

I don't know... I think I have low self esteem.  I feel very unattractive all the time even though I know I'm not that bad.  It doesn't help that one of my only new friends (that's a guy) complains that there are no good looking girls in our major and how he never meets any attractive girls, etc, and he complains about this to me.  So I don't know if he's including me in that or what but it's a little sad.  I feel like if I did break up with Jack I would just be completely alone, I would be people's acquaintance third wheel type friend.  I don't really feel like anyone else would date me.  The best I've felt recently was when I was at a somewhat friend's house and their mom told me I was too attractive to be in my field.  I get a compliment like this every once in a while and it's usually the highlight of my month.  I used to post pictures of myself on the forums of my mmorpg guild because it made me feel better that people on the internet would compliment me.  I'm pretty embarrassed by this now.

I still feel like the only thing I have going for me is my grades.  I worry that I should be trying to go to grad school or something, but I also don't even want to deal with trying to apply and pick one and all that.  I have no idea why I picked my major, I feel like it's just something that happened.  I'm not that interested in it, but there's not really anything else that I like better.  I have practically no hobbies and don't even know where to begin as nothing sounds enjoyable.  I spent pretty much every day the last semester doing homework and studying or hanging out with Jack.  I don't know what I want to do with my life but I know that at the moment I'm not very happy, and I don't know what I can do to improve that.  

Now I have an overwhelming urge to edit this as it's long and probably doesn't say what I want to say but I'll just post anyway.  "
1e22xs,1,2013-05-10,"[22/m] First dating experience with (22/f), seeking guidance",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e22xs/22m_first_dating_experience_with_22f_seeking/,"First off, let me say I am terrified of being found here by a lurking friend. But oh well, I'll try to keep it informative enough to just give myself away, and short enough to miss a lot of information.

It starts with this girl. I've known her for a few years since she's been in my major, and in the past two semesters I've worked more closely with her in classes. Attraction developed, she was with a guy in a long-distance deal, but I pulled the nervous gunman card and expressed my interest while she was still with him. She said she was surprised, I hid it well. Then told me she was glad I finally let her know.

About a month later, she's broken up with the guy after they both agree it's for the best. It takes me two weeks after this to finally ask her to go out with me, and even though she's not available that Friday, she said she'd ""really like to some time"" and the smiley faces &amp; exclamation marks started showing up in texts.

So for the next week or so we kept on throwing ideas out there. Either one of us was working, or out of town, but it was raincheck after raincheck. Following a few beers one night, I invited her to come out to a bonfire and do some stargazing with me. She was passed out but responded the next day, disappointed that she didn't get my text. She hadn't been to a fire in a year (city folk...) and never really stargazed, or saw a meteor.

Finally I had enough beer one night to bare my inner manchild, and I texted her some really sappy, dripping-with-desperation stuff about what it's like for me when she lets her hair down, and something about wanting to hold her hand... She responded with ""I'm really blushing right now,"" told me that she wasn't good at this kind of stuff (what?), and then I took that opportunity to ask her if she wanted to grab a late breakfast after our final the following day. She said that sounded good, smiley face, hooray.

I should take this time to mention that we are now both aware of the fact that at the end of this semester, she is graduating and moving back home, while I am heading the opposite direction for an internship. So not many opportunities to see each other due to night jobs. I am actually writing this from said internship location, and the convenient time to see her is over. It will easily be a month before I even have an opportunity, and according to her summer plans she will be busy with family, and possibly getting a call back on a job that will seal the long-distance deal.

Anyhow, the ""date"" was OK. Since it was my first I didn't rightly know how to get to know someone on such short terms, so I asked her about her career plans, aspirations, etc. Nothing very personal, not even flirty. It went well, she said she wants to hang out more, and she alluded to coming back down to the college town over summer (where I will be finishing my degree) to have some local fun. I didn't immediately recognize this as her desire to come back and spend time with me, so I just kinda let that subtle invitation pass unnoticed.

The date ended with a very awkward goodbye, as we both drove to meet at the restaurant, and I had no idea how to leave without just saying ""Well, I guess I should go."" She acknowledged it with a kind of ""oh..."" face and a few words, but I walked off much too quickly and I feel like I didn't quite communicate that I was having a good time. In retrospect it seems like I kinda ran from the place.

What am I even doing? I don't know, and any advice at all is appreciated. I wish I had more clear-cut questions, but I've decided to text her less. She told me to send her pics of the stuff I'm doing at this internship, so I may wait a handful of days and then send her a picture or two...

Suggestions? Questions? I'm all ears... TL;DR:

&gt; went on first ever date, it was odd for me but she was okay with it, &amp; seems interested. distance is now the only big factor. what do i do; regarding staying in touch, etc?"

1e20go,0,2013-05-10,"Summer job complication; I don't know who to trust. I need some advice, badly.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1e20go/summer_job_complication_i_dont_know_who_to_trust/,"Let me give some background first. I worked my ass off in school, and ways credible, etc, etc. My math teacher approached me and asked If I would like to interview for a job as an intern for a summer job. The job would pay $15, and I would be mainly be doing infrastructure mapping (surveying, creating maps on the computer, etc).

Now, I already have a job as a life guard, and get paid $11/hour. I enjoy my job, and it's quite easy. The people I work with i have no complaints, except my boss. My boss is a 'good' guy in a sense, I enjoy him and don't mind working for him. Except, his image has degraded in my mind. I stupidly informed in that I would be interviewing for this internship, as I had respect for this man and didn't want to quit out of the blue (lesson learned: never tell your boss about other jobs you maybe taking). He then goes behind my back, and tells other people to apply for this job so it would be harder for me to obtain it. What. The Fuck. Coincidentally it was my year review and he told me that he really enjoyed me as an employee, and wouldn't like to see me go. **He then confessed about telling people about the job, but he claims he didn't mean to.**

Well, time goes on and I interviewed (horribly) and found more details about the job. I would like to be doing computer-related tasks as I'm going to be a compsci major, and surveying wouldn't fit too much with that (or data entry for hours). Well, they're in need of people badly so I was offered the job to strictly digitize these maps. 

Now you see my problema. Now, I don't think I would enjoy this job, but my parents see differently. One does not simply obtain an engineering intern out of high school, so my parents are ecstatic about this. This could help my future career, etc; the problem is, I don't want to do this, or at least, I think I dont' want to do this. Yet, they keep pushing me, and are not acting as an non-biased figure in this problema. Should I keep my job as a lifeguard (with a boss who's nice, but backstabbed me ""unintentionally"") or take the boring engineering intern. I don't know what the fuck I should do.

I'm easily manipulated so I don't know who to trust. I can't trust my boss as he is clearly biased, he wants me to stay and  work for him. **I can't trust my parents because they want whats best for me on A FUCKING RESUME, not for my FUCKING LIFE.**

What I want to do, is develop software. Develop games. Develop websites. I do all these things already, but I haven't much over this school year as I have been pressed with school. This summer is the time for these things to happen. I would only be working 20-30 hours a week as a lifeguard, as opposed to 40 at the engineering firm. Lifeguard = more down time to develop games and websites. That's what I love to do. 

I just don't know though. **Maybe I'm manipulated by my boss as he did make some convincing arguments why I shouldn't take that job.**  I don't know if thats truly turning me away from this job or what. I just don't know. I can't seek guidance from my family, as they view me as 'lazy' for not taking this job.

I just can't make the fucking decision. I just fucking can't.

So I made a pros + cos list.

**Lifegaurd**

Pros

-Free time to spend with friends

-Guaranteed hours + jobs + off time

-Easy job to do

Cons

-Boss betrayed my trust (somewhat regained it, as he confessed that he accidently told someone else about the job)

-Not an engineering job 

**Engineering Internship**

Pros

-Pays well


-Looks good on a resume, will help with future jobs

Cons

-Boring

-Not related very much to field

-Doesn't allow me to pursue my dreams.

-Not flexible (no vacation time :( )


Honestly at this point I'm just fucking done, and I'm going to reject the engineering position. That's the decision I think I've made, but would like input on this situation. I can't trust myself as ideas can easily be implanted into my brain, and I don't know I can ever trust my boss again. On the flip side, I don't think I will like the engineering job, but is that because I've been told I wouldn't like it by my boss?

I need to learn how to make decisions on my own, but please, **I need unbiased insight on this situation.** 

Thank you for reading. 

TL;DR Boss backstabbed me while applying to another position, and might have manipulated me into not taking an engineering internship. I can't seek my parents for guidance as they are biased and don't consider what I want but rather what would make my resume look better. 

edit: I'm going to bed. Exams this whole week, dead tired, will respond in the morning.

Anyways, after messing around for a bit, I met a guy for dinner (talked on grindr for introductions, then got dinner, and long story short we started dating. That was about 3 months ago, and we have been dating since then. The problem im having is that i feel like we aren't compatible enough beyond attraction, like I am forcing myself to be his friend, and its not naturally how it is. We have little in common in terms of activities, sports, music, etc, and every time we hung out for the first 2 or so months was based around fooling around, not common interests. This is my first time dating a guy seriously, and it's my boyfriend's first time dating a guy at all. He told me he loved me about a week ago, and I couldn't bring myself to say I loved him back. 

He is leaving soon for an internship and will be gone all summer, and tonight we said good bye to each other, and I really felt sad, but it wasn't because he was leaving, it was because I know he will miss me so much, and I just cant bring myself to feel the same way. I feel like a jerk, but I kind of expected this to happen because of how our relationship started.

Anyways, I don't know what to do anymore. I really feel badly for not liking him as much as he likes me, and I wish I could, but it seems like every time I'm with him now I just notice more things about him that make us incompatible or just bother me. Is it time to end things now? Advice?

I'm open to advice as much as I am open to employer connections.

So let's get ""the sell"" out of the way: I was in the top 10% of my class (cum laude) at a top-10 CSE program (University of Washington), I graduated in June of 2012 and now I work on Rails applications that serve 200mm requests per month.  About 75% of my coding is Ruby, maybe 20% JavaScript, 5% odds and ends.  I'm pretty good at my job and have been formally recognized by my employer as a top executor.  I can provide strong references.

Now, the unpleasant truth: I have no idea what I want to be coding.  I don't feel like Rails is right for me; Rails feels like it's not far from Wordpress, I really fear becoming a ""web developer"" if I stay on this path.  I want to do more mobile development but even entry-level positions list ""have an app in the App Store"" as a requirement and I don't feel like I can afford to split my focus with a significant side project, my Rails work would suffer.

And so I'm looking for any attractive learning opportunity. Compensation, etc, that all comes second to: what can I learn working for you? My ideal opportunity is one that involves iOS and/or Android app development.  I'm open to being an ""intern"" again, or ""contract-to-hire"", or whatever else makes you feel safe.  I'm confident I could learn quickly and output good work, and I have enough cash saved that that's not an immediate concern. Above all else, I want an energetic, collaborative team, with a solid product strategy and challenging problems.  Preferred Seattle, NYC, or SF -- but I prioritize the job over location.

I don't have any major complaints. I also have no intention to part ways with her. 

However, here goes:
My gf always had a very restrictive childhood because of her conservative and over protective parents. As a result she has always fancied a more happening/adventurous lifestyle that includes travel, sports and so many more things. I've consciously tried to be as supportive as I can, towards this. Thanks to the distance, she has been doing things all by herself or with friends for the last couple of weeks and months. 

Now that she is pursuing her internship, she has a bit of financial independence and time on her hands. She has been treating these two months as a letting-herself-go and having-fun period. I'm with her on this but I find some (very few) of the things she wants to do a little too impulsive and immature. 

For eg: 

1. She wants to go check out the most unsafe area in her city because she's curious. I ask her to reconsider since I'm concerned for her safety but she overlooks it all and says she'll be ok. 
1. She doesn't usually drink but she has jumped at every opportunity to go out drinking and gotten really tipsy. To a point where someone has to escort her all the way back home.


I feel helpless. I'm don't like imposing my ideas or opinions on her but I really hope she respects my requests. She has been pretty dismissive about the seriousness of some of my concerns. (If she by any chance reads this, she'll tell me I'm thinking/worrying too much). Please note that I'm from a country which is known to be terribly unsafe for women and that's where my concern/fear stems from. 

I am on the verge of starting my own business and that has been very taxing. After 15 grueling hours at work, it gets to a point where I don't feel like trying to convince her any more, but that constant fear seems unnecessary and gets really annoying.

How do I get around this?

**REALLY Long Story**

My anxiety issues first really appeared junior/senior year of high school - pretty much during the whole college application process. I just found myself getting really nervous about the prospect of college and my grades. So, I stayed home a lot. Which led to me failing a Biology class. Which made my fears even worse.

I ended up fine, graduating on time and being accepted into my first choice. I figured that the jitters I was having were part of your typical high school experience. Except, they never left. 

I went to a college out-of-state, 8 hours away. I experienced some homesickness (thinking about mom would make me well up) but I adapted well enough, made some friends, went to parties and joined some clubs. I thought everything was fine. Then I started having my doubts.

My school was very small and the degree program was very focused - you pretty much needed to declare your major freshman year to graduate on time. I was going to study zoo keeping. One of my friends, however, broke down the math one night. She was trying to justify why she was transferring out. I don't think she realized what she was doing. As I nodded and agreed with her, I felt that redhot feeling of doubt in my stomach again. She rambled on about how much it would cost to attend our school, our prospected salary, how much debt we would have to pay off... I got scared, started having near-nightly panic attacks about my future. I hid it well (I always hide it, I'm a very good faker) but I became more withdrawn, stopped hanging out with my friends. At the end of the year, I transfered out.

I thought I was being too rash with my decisions. So I got a job at a vet's office, taking a year off to decided what I wanted to do. Of course, it turned out to be one of the most stressful jobs ever. My manager, though I don't think she meant to be mean, was a nitpicker. Everyday when I left for home I knew there was something that I missed, that I would probably get lectured the next day. The Doctor was a dick. Since the turnover rate was high, we were short staffed most of the time. I was originally hired to work the kennel. I ended up being promoted to a tech. I had no experience in this field but I was running tests, holding dogs, learning to take blood. I was stressed all the time. I cried in my car during lunch all the time.l This was almost everyday for the next year.

I fantasied often about plowing my car into a tree on the way to work, just to get away from the stress. At home I was probably a monster, I was always snapping at my family and constantly on edge. You know those chills you get when you get really scared or nervous? I had those everyday.

Last year I got accepted in a nearby college that my friends attended. I was able to quit my job. For the first year I lived in a house of six people and had a blast. I originally entered thinking I was going to pursue an English degree but, again, I became concerned about the future. So I transferred into the business school. 

I don't why I did it. It was horrible. I tried being attentive but I found myself feeling over my head. I don't know why, I knew the material but I became lackluster. I didn't have any energy to get out of bed. I missed a lot of classes. My grades suffered. I started getting those nervous jitters again, school was constantly on my mind but still, I found myself chained to my bed, looking at my clock knowing that I was missing classes. I was both terrified and uncaring. I ended up being placed on academic probation and had a nervous breakdown in my car, scared I was going to flunk out of college. Called my mom, cried about my problems. I also - get this - lied to her and told her I was talking with a counselor. I wanted her to think I was getting help, I didn't want to worry her. The closest I got to actually seeking help was a voicemail I left for the school's therapist, asking to schedule a time to meet with him. I never heard back, so I never pursued it.

I got some of my shit together this year, worked hard and got taken off academic probation. Found a major I really enjoyed (despite the fact my job outlook is still poor), found a new hobby (photography), got an internship at my local paper, a column in my school's newspaper. I even applied to become an editor at my school's newspaper and I have a good feeling I got it.

Everything is going pretty good, right? 

Nope.

These anxiety fears are now constant, no matter how good or bad I'm doing it's always there. Money, grades, my future, finals - I feel like I'm always tiptoeing around, that I'm about to breakdown again even though I can't pinpoint a reason why. It's like I'm waiting for something to happen. 

My parents went out of country to attend a wedding, I was left to watch my siblings. We were left $600. There's less then $100 and I don't know where it all went. I have rent due in a couple hours, $400. I have $10 in my bank account. My mother already said not to worry about it, but I am. I had a panic attack. Those thoughts of just... being dead are still rampant. 

Then Allie, of Hyperbole and a Half, came back and discussed her battle with depression. I realized that a lot of what she was dealing with was what I have been constantly battling for the last three years. She wrote something along of lines of wanting to be dead but not actually wanting to kill herself and it was so close to home that it scared me.

I'm just tired guys. I just want to wake up one day and be normal. I'm sick of being sad or nervous all the time, it's really starting to wear on my... well, nerves. I want to stop having this thoughts of just... being dead. I want to stop being mean to everyone around me. So that's why I'm finally asking - where the hell do I start?"

1e1hb6,0,2013-05-09,Complicated relationship with this guy for almost 7 years. (M22)(F22),[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e1hb6/complicated_relationship_with_this_guy_for_almost/,"I’m having trouble understanding my ex boyfriend. It’s been really hard on me lately and I just don’t know what to do and I’m so confused all the time. To start at the beginning… we started dating when we were 16 and continued dating till we were 20. At that time I was living with him, we broke up because I got confused about having feelings towards someone else and I didn’t want it to cause problems. I tried to stop talking to this guy but it didn’t work. So I eventually moved out. A month after I moved out and we were trying to be friends, he told me he couldn’t talk to me anymore because he loved me. I didn’t know what to do about this because I was afraid it was just because he was alone. We stopped talking for about 4 months, until I saw him walking on our college campus. We ended up seeing each other a few days later and we ended up having sex on and off for about 4 months until he moved away for a summer internship. After 3 months, he came back and we ended up having sex two more times. Then I broke down and said I still loved him and it was killing me to just be friends with benefits. So I told him that I couldn’t talk to him or see him anymore about 7 months later I ran into him on campus, and he invited me over for dinner, I declined saying I wasn’t ready. I then later texted him that I was sorry for being kind of cold towards him and that I would like to have dinner soon. I eventually had dinner with him and it was nice catching up and everything.  We started texting about twice every week after that. He’s graduating from college now and is moving away for work. He had been saying that he wanted to hang out some before he left. I hung out with him last night. But before I tell you about that let me tell you some of the things he said to me. One night his apartment got broken into, the one we used to share, and he said that he wished I was there. A while after that he told me that he has dreams about me almost every night. Sometimes nightmares, sometimes sex and stuff, also commenting on how awesome of a girl I am and how he thinks I’m beautiful. So now onto last night, we went out to dinner and we were having great conversation.  Several times he refers to it as a date… and he paid for the meal. When we walked out he put his arm around me and when we got in the car, he started to hold my hand and said he just wanted to see if it still felt the same. He then asked if I want to come to his place and drink of few beers… I said yes ( like an idiot) and we drank a few then he started to kiss my cheek and well it escalated. I stayed there and he woke up and kissed me… and when he took me home he said he’d like to see me again before he left and then kissed me goodbye. I just don’t know what happened to be honest… he says he doesn’t love me and I believe him, I just don’t understand his actions. Please if anyone could just help me understand…I’d appreciate it. Thanks. "
1e1h0b,43,2013-05-09,Should I feel bad for leaving work at 5pm?,jobsthrowaway2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1e1h0b/should_i_feel_bad_for_leaving_work_at_5pm/,"So I'm an unpaid intern and work from 9-5 but come in everyday around 8:30 to get started early on my work and I'm usually done with my work by 5pm so I leave. In some cases I stay till 5:30-6pm if I need to finish something I can't do the next morning.

A lot of the other people (who are actually getting paid) stay like an hour or more after work finishing up their work to meet deadlines (the atmosphere in the office is pretty lax and I feel like there is a lot of goofing off).

Today I left at 5:10 and one of the guys left at 5pm and the boss came in and said, ""Oh the fiver left, what a surprise"". It made me wonder if he says that about me when I leave? But at the same time, it's an unpaid internship and if I'm not getting paid I'm not interested in staying late. But I am also hoping to get hired on after my internship is over."
1e1gfr,2,2013-05-09,"Need college advice, narrowly missed academic probation this semester and don't know how to pick up the pieces",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1e1gfr/need_college_advice_narrowly_missed_academic/,"Sorry for the long backstory....  Basically starting college I didn't know what to do with my life, so I majored in Biochem and set my hopes on applying to medical/pharmacy school, despite the fact that I've always been terrible in science and never had a much interest in the field (my entire family is in the medical field, so I suppose I felt a little pressure). I did surprisingly well though and maintained a 3.6 GPA, although my highest grades were in my general ed classes (I made As in every non science class I took).  Then, sophomore year, I got a job in a pharmacy and hated it.  I was also becoming burnt out from taking upper level science classes that didn't interest me, so I panicked and decided to transfer to another university and get a degree in hearing sciences, then apply to grad school for audiology.  My reasoning for audiology being: medical field, high demand job, not as much rigorous science.

This is where things fall apart.  Had trouble making friends, had trouble adjusting to my new uni which, in retrospect, was a terrible fit for me.  Lost quite a bit of weight and was even worried that I was developing an eating disorder.  Looking back, this is the point where I should have sought counseling, asked for help, etc.  Stupidly, instead of doing any of these things, I panicked once again and decided that I had picked the wrong major, and if I changed my major everything would be better.  This was by far my biggest fuck up.  I switched to nutrition science, based on the fact that I had many requirements for the major already filled from my previous biochem requirements, and a mild interest in nutrition.  (My first semester GPA was 2.1 by the way.)

Although the next semester (this past spring) got better towards the end, it wasn't soon enough.  Things were still bad at the beginning; I still didn't have many friends and was pretty isolated and really sad.  Nutrition science is more demanding than hearing sciences, and I barely had any motivation to keep going.  I should have dropped classes, probably even should have withdrawn from my semester, but I didn't.  I thought if I forced myself to keep going things would get better.  Grades were still terrible though and I now have a cumulative GPA of 2.00.  The minimum not to be on academic probation.

Outside of academics, at the end of the semester things began to shape up.  I got a fun part time job that I'll keep this summer/next year, made more friends, am soon moving into an apartment with a great roommate, and was pretty happy the last few weeks of school and genuinely left feeling like I belonged there.  The last couple weeks of school I was actually happy, felt like myself again.  It's too bad these things didn't happen earlier, or I probably could have salvaged my grades.

The problem is, where do I go from here academically?  I am signed up to retake the classes I did bad in this summer, which would drastically raise my GPA.  I know I am capable of getting As in these classes if I retake them.  But that doesn't change the fact that I am in a challenging major with only a 2.0 GPA, and I have no job prospects with this major without going to grad school.  I will never be able to get a job doing research in a lab or an internship with my current grades, which are a necessity for my major and for applying to grad school, not to mention that I don't even think research is something I would like.  

Overall I made a terrible decision switching into this major, and I don't know if, after I retake classes, I should suck it up, and finish in this program, because I'm already a senior and this is what I committed to doing, or if I should find another major I'm interested in and good at and could still probably graduate in the same amount of time.  I just hate how indecisive I feel, I feel like I've lost my mind.  Most frustrating is that the classes I did bad in here were still easier than the many of the classes I took as a biochem major, and I know that I could've done really well under better circumstances.
I suppose I'm just looking for any suggestions, or anyone who can relate."
1e1foz,3,2013-05-09,"Not even looking for people to read this - Just need to write something about my disrespectful, lazy, live in boyfriend, or I feel like I will explode at him. Glad this sub exists!",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1e1foz/not_even_looking_for_people_to_read_this_just/,"It's really frustrating. He doesnt do much around the house, and it kind of hurts my feelings, really. All of the advice on Reddit is ""talk to him, tell him how you feel"". Welp, I have, a ton of times, and nothing really changes. Instead of getting angry about it, I actually get hurt. I want him to want to help me out, ya know? 

We split up the chores when we first moved in together, but there's never been one week in the almost full year weve been living together that he has done them without 1) me asking, 2) doing a half ass job. One of his chores is to take the trash and recycling out, but he will wait until they're literally overflowing and smelling. It's so overflowing that we have to put recycling items next to it, we cant even fit it inside. Still, he doesnt even take it out. Before we moved two weeks ago we had a big back porch and he would just take the bag out of the trash can and put it on the porch. One time I counted and there were 7 bags back there. He was too lazy to bring them to the dumpster. I think he thinks it's normal, but Ive never had a boyfriend be so disrepectful or just plain disgusting with that. When I tell my friends or have them over they are grossed out, too. I know I'm not the crazy one. 

I should also mention that his only chore was to take out the trash and recycling. I clean the house, do all of our laundry, take care of the cats solely, and only recently (1 week ago) asked him if we could switch off with scooping the yard (we have two dogs) and the dishwasher). I do all the vet appointments. If there is something wrong with the house I set up and meet with the plumber, etc. I handle all of the bills. His dishes are constantly piling up in the sink and smelling, even when we have a dishwasher 1 foot away. His dishes pile up so high that sometimes I cant even refill our Brita and have had to use the bathroom sink on a number of occasions - and just to even wash my hands sometimes.

He complains that he's busy. He works as an engineer, and does work hard. I dont mean to make it a contest, but I hate that excuse.  He works full time and volunteers for 1 organization. I work full time at a non-profit, volunteer full time for two organizations, am in grad school full time, AND just started an 8 hour a week internship. It's really, really, really hard to take it all on.

We have two dogs and he doesnt do anything for them besides walk ONE of them in the morning. He doesnt take them to the park, doesnt spend time with them. When he gets home from work he just lays on the bed. I'll get home and ask ""have the dogs been fed?"" ""no"" ""have they been let out"" ""no, I JUST got home"". Well, they're living creatures, man. Theyre youre responsibility. 

He adopted a dog last February before we moved in together that ended up tragically passing away a few months later. For the first few months he would walk her everyday, 5 miles a day. Why wont he do that with our dogs (1 was mine before, and 1 we adopted together)? It's like the second we moved in together he lost all of his responsibility traits. He used to come home every lunch break to let his dog out. He's never done that once with ours. Not once. He knows I will take care of them and obviously not let anything happen to them, so it's like he just sits back and lets me handle it. They're two big lab-mixes. Theyre sweet hearts, but a ton of work. I guess I should have saw it coming, because before we moved in together I was the one who ended up taking care of his dog at his apartment. I would go over on my lunch break and let her out for him. Towards the end, I saw her more than he did.

I am so drained with work, volunteerships, internships, taking care of our pets, AND trying to be a good girlfriend. I just broke down and cried the other day in the shower from exhaustion. I am also a damn good girlfriend. Being on Reddit has made me realize how good of a girlfriend I am. It's also made me realize that he's kind of... shitty. I cant believe some of the stuff guys on here do for their girlfriends. I dont need an award, but I would love a ""thanks"" every once in a while. Some recognition, ya know? I literally dont ask for anything. I split everything financially, I'm not clingy, I have sex with him WHENEVER he wants and give him head 4 - 5 times a week without ever asking to cum on my own. It's been weeks since Ive cum, but I dont complain or say anything. I'll just take care of myself on my own time.

On top of it he kind of puts me down a lot. He's made it clear on more than one occasion that he thinks his work is more important than mine (I work with animals in the nonprofit world) or that hes busier. Tells me I cant do certain things, ""youll screw it up"", micromanages when I am taking a project on on my own. It really fucking hurts.

I volunteer as a rape crisis hotline advocate, and I'm also a ""survivor"" myself. Never once has he asked me how I'm going or how it's affecting me. We also have a huge issue going on at my organization right now that is affecting the dogs at work. Staff is so upset that people just break down crying in the halls. HR had counselors come in for us to talk to. He never asked me how I was handling it, updates, or if I was okay. Again, not looking for attention, but even a quick ""you doing okay?"" would mean the world to me.

With all that being said, I think this frustrates me the most because he is genuinely a good guy. He is truly one of those ""nice guys"" girls talk about. I really did luck out in terms of having someone that is trustworthy. I would literally trust him in a room full of naked girls and not blink. He does love me, and a lot, in his own fucked up way, though he doesnt really show it with his actions. He's just lazy, and thats what is so frustrating. Besides that, he's as perfect as you can get, so I guess you cant get everything you want, right? I would rather have a good relationship with someone who is a slob than a bad relationship with someone who empties the dishwasher regularly."
1e1cuq,2,2013-05-09,Does one **really** need a BS/BE/B.Tech. in Comp. Sci. to land a job in software development?,nuclearnadal,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1e1cuq/does_one_really_need_a_bsbebtech_in_comp_sci_to/,"Hello, /r/AskHR.

I graduated with a Masters in Information Science in 2011 from one of the Tier 1 institutes in India. Before that I completed a Bachelors in Information Technology (2010, by correspondence) and a Bachelors in Life Sciences (2009, full-time.)

Uptil December, I used to work at one of the largest Internet companies as an analyst. My job was mostly to review content and analyze data related to workflow issues, and suggest improvements with respect to the same.

I left the job, because I wanted to shift over to Software Engineering. My coursework includes most of the subjects taught in a regular Bachelors course in Computer Science. I can also code fairly well. While I don't have the experience of an internship, I have attended a summer school with a software giant. I also have a Masters project (related to GIS) to showcase my coding skills.

For the past couple of months, I've been prepping up and applying aggressively (through applicant tracking systems, job boards and referrals) to software companies in the hopes of an interview call. I think I have my resume and cover letter straight (keyword-optimized and tailored for each job.) However, all I've received uptil now is a rain of rejections. :(

A friend had asked for my resume a couple of days back to send to his brother, who works for a networking giant. Here's what the guy sent back:

*Problem is that this guy has not done a BE/B.Tech. and the minimum qualification here for being a developer/tester is a BE/B.Tech. :-(. Though his profile is quite interesting, they will definitely disqualify him based on that single criterion itself.*

A BE/B.Tech. in Computer Science is the indian equivalent of a 4-year BS in Computer Science. Software ompanies down here require a BE/B.Tech. in Computer Science *or an equivalent degree* for consideration for a entry-level job.

**Is it totally necessary to have a BS/BE/B.Tech. in Computer Science to land a job in software development? Does a B.Sc. in Information Technology \+ an MS in Information Science make the cut (assuming that the candidate has taken identical courses?)** I've landed interviews previously with two very big software companies (one through a referral, the other through a consulting firm,) but after reading this message, my brain seems to have frozen.

Am I asking for too much? If not, how do you suggest I go about this?

Thanks."

I have a decent amount of experience in what the internship calls (mostly class assignments and some little websites I made for fun) for but I'm worried about disappointing.

The job literally saved my life as I was heading on a very bad downwards spiral. I was hired full time and was tasked with basic level 1 stuff. Laptop repair, smartboard adjustment, and basic networking. I fought for a file server and new laptops for the whole school and made a great ticket site to keep things in check as well as managing the inventory with my coworker. But thats about it, the rest of it comes down to plugging in usb ports the right way and air dusting projectors that overheat.

However theres no incentive to do more than the very basics. The mdf and idfs are old and degraded, no domain controller, a decrepit wireless configuration that turns a 20mb up/down into 300kbps, owa 2003 managed off site that gives users 20mb of space, the fileserver is a mac because thats the only thing for sale and its trash in a 98% windows environment, theres an old content engine proxy that hits up a vip farm that gets in the way of everything, no wsus, no software updating procedure, we run out of license keys all the time, the users are a bit technologically inept and thats ok but some of them refuse point blank to learn anything more, we had a consultant come in and convince the school to buy ipads that have been nothing but a headache and i keep getting the feeling that the people i work with dont understand why all of this upsets me. 

The school has a gigantic budget but only about 25k can be computer related though I have to check since somehow we spent 450k on lenovos.

I dont know what steps to take to rectify any of this or if any of it is even worth it. Men and women of sysadmin, am i over reacting over a simple job or is this just what i should be getting used to in education?"

School: They decided to switch from a percentage system (max 100%) to a GPA system (max 4.3). Weird I know. So half my marks are in percentage and half in GPA using letter grades from F to A+.

Me: My first couple of years were difficult due to various issues. I never failed a course, but I have some pretty low and erratic grades. One term I had a 1.32 GPA. Eventually I was able to turn things around and have gotten a 3.7 term average the past couple of years. However, my cumulative average is still quite low (2.8 or so) due to the first couple of years.

Now that I'm looking for employment, any suggestion on how to approach this? I can easily see it being dumped to the bottom because it's so confusing to look at. Especially since my lowest grades are on the front page.

Note: I also had a 14 month internship midway through my degree, which appears on the transcript as three empty terms..."

I did some work for them, but I didn't have fixed office hours and my boss was really nice and let me be really flexible.

However, I got a girlfriend earlier on into the internship, and due to some emotional insecurities, etc, I really attached myself to her and didn't devote myself to the internship. I still did some work for them, but smaller projects that I did on my own, and even then it wasn't really that much.

So, I feel like I have kind of soured my reputation at this place. However, my boss was supportive (but almost *too* supportive. It was hard to get honest feedback because he wouldn't be critical).

Do you think it's worth asking for a 2nd shot (answer: probably yes) but how should I word the email? Do I explain what happened over the summer in a bit more detail, or just simply ask for another chance? Should I make promises that I will devote myself more? It just feels awkward, and I'm afraid of rejection even though I know there is really nothing to lose by just asking.

Thanks, I appreciate the support guys. Just don't know how to ask for another shot, and I'm a bit concerned with over promising and having a similar issue to last time."

After the rush, I went back to C2L's scripts, as she said she would be back later that evening.  I scanned them into the computer, and started entering them.  The oxycodone prescription popped up first on my screen. I enter it; the label prints. As the omeprazole script pops up, I do a double take. I reach over and grab the hard copies of the scripts, and look more carefully at them.  They are definitely DrM's prescription pad. No doubt there. C2L's name, drug, sig code, quantity, etc, all look like his typical semi-horrible handwriting.  

But his signature... it just looks off. 

Normally, DrM's signature reminds me of John Hancocks signature, all smooth and graceful. This signature, however, was more sharp and angled.  Thinking I was losing my mind, I dug around in a few profiles to find other examples of prescriptions from him.  None of them quite matched the scripts I had in my hands. I checked with Jen and she agreed it looked a bit funny but overall did look like a legit prescription.  She said to call the office and verify anyways.  After all, that's part of our jobs and her license on the line. 

Of course, the office is now closed. 

Knowing C2L was coming back that night, I hesitantly called Pharmacist M at home.  When she picked up, I told her I was calling with a question for her husband regarding a script and *profusely* apologized for calling them at home.  He doesn't mind and came to the phone. I asked him if he saw that particular patient that day.  He confirmed he had.  I then asked him if he wrote for a CII for her.  There was a *long* pause on the other end of the phone. He then replied with, ""No, I did not.  She asked for one, and I refused."" I thanked him, said I may be calling back later with more questions, and hung up.

Well, now. 

Never been in this position before.

I look over to Jen, who is looking at me expectantly. When I shake my head, her smile fades slightly. She reaches over to the store phone and pages overhead, ""Security to the Pharmacy at your convenience please."" We *never* page security to the Pharmacy over the intercom.  Only with our panic buttons, which I have thankfully only used once before (that's a whole other story). So Leo, our lovely off duty cop, turned security take his time coming over (who happens to be fairly good looking, totally non-relavent to the story, but anyways). While he wanders over, I start our local chain call (I am still unsure if this is a common thing in Pharmacies or not, so far all 3 stores I have worked in since have also had one) to alert the other Pharmacies in the area that there has been a fake CII Rx found coming from DrM's office and to be on guard. 

Leo arrives, giving us a funny look. Jen lets me explain to Leo what has happened, and I finish by asking him if he would like us to call the local cops for back up in case she comes back in or if he would like to handle it if she arrives (him being an off-duty cop and all, and currently our on-duty store security). He tells me to give him a few minutes, and walks quickly away.  (I found out later, he told the store directer he was clocking out, getting his gun and badge, clocking in as a cop, and going to be chilling with Pharmacy for a bit. He's a bit protective of us, can you tell?) In the meantime, I called the Walgreens across the street, found out they were in the process of also filling an Oxycodone script for C2L, and they promptly stopped filling it.

When Leo returns, he inspected the scripts, asked to see a real one to compare it too.  So I printed off an old copy from another patients profile, ripped off her name and DOB, and gave it to him, and told him about the Walgreen's Rx across the street as well. He walks over and looks at their Rx as well, and confirms that it matches my faked one. Calls DrM to confirm what I had told him. Over the next hour: not one, not two, not even three, but *Four* other Pharmacies contact DrM stating they have also received CII Rx's from him office written for C2L this evening. Knowing this was no longer just a one-faked Rx issue, and now likely an intent to distribute, other deputies were dispatched to these pharmacies for statements. Security cameras are watched. Statements are taken. DrM lives close to us, and he even came in and visually confirmed our Rx's were faked. By this time it was closing time for the Pharmacy, and C2L hadn't showed, but we were still getting reports from other Pharmacies regarding similar faked Rx's from that evening for her. Fourty-five minutes after we closed, Leo's phone rings.  He grinned at us (have I mentioned he's good looking?), and said ""We got her!""

The next morning, we got a bit more information from Leo: 9 confirmed faked Rx's for controlled substances, 3 were successfully picked up, she was caught at the last store on the other side of town, but only that third Rx on her person.  Success!

The scary part is: *if I hadn't known DrM well enough to know his handwriting and signature, I would never have known it was a fake prescription.*

**TL/DR:** Nice polite lady brings in faked prescriptions for controlled substances, we almost fill it. Cops arrest her a few hours later at another Pharmacy picking up another faked Rx. She forged a total of 9 Rx's, totaling nearly 1100 tablets of various strengths of Oxycodone. Only managed to illegally pick up 3 of them.

I am getting my masters online. My practicum (internship) is an online counseling service, thus I provide it at home. 

Right now, my youngest brother is having a psychotic episode. He is 18 and autistic. My parents aren't handling it ""right"". I hate it. They are trying, but I just feel they could be doing more. 

That is beside the point. 

The past three nights, he was woken me up because he has been screaming in the middle of the night. My parents tend to him, but still. 

Am I selfish? 

I have one more semester left, and it is a rigorous program.

Everyone tells me I need to get out, but I can't afford to. I'm waiting for my loans to come in for this semester, which may help with living costs. 

But for now, I'm so anxious for Monday to come. I have meetings for my internship and two classes. 

This sucks, and I'm getting depressed and more anxious.

This July i'm gonna stay for around 2-3 weeks in Vienna and I would like to follow a German course. Does any one of you know a reliable place where to do that? Not one from the top google search, which I guess are gonna feel like the shows offers outside the Opera :P

My level is not that bad, but it is far from good: i've studied for 7 years through highschool, but boy i'm bad at it! I also got Goethes Zertifikat Deutsch (which is a B1 level, and my score was ""befriedigend""...), but it was 5-6 years ago...

At all.",[deleted],stopsmoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1e5e2z/day_2_i_can_do_this_but_i_am_not_having_fun_at_all/,"I mean, yeah, nobody ever said quitting smoking would be fun. It's just, in the middle of the cravings and the hot flashes, it IS a lot harder to keep my motivations and reasons for quitting in mind than I expected. How can I hate smoking so much when I was still a smoker and then miss it SO BAD once I stop? I had regrets when I decided to quit smoking at 2:30 yesterday. I hadn't had a cigarette yet that day, I wanted to quit smoking once school was over for the semester but before the beginning of summer school. ""If not now, then when?"" So I did it.

I can do this though. I don't like being the only smoker in half my classes, it's embarrassing. School is my #1, and I'm tired of worrying if it affects my professors' perceptions of me, when I feel like I already have a lot stacked against me as is. I also have bad circulation; the idea of never getting the purple knees when I'm cold again is exciting. No more hacking up nasty shit. No more being stinky. No more a lot of other things. I fear for tomorrow, the infamous day 3, but so far it has been much smoother sailing than I anticipated. I'm telling myself once I get past day 3, it'll all be downhill from there, but I know that's really naive. But maybe lying to myself just to get there isn't such a bad thing; it'd be a lot harder to just make it to that point if I had a cynical outlook, wouldn't it?

Last week, finals week of all fucking weeks, was a series of little failures and devestations. Didn't get into the internship, now I have to do summer school (taking two upper level math classes having just finished two upper level math classes; I am so tired of math I can't even words) and not get paid $500 a week for it, my back-up employment plan fell through because my school's library isn't hiring over the summer, I totally bombed the final for my favorite class which was devastating, but I was so fried, man. Once again, the ever elusive A-in-a-math-class has slipped through my fingers. Yeah, this all sucks. But, hey, this is one thing I CAN control. Quitting smoking isn't going to be a jerk and put the stupid boundary of a curve problem on the final. It's all in my hands. My success is all on me. And if I slip up, I'm doing a disservice to no one but myself. I need a little taste of success and victory so bad, because all this has me so down. Here's my chance.

I've already accomplished things beyond what I ever even thought I was capable of in school. I have overcome a lot, including a learning disorder and being a right-brained bitch with an art background in a left-brained hard science. I have worked hard, harder than I have for anything else in my whole life. I worked through my self-doubts and failures by believing in myself anyway. This isn't any different, this can't even be as difficult, it's just... less pencil-and-paper, more dried up-plant-and-some-fire (or lack thereof). Right?

I can do it. This sucks, but I can do it.

No, I *will* do it."

1e58ch,5,2013-05-11,Apparently I can't even bring up the most basic social skills.,StanErSatan,depressed,https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1e58ch/apparently_i_cant_even_bring_up_the_most_basic/,"So, I have [ergophobia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergophobia) as a form of social anxiety and the fear of failing. At my school it is necessary to do an internship in a kindergarten and in a hospital for half a year to pass the year. Until now, I could deal with it. Of course, as a person with social anxiety it is probably the worst thing to work in a kindergarten or a hospital but since I have to go there only every two weeks I have time to catch a breath in between.

Well, I have been working at the hospital for two weeks now and last week, my teacher visited them and asked them if they were content with me (that's a normal procedure) and they told her that they were not. Allegedly I am unfriendly to the patients and don't seem to enjoy it. Which is absolutely not true. Despite my anxiety, I like to care for people and I am always very nice (smiling all the time, acting light-hearted (which even was too much, I think, because one patient maybe made a bit fun of it, lol)), at least I thought that. After the shitty job at the kindergarten I really was like ""Hey, finally something I like. Maybe I should even become a nurse"". Then my teacher told me this and I really don't want to go back there now. I am on ""probation"" now for two days and if I am not improving, I am fired and expelled from school as a consequence. I never thought it were *that* bad. Apparently I am even failing if I have the feeling everything is fine. I am working there for only two weeks now. How can one make such a bad impression in only two weeks? And I mean, I'm doing anything to seem nice and happy and everything (I am a bit of a melancholic person and maybe have depression) and I really thought it would work. I can't do more. It's exhausting already and I just *am not* that kind of person.  I've been crying for four days constantly and thought about killing myself. Would be so easy. In two days I have to go back there and I really don't want to.

I've thought about dropping out of school but 1. this whole fucking year would have been for nothing (and it's over in 1,5 months), 2. I want to delay having to work (after this year this internship is over and then I have to go to school a few years without having to do any internship again) and 3. all of the jobs I would like require this school. But I really don't know. Also, these social skills are important anytime in my life. By dropping out of school it doesn't change anything. I basically can't run away. I just don't think I am really ""made"" for life or that I can ever handle this.

*Sorry about this mess and wall of a text (English is not my native language) and sorry if this seems petty. Just wanted to vent.*

**TL;DR or didn't understand: I'm afraid of failing and have social anxiety and I'm currently doing an internship at a hospital which is necessary for school. Thought everything was fine there, was told then that the employees at the hospital were totally unhappy with me because I seem unfriendly. If I don't improve I'm fired and expelled from school in 2 days. Depressed, crying and suicidal for 4 days now because apparently I'm no good for anything.**"

I recently got a job after this year of university ended, but it doesn't pay highly enough or have enough hours to fully support myself. So, I moved back in with someone that I lived with previously, who has been nothing but abusive, awful, and masochistic in the time I have spent with them. At the time, I had no other living arrangement options. I have been diagnosed with depression and have some pressing medical conditions. They are forcing medication and procedures on me that I cannot handle. I believe that if I stay in my current situation, I will not last long. Literally and figuratively.

I'm a 20 year old female going into her 4th year at the University of Pittsburgh. I'm studying Accounting and Finance but would be open to any type of job. I have a great resume with several awesome internships (none of which are re-hiring right now) and good experience. I work hard, and I can keep my depression in check when I am not constantly bombarded the by sexism and abusive I am currently facing. I'm also obviously looking to move, but I only have about $500 dollars saved up. I don't need a job with benefits, I just need one that pays so I can move out. I have transportation. I don't mind relocating.

1e54sa,0,2013-05-11,My Lawyer was a Politician…,[deleted],unitedkingdom,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1e54sa/my_lawyer_was_a_politician/,"My Lawyer was a Politician…

I was recently arrested and afforded a lawyer by the State; the only problem was that he was a Politician. I had three weeks until my trial and trusted my lawyer to fight my corner.

By mid-way through the first week I hadn’t heard from him and we hadn’t actually discussed my case or the details of my alibi. We had no meetings, no calls. I finally got through to him on the Thursday and he explained that he’d been busy networking with other lawyers and people from the legal profession – for my sake. I wasn’t entirely sure how him dining with big wigs in the legal profession really helped my case and I was concerned that maybe he was busier politicking for his own career, rather than my life - but I pushed my doubt to the bottom of my gut. After all, he is the lawyer – he must know what he’s doing.

On the second week I got a txt that read “will run campaign 4 u, LOL, Dave”…I was confused and promptly requested to meet with him, was he mocking me? He explained that he thought LOL stood for ‘Lots of Love’ and at this moment I began to question both his sanity and intelligence – how could one be so oblivious? I asked if we could discuss my case, he placed his right hand on my shoulder and assured me that all would be ok and that he had somewhere to be and left. I began thinking about preparations for a life behind bars.

The final week had begun and we still hadn’t spoken about the actual facts of my case. He called me whilst he was walking between a ‘working’ brunch and a ‘working’ lunch. I pressed the matters of the facts of the case and he explained that his assistant and interns were drawing up some briefings for him now and he would read over them from his blackberry. He then began to sing…”no Whyalla wipe-out there on my TV, no Whyalla wipe-out” – it didn’t make any sense!

The trial came and there I was, sat in the dock with no savior and no sense of redemption. The Judge asked that the defense council rise, my fear froze for a second but my hope continued, I murmured ‘please, surprise me’.

My lawyer stood…”Members of the jury, my client is innocent…. for the Prosecution is incompetent. This Prosecutor lost his last case, he had that opportunity to put a similar defendant behind bars and failed, so you see – how could my client possibly be guilty?”. I couldn’t believe it – what the hell? Was this some Lawyer thing? Was he a genius or really this bad? I quickly looked to the Jury to gauge their reaction - two nodded along vehemently in complete agreement, and one shook her head - she was horrified by his argument. I didn't get it, how did they have such strong opinions based on so little? Most, however, looked confused but played along through fear of looking stupid. They were clearly wondering what it was that they weren’t getting, but in reality, there was nothing to get. You see, the stupid were, in fact, the smart.

Once my Defense council have finished his opening speech, the Prosecution rose…To my amazement his first words were “No, members of the Jury – the defendant is guilty because it is in fact the Defense council that is useless!” I sighed with relief, you see, the Prosecution lawyer must also have been a Politician! He continued “the Defense council’s loss to win ratio is 18.2 to 9” – I saw that nobody knew what this meant but the Jury continued to play along in order to look ‘with it’. “Objection!” shouted my defense, “he has abused the statistics, my ratio is 3 to 14!”. Numbers were just being shouted across the Courtroom, nobody knew how these numbers were thought of, nor what they stood for anymore but somehow they always proved, beyond doubt, that whoever was saying them was correct.

This continued back and forth, nobody knew what to believe or what they were talking about. All I knew was that sure as hell wasn’t about me…. In fact, I’m sat in the courtroom right now, they’ve been bickering for over an hour now and the Jury, Judge and I are bored – we’re all on our phones and that’s where I’m writing this from…

TL; DR – If you wouldn’t want your lawyer to act this way, why should we accept it from our Politicians?

We're looking to spend ~$1200 a month on a decent place, nothing too fancy. We'd like to be close to the business district for work is possible. I've been told Shady Side is poppin but we'd like to avoid lululemon and khaki clad yuppies. From my limited research, I think Lawrenceville, Bloomfield, Highland Park, and East Liberty might be options. 

Edit: To help give you a better idea of what I'm looking for, my boyfriend and I are very social and active. We really enjoy going to shows and festivals (electronic, blues, hip hop, anything really) at all of the music venues in Chicago and usually go out moderately hard Friday and Saturday. We graduated college last year and will go play darts or meet some friends for trivia during the week. My boyfriend studied architecture and I studying marketing so we like to check out galleries or documentaries occasionally. My boyfriend is looking for an architecture internship in Pittsburgh right meow so our activities may be limited depending on his employment. We're both pretty casual and laid back, so avoiding uppity areas would be nice. I'm also fortunate to be saving on living expenses as I'm moving from Chicago so I'd like something nice, clean, safe, and close to other areas and things to do. 

Edit #2: So it seems as if I'll be visiting this weekend.

During my last year there I got on w/ an internship as an application engineer for a company, and since I had the offer to just keep working there after I graduated I took that opportunity because that the time it was a pretty good deal - made decent money for a recent college grad, and back then the job did not involve a lot of what it evolved into.

I figured I'd just keep the job and try to move more toward a development job which is more of what I was looking for at the time.  Well as time went on I got more and more responsiblities at the job, including 24/7 on-call support, performing code releases, and supporting more and more applications.

The problem was is I lost sight of the goal of becoming a developer because the company never really supported my requests to try and move over into a development role.  On top of that, everything has just... sucked at this company gradually more and more.  The people I work with are awesome, but it's the policies and the way it is ran that have just been eating away at me.

I can't tell you how many god damn nights I've stayed from the morning all the way through 2 AM or so either working on critical issues or performing code releases.  I can't tell you how many god damn weekends I've spent working when I should be out enjoying my life.

Just this week I was woken up 2 hours before I'm normally supposed to come in and work because of the 24/7 page outs, and even today on the weekend yet again I was woken up at 7:30.  I can't fucking stand it anymore.

It'd be different if I was rewarded for any of the tireless work I've put in at this company - everyone I work with says they love working with me and that I do a great job.  Yet I've been here coming up on 6 years now and I've never been given a substantial raise or promotion.  I get new projects and responsibilities put on my plate, but never a pay increase.

One thing that really fucking got to me was a few months back it was the first time I had ever not answered a page-out.  And the reason was because for some reason in my own house my fucking phone wasn't getting service, and I was about an hour to two hours late in answering the issue.  They basically cursed me out and gave me a big written warning that basically said that if it happened again I would be terminated.  So all of this time I do all this great work (I even won the company-wide quarterly award once for excellent service voted on by peers) and I never get recognized for it ever by anyone that would matter (ie people that can give me a raise or promotion) and yet the one time I fuck up they want me gone.  The only reason I probably still got to have my job was that I'm the only one with extensive knowledge in so many areas of our system.

The depression and shitty nights of sleep due to page-outs and the anxiety/stress placed on me by being on-call has made my life a living hell and I can't take it anymore.  This isn't how I ever wanted to live my life.   I'm making shit salary anyway so it's not even remotely worth it to go through this.

My question is if you guys were in my shoes would you quit without lining up another job first?  I ask this because I have had a hell of a time trying to find another job, because I'm trying to get into a job that does not have 24/7 on-call duties, yet still utilizes my skills.  I'm really fucked over because my only job experience is in being an application engineer, not a software developer or software engineer.  And all those application engineer jobs require 24/7 on-call duties, which I don't want ever again.  It's a waste of your fucking life to be on these type of things.  

I can't seem to get anyone interested in me for software development jobs though, I've had a few interviews but I always end up majorly fucking up on one part of the interview and I'm sure that's why I never get offers from those companies.  


I don't really know where to go from here.  I mean I guess I could go back to school... and get a masters?  Seems kinda pointless in this field.  Is this what I'm going to have to do though given my situation?  Or do I need to start my own side project so I have something to show people on my resume?  My problem is I obviously still know how to code, but I'm having a hard time finding interviews when I have no job experience and it's been 6 years since I was in school.

Advice much appreciated on the matter, I don't know much longer I can go on like this to be honest."

I've been interested in programming for a long time, and am currently majoring in ComSci. For the majority of my programming career, I've been told I'm good at programming and regularly gotten good marks and whatnot. However, the further I've progressed down my chosen path of study, the more I realize that knowing how to do stuff in a specific language is nowhere near as important as knowing how to be a good programmer. I *really* want to be a good programmer. Unfortunately, I suffer from a crippling lack of ambition (I play too many vidya), and a woeful inability to not look at what I have to learn in small sections. I recently started a development internship and have been given a ""reading list"" from the guy who seems to have taken the responsibility of mentoring me. I'm reading up on the stuff he's mentioned, and it's interesting, but I feel like a lot of it isn't really sinking in, and am confronted by this gigantic wall of things I don't understand yet, which causes me to shrink away and go back to other, simpler things (I'm up to 600ish points on codeacademy in the space of about a week, currently working on python).

Anyways, that's all just a lot of backstory for a simple question, which is: Where do I start? How do I get involved in the greater programming community, such that I can learn how to be good at what I do, as opposed to just know a lot of languages and be bad at all of them? I know that the key is practice, practice, practice - I'm just afraid that I don't have enough knowledge yet, and that I'd only be reinforcing bad habits.

Thanks in advance :D

tl;dr Where do I go to learn to be a good programmer, as opposed to a good code monkey?"

Also, I don't know anything about quality, that is, what differentiates a good astrolabe from a cheap one.

To help narrow it down I've got an upper price limit of about $100. I would really like a brass one rather than paper, but I don't know how realistic that is given the budget.

It's a four-month internship on the web development team of a large organization.

A week has gone by, and I haven't done much coding yet, but this will change soon. Part of the slowness has been due to difficulties in getting the proper software set up (not exactly the fastest organization), and trying to familiarize myself with the workplace and its technologies. It's my first time using Visual Studio, C#, and ASP.NET.  Prior to this, most of the coding I've done has been with Java and for school - I've just finished up my second year of CS. It's my first time coding professionally, and I've been quite nervous. 
  
Already, I'm feeling overwhelmed here. Some things I'd like to know about:
  
1. What's the best way to ask for help? I have a great supervisor who understands that I'm an intern here to learn, so I know he doesn't expect perfection from me. I mainly follow his direction, but he is very busy. If it makes any sense, I'd like to ask good questions and not feel like I'm annoying him. I know it's a mistake - not getting help when I need it, especially when I need clarification.

2. How can I get better at understanding and reading other people's code? I'm not great at this. I was rather overwhelmed when I saw the code for the project, although I don't know what else I expected. I felt like I was just thrown into a project. I did receive some clarification from the supervisor and another developer, but I think I should be more self-sufficient. 

3. Will I ever begin to feel like I know what I'm doing as time goes on? I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing, except for following the guidance of others.

4. How can I make the most of my internship? Already I feel like I will continue to feel overwhelmed if I don't take an active role here. I know I have a lot of things to learn. Although I'm nervous, I'm excited to actually be coding things that will be used by people.

I'm basically looking at this as I have six months in which I am going to pour most of my free time into searching and applying for jobs across the country before I have to start repaying my student loans. I'm working a minimum wage ($7.25/hr) job right now in which I get tips (I'm a bellman) that I'm saving up in a literal piggy bank. I make about $300-400 (take home pay) every two weeks and I've gotten $300 in tips from 4 slow weeks of work (hospitality industry obviously picks up during summer months).

What suggestions do you have for someone who is trying to make this move from a small town life into a larger (at least 30k population) town to start my adult journey? Is there some kind of rule for how much I should save up based on where I'm wanting to go? The huge ass cities (NY/LA/Miami/etc) are pretty much out of the question. 

I read that Forbes list of the best places for college grads that suggests Dallas, TX (5.9% unemployment, $900 average apartment, $46.2k average income), Houston, TX (6% unemployment, $800 average apartment, $47.5k average income), and Denver, CO (7.4% unemployment, $970 average apartment, $50k average income).

How much can be placed in these types of lists? With those numbers, what should I try to save up before making the big move? Doing something like this, is it reasonable to sell my car to put towards the savings when I'm ready to move and just invest in a bike or scooter or something? I'm really just looking for any kind of advice. Really desperate to make this move and start making things happen for myself and my family who have always lived in this area I'm in right now.

Yet, I look at jobs I want, like a speechwriter, copy writer, or basically anything involved in marketing, and these skills seem to use exactly the skills I hone with my English degree. 

It seems to me like the conventional wisdom regarding English degrees, is just misplaced, and comparing average earnings is a bad measure. Am I just kidding myself? Should I just major in economics?

I'll also be pretty fluent in Russian by graduation, if I major in English, if that helps my job prospects any (I'm guessing it doesn't). Plus I've completed an internship, ostensibly to help to manage a senatorial candidate's social media presence, though, really did very little, and I'm not sure I can use them as a good reference.

So anyway, does anybody have any experience with English majors getting a good job after graduation? Does knowing Russian help in the job market? I'll also have a minor in Philosophy, for what its worth.

I walk into the room and get surprised by my boss, interns, and Department Head with a small cake and flowers. I got the grant money I requested from a federal pot of money for an educational program I want to start in our school district when I was back in DC lobbying a few months ago. I've been working on this for 8 months and I got my full ask and will get to design the program from the ground up and I couldn't be more excited. This is essentially my dream and proves I can do it.   
  
I want to be a lobbyist for educational funding and help decrease the achievement gap and this feels like validation for everyone who told me I couldn't do it. As recently as last month, people questioned my ability and have told me things like you're too pretty to be taken seriously, your heels are too high, your clothes are too bright, etc. They even nicknamed me Washington Barbie when I went back to visit and lobby. I can do what I put my mind to in a pretty dress, full face of makeup, and four inch pumps and sometimes nothing is sweeter than watching prejudiced people eat their words by proving them wrong through nothing more than hard work and dedication.   
  
So the moral here is today I learned that your actions can silence all critics. Never change who you are to achieve a dream and if you work for it, it will come true. The people who questioned me are now asking to have drinks and trying to work with me. Sorry if this is long but this is huge personal victory for me and I wanted to share it with my favorite people. Thank you all for keeping me sane and for reminding me that I am a strong, capable woman who can accomplish anything she sets her mind to. I couldn't do this without you all. &lt;3"

1e7769,1,2013-05-12,Just finished my 5th/Erasmus year in engineering (in the UK). Now what?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1e7769/just_finished_my_5therasmus_year_in_engineering/,"Hi fellow engineers,

I'm a Spanish guy who has just finished his Engineering degree (Industrial Engineering, which in Spain is basically a broader version of Mechanical Engineering). I've been studying this last year in the UK and I just love it in here, so I would like to stay here and try to get a job as an engineer in here.

But life's never easy, so I have some problems with that:

-I would love to work in the automotive sector. Cars are basically the main reason why I've studied engineering in the first place... and I'm afraid that if I apply for a job in, say pressure vessels, I will eventually become ""this engineer specialized in pressure vessels"" and it will be hard for me to move to cars.

-Even if I've finished all of my exams... I'm not technically a graduate yet. Because of the way Erasmus grants work, if you go abroad you cannot do your last year AND your last year project. That is, you can either do all of the 5th year subjects but no project, or do them back in Spain and then go to [insert country here] and finish your project there. Either way your stuck for a 6th year (thanks, bureaucracy). However, some companies might consider me graduate (since I could do the project in just 3 months while working for them) or let me work with them on a project that I can use as a final year thesis.

-And well... I'm Spanish, and I don't know if that's good or bad for applying for a job in here. I know for a fact that engineering is way harder in Spain than in here, but potential employers probably won't know that. My English is quite good anyway (well, you can probably judge for yourselves by reading this) so I shouldn't have any problems with the language if I finally start a career in here.

So here's the question: What do you think I should do? Try to apply for Graduate jobs in here, even if they are not automotive related? Student Internships? Should I go back to Spain, start the final year project, and meanwhile look for jobs in the UK?

Thank you r/engineering!"

I broke up with my boyfriend of two years immediately when I started going to a well known ""party"" school. I got into a lot of risky situations and let people take advantage of me. I joined a church group in hopes of making some lasting connections, and as soon as I dated a girl (I'm bi) the pastor made a public announcement that I would be going to hell. Everywhere I turned, the places I put my trust into backfired on me. The end of it was talking to my advisor about internship. I was an art student who was always top 2 or 3 of my class and won various awards. The school itself had purchased some of my work. When I inquired about where I would go after college, my advisor offered up that it may be a managerial position at Walmart, or something of that nature. I was so angry and lost and confused, I packed all my things and took my small amount of savings and got an apartment in Chicago with a friend of a friend. The girl I lived with became one of my best friends, we did everything together. At the end of the summer, I found out that she had ripped me off the whole time on the rent and pocketed a profit for herself, even. I had been living VERY meagerly to support my lifestyle, living on just around $10 a week. I was so hurt to find out that even she had betrayed me. 
     So in short, in a span of about two years, everyone I ever knew, loved, or trusted managed to screw me over somehow. And that brings me to where I am at and the problem I have now. I am in a way better spot now, I am going to a kick ass culinary school and have secured a summer internship at one of the world's greatest restaurants. I have an apartment in the gold coast area of Chicago. I have a fucking iPhone. All these things I never thought I could achieve, I did. Because of my distrust for people however, I spend a lot of my time alone. I over think. I try to hang out with people but when they start to do anything less than awesome, or even are slightly annoying, I distance myself totally. The last two semesters, I have hardly made any friends. I am quite content to sit by myself in my free time and avoid people. I can tell it isn't healthy for me though. I used to be quite social. Now I am introverted and I feel that I have a hard time trying to function in social settings like parties and bars that used to be very fun for me. How can I get myself out of this funk, and become more open minded about people around me? I would love to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend some day, and I know thats a big step away from how I am now, but I want to know that I could trust someone again enough to let them in. How can I become more outgoing again?"

I do have my identification number for Steuer. I never have paid taxes because I worked as an Au Pair and then recently as an intern for 400€ per month, which I was told was not taxable.

This is someone who I was very close to, growing up. For a while there, he was my father while my mother completed medical school. I tried my best to cheer myself up today. Tried to hang out with my housemate but he doesn't seem interested in that. I wanted to do a household roast dinner to celebrate Mother's Day/Grandfather's Life but I was shot down. All these things today are just bringing me down. I got an email from someone saying they would love to have me intern for them, but all I can do is focus on the negative and I cannot get out of this slump. 

I thought I beat depression. The entirety of 2012 I was on Prozac and fighting numbness and apathy. But starting from last month, that negative voice in my head is back again, obsessing on crap that doesn't matter. Everyone here disappoints me. I feel like it's so hard to find genuine people, the ones I know are back in my hometown. I'm too scared to meet new people. 

I'm an art student and I feel like I'm wasting my time. I can't seem to get inspiration, my art seems to be lacking. I've accepted death as imminent. I'm not suicidal at this stage but death doesn't scare me at all anymore.  Every now and then when I'm crossing the road I wonder if I should just stop in front of a moving car. I'm seeing signs everywhere that I should just get back to seeing my counsellor. I almost feel like doing this will just make me more depressed. 

I feel like I have no one to talk to about this in real life apart from one amazing friend who wants to Skype me from Lebanon. I'm worried they'll think I'm being a drama queen. That, and I'm afraid that if I say anything, they won't care. I feel like I can't open up to my SO about this, he's already commented on how I'm a negative, moody person. I don't feel comfortable talking to him about this. Today I said I thought I should go see a counsellor and he replied with ""no harm in that"". That's all. I don't think he know's how to handle the crazy.

**TL;DR:** I'm a whiny cunt. I'm so sorry for the long post, I just needed to get these things out of me, "

I have recently arrived in Cape Town with a couple other interns, we use Macbooks and are having a horrid time trying to connect our laptops to the PPPoe wireless internet. The house we are staying in has a Billion 800VGT router with service provided from Telkom using ADSL internet. Interns with PCs do not seem to have a problem but our Macbooks seem to be having a difficult time connecting to internet. 

I have managed to get my airport to connect to the IP address of the household, along with ethernet when connected. I have purchased ADSL from Pick N Pay and I have had the PPPoe connect a couple of times on and off, but it still does not establish an internet connection to be able to pull up a webpage

Apparently another intern had bought an airport extreme wireless dock and that worked, but we really do not want to spend $150+ to get one.

Does anybody have any experience with this or advice? Thanks!"

Can't sleep.,Nymics,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1e6d1f/first_post_ever_23_male_just_graduated_college/,"Hello Reddit, 
  First time ever posting but it's 4:45am here and I can't sleep so I thought I'd try to write down some of my thoughts here. Well, here goes. I just graduated from Purdue University. My girlfriend of over two years, 'Sarah', still has one more year left. We have a legit wonderful relationship. We lived together for the last year and a half. We have amazing chemistry. I know its cliche but we understand each other for who we are (the good and the bad) and we both think the world of the other person. I don't know how to state it really except for we had the most caring, loving, fun relationship I have ever seen. (Disclosure: I am not naive or in puppy love. I have had multiple long-term relationships.)
  My relationship with this amazing person ended today. Not because either of us wanted it to end but because of circumstance. She has an internship multiple states away for the summer and I am staying on campus to finish some projects for my job. I'll be gone by the time she comes back for school in August. I plan on moving far away from Indiana because, well it's Indiana and kinda sucks.
  Dropping her off at the airport today was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. We plan to continue being in each other lives as friends but who knows if that will work out. We are both so crazy about each other if any one of us starting dating again, I don't know if we would be able to handle it well enough to continue being friends. 
  Today was weird. I didn't know what to expect to feel when I dropped her off. I fell apart a little bit as I drove away from the airport but I got myself together. When I got back to my apartment, I almost lost it again at the thought of being here without her, but thankfully, I had a friend come over for moral support. We watched Anchorman then met up with another friend at the bars. 3 pitchers later and we make it back to my friends place that's near my place. I am pretty damn drunk at this point but I decide tequila shots are a good idea. So I'm absolutely hammered but oddly enough, I was doing okay. I was missing 'Sarah' but I was keeping it together. I eventually stumble home and decide to microwave a leftover steak but I passed out of my coach for ~2 hours. I woke up surprisingly sober. I ate the steak and checked my phone. 'Sarah' was texting me that she couldn't sleep. We talked on the phone and I could tell she was pretty upset although she was trying to keep it together. We chatted a bit and she said she was feeling better and we got off the phone. I was feeling kinda numb at this point so I played some video games. After, I thought about going to bed but it hit me that for the first time in over a year, she wouldn't be there with me. The realization hit me pretty hard but I wasn't upset...more just numb. I don't know what that means. All I know is that I'm scared of facing going to bed without her. I'm scared of life without her. The crazy thing is I would love to marry 'Sarah' and she would love to marry me. It's just we won't see each other for the next year and then who knows where we will end up. I'm doing a nation wide job search right now and she will be in high demand when she graduates. We both hope that we end up together again but I have no idea what this next year will bring.
  Well guys, I don't know what I expect from this. I just thought maybe writing down some of what i was thinking would help. I guess any advice would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.

1e6b7f,20,2013-05-12,A glimpse at what it is like to work in eSports,fams,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1e6b7f/a_glimpse_at_what_it_is_like_to_work_in_esports/,"**(For the original blog with a couple pics so it flows better and isn't a tl;dr eyesore - follow this: http://www.flash-esports.com/news/view/390)**

Working in eSports has been a topic of interest for a few years now. Many newcomers to the eSports scene often ask how they can become involved and help the industry grow. More often than not, they do not know where to start, nor do they have realistic expectations of what working in eSports often entails. This leaves a bitter taste in their mouths and they leave feeling let down.

I would like to share with you my personal experiences on what I feel it means to actually work in the eSports industry. I have been involved in eSports since 2003 as a fan, and have worked in the industry, in one way or another, since 2006.

Back when I was first introduced to eSports, I followed a number of eSports media outlets. The one that had the most profound impact on me was GGL - Global Gaming League. The GGL was a media outlet that acted as a launching platform for quite a few individuals in eSports today. It was by no means their sole point of origin - but it was where I first came across them, and how I got started on my path to working in eSports. It was also the first glimpse I had of what professional gaming was or could possibly be in the future.

GGL played host to notable personalities such as djWHEAT, Carmac, Mahmood and a number of others who either worked there or freelanced there. I would frequent the site for the eSports news yes, but more for the editorial content that came out. My favourites were by far Carmac and Mahmood. Although I did not always agree with what they wrote, the fact of the matter was, these guys were writing about the people I idolized. And since I enjoyed writing myself, I became their fan in kind.

Eventually GGL would go defunct in eSports and I would move on as well. Fast forward to 2007 and my first gig as a writer. I was, for all intents and purposes, a fanboy. A fanboy of wNv, who at the time, were the best team in China. For those of you who do not know, wNv (wisdom + nerve = victory) was a Chinese team owned and operated by Aigo, a Chinese tech retail company. The team had a team house, and an office. They supported multiple games such as Warcraft 3, Counter-Strike 1.6 and FIFA. The team was sponsored by the likes of Coca-Cola and even had their own shoes. 

I started out at wNv because back in those days we used IRC. Being the fanboy I was, I would frequent their team channel on quakenet and I offered to do anything for them, even be their mascot. They did not have a need for a mascot, but they did need new writers. As a result, they asked if I was interested and if so, that I submit a piece of writing for them to evaluate. I did so and they said I had potential, and I was hired. I was now the volunteer features writer for wNv, my favourite team of all time.

Being a volunteer writer in eSports gives you some pretty interesting opportunities, money just usually is not one of them. For instance, a good friend of mine who was the same age as me (16 at the time) and living in the Netherlands was sent to ESWC for wNv to provide coverage. I myself was able to produce the very first interview with now world renowned Warcraft III player, TH000. 

But still, the hours you are expected to put in are long, and if you want to advance your career and get sent to events and get the good interviews with famous players, and maybe even one day, the chance at getting paid, you had to sacrifice. And I do not mean a couple hours a day. No, you would be expected to give up holidays with your family, many hours every day keeping tabs on news, and then the hours producing your own work. And most of us were in school and avid gamers as well, so your schedule gets sapped pretty quickly if you really want to make an impact.

To give you an example, Easter weekend is a popular date for events. Meaning, if you are one of the people at home providing coverage, your week will look something similar to this: Pre-event interview(s) with prominent players on your team, coverage hub designed/published/updated, event preview written, and the regular scene news throughout the week. If you were smart, you paced this content beforehand and it won't be that big of a deal. But complications happen, and players are often difficult to work with.

Then comes the event weekend, you will work non-stop all weekend except for sleep. If the event is not in your time zone, you need to fix your sleeping pattern. You will update scores, create match reviews, publish and promote video/photo content from the event and do daily recaps. Essentially you sit at your computer with the stream on 24/7 the entire weekend of any event you are meant to cover.

Oh yeah, this is all by yourself too, covering multiple games. If you are lucky, you will have one or two other staff members helping you from home, but often times you end up covering events alone because people just disappear when it comes time to buckle down and get the job done.

That being said, you could manage all of this, but usually something has to give. For me it was a social life. Which really did not matter, because eSports was my social life and it is what I always wanted to do. But not everyone is like this, and through my seven or so years of working in the industry, I have seen many, many kids get hired on as volunteers and leave within the week because they just did not have all of the information. They did not know the time commitment, they did not know how difficult the work actually was, or even that you had legitimate responsibilities. 

That last point is a big one. eSports is not just a past time. It is a job. If you get hired on, even as a volunteer, you are expected to work, attend meetings and be relied upon to meet deadlines and do your job as you would any other job in ""the real world"". It may be video games, and it may be fun, but it is still a job that people take very seriously. But I digress. 

Eventually I would leave wNv for what I thought were greener pastures. They had promised incentives and never delivered (and later there was a lawsuit filed against the team by the Chinese staff members a couple years later) so I went elsewhere.

For years it was volunteer position after volunteer position and a lot of broken promises. Still all the while, I followed people like Carmac who eventually went to SK to become their Editor in Chief and now, as you probably know, works at Turtle Entertainment running IEM. During this time I would work for a number of teams and media outlets, and constantly posted lengthy comments replying to articles by Carmac, Malystryx, _evan and ZECHS. Back in those days Reddit was not what is for eSports today, and TL.net did not have the kind of impact it does either. So commenting on websites like MYMYM or SK-Gaming offered a halfway decent platform to get your name noticed just by commenting regularly. 

Eventually in 2009 as I opted to go back to College, I began working at Fnatic. This was not my first paid gig, but it was my first stable gig. The reason I ended up getting a job at Fnatic was through my years of volunteer work in my late teens. They had seen my articles and interviews and since I knew most of the staff already through previous ventures, I had an in. I was given a two-month trial period, at the end of which if I was successful, I would be paid a monthly salary of $100 USD.  

My first two months were so successful, Fnatic even decided to back pay me for my first two months of service. Awesome. I worked steadily, producing a weekly interview and a weekly column while in College. Eventually, I was given a raise a few months later to $200 a month. During this time I was either at College studying or at home working.

After my first year at Fnatic I was faced with a difficult financial decision, ask for a raise during the summer months to $500 a month, or be forced to find a regular job in order to pay for school and my trip to China. I put together a short proposal of the work I would do during the summer, and while I was on my trip in China, and Fnatic agreed. I was even so lucky that they paid for my trip from Beijing to Shanghai (and my own hotel room for almost a week) in order to cover IEM Shanghai. This was not my first event. It was not even my first event for Fnatic, but it was nice of them to allow me to get more out of my trip to China, as I had no intentions of going to Shanghai during my 1.5 months in the country.

Eventually I would be promoted and I would run Fnatic's social media efforts and help with the editorial team when the regular EIC would be away. Additionally I was offered the opportunity to run MSI's gaming portal as well, increasing my salary to $700 per month. If you work incredibly long hours and prove you are reliable and can produce quality work - opportunities will come. They do not come quickly, and because of an incredibly long history of mistrust, you need to be very consistent, no matter if you are a writer or doing other forms of work. During my last year at Fnatic, I even had the opportunity to do an internship (required by my College) with SteelSeries in China and Hong Kong. (Blog here: http://www.fnatic.com/content/9561)

eSports today is a lot more developed in certain ways than back when I first got involved. The last three years have seen intense growth and a lot of money has been injected into the industry as a whole. As a result, there have been more stable, full time opportunities. That said, the general process of how to get involved and what it actually looks like for the vast majority, is still the same as it was in the past.

Most of the time you will start as a volunteer. You will work terrible hours and you will be asked to sacrifice a lot of your personal time. If you work hard and are consistent, and constantly look for ways to improve your work, whatever it may be, you will probably get opportunities. That is my genuine belief. You will work hard, and a lot of the time you will have to ask for those opportunities, and you will have to work your way up to them, but they are there. My other piece of advice, and I cannot stress this enough - go to school and get a degree of relevance. 

I just want to close this blog by saying, working in eSports is not overly glamorous, but if it is something you are truly passionate about, you will see the glamour when no one else does. eSports is a very interesting phenomenon, and it offers a world of experiences I never would have even dreamed of if I had not followed my gut and pursued eSports with everything I have. If you have questions, I encourage you to ask and I will do my best to answer them.

Have never intentionally gone more than a week without PMO, probably more like 4 days. I have never really gone into extreme stuff, or changed my social life around it, but its always been there. Never really had the motivation to quite. I watched the ted talk and stuff, but I just loved my porn too much and never really had the motivation.

A close friend invited me to a SA meeting, I think because he wanted to include me in on his support group. Incidentally I checked out yourbrainonporn the night before, and finally decided this might be worth it.

I haven't done it 2.5 now, and so far its been okay. Something just snapped in me, and I really wanted to quit. I'm not trying to change anything  else, I'm actually typing this with the lights out alone in my room laying in bed with my laptop. I'm not going for any internet filters, I want to just make the decision not to at all times.

I am a junior in college, and start my summer internship on Monday. I am going to be studying for my actuarial exams, and trying to start a workout and diet regimen at the same time. Maybe all that time spent with PMO I can spend exercising, taking care of my body, and studying more.

I'll try to substitute reading this sub if I have a bad urge, and make posts and save copies to try and somewhat document what goes on.

I have a really good feeling sometime. I have never had the desire or motivation to quit, and now I do. I used to have urges multiple times per day, and now I just let them go. I don't fight them, just let it pass because I want to. I want to quit, I want to be off of it. I want to be all I can be. When the love of my life shows up, I want to be everything I can be. 

Lastly, I need to say I would never have even begun this journey without all of you. This subreddit got me started, the positive stories, the experiences you post. It's because YOU tell me about your experience that I want to do this. I dedicate this to you, my fellow fapstronauts."

From what I've heard from one forum, a minor in stats is not very useful because it doesn't cover enough material to be of much use and that one should major in math or CS and then get a master's degree in statistics, since so little companies hire people with just a bachelor's in statistics.

Any advice would be appreciated.

(Sorry I got side-tracked and am too lazy to delete it) I am attending a decent university ( a competitive science university if you will) as a marine science major and I couldn't excel in the large general science classes (up to 500 students) and i couldn't handle a semester and got a bad grade which brought me down to a 2.1. Within two semesters I have brought it up to a 2.6 (thank you marine science classes), but I applied to nine internships and didn't make any of them. I guess what I am trying to ask is what I should do maybe because I feel like my ADHD is going to make it harder to get a job.

1e67ai,7,2013-05-12,Just venting.,Tua26982,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1e67ai/just_venting/,"Throwaway account. Just need to get this off my chest and unsure who to talk to. 

I got a chance to catch up with my dad today. I haven't really seen him much after my teen years and I never really cared about that, to be honest. I was already old enough that I relied on my friends more than a father figure. Sure, I had to google how to shave after accidentally nipping myself like an asshole so many times and do other things I assumed would have been taught by a father but I never thought of it. 

Today, he came and visited me at my grad school. He lives in another country and was visiting our hometown which is almost 1000k miles away from where I currently am. He attempted previously to meet me and I agreed in a heart beat. Twice, he bought tickets to come down to see me, but usually after i thought about it, I would withdraw my agreement. I'm in the midst of finals and I need to start my internship which is another 1000 Miles drive from where I'm currently located (2k from my hometown) as soon as my last exam is done. I don't even know what compelled me to agree with him when he asked to visit me. 

Nevertheless, today, he came down to see me by taking a flight down here and then taking a 2 hour bus ride to see me. The original plan was for us to just hang out for 45m during my lunch break from studying. Honestly, I didn't really care for seeing him so if he wanted to see me so bad, fine, whatever. I'll take a quick break from studying. 

But, he missed the bus and ended up just taking a cab up here, instead. I'm irritated by that point because I kind of feel bad. He's going through all this trouble for what I assumed was going to be an attempt to bond after only being in contact with me intermittently in the past 12 years. I'm a grown ass man in my mid-20s, I really don't need to have those father-son moment. I'm too old and too jaded to give a shit. I have more important things  right now to consider- my exams and work. 

But then he came up and for some reason, my mind went from ""I don't give a fuck, just don't take up too much time"" to ""OMG! My Dad's visiting me!! OH SHIT!"" Like, internally, I felt like how I felt when I was a kid trying to show my dad my new bike tricks. Instead of just grabbing coffee like I planned, I ended up dragging him into my car because I wanted to show him that I learned to drive stick recently (to which he commented "" I see you're still not good at it, but fuck it, dude can't even drive stick!). Then, I aimlessly drove around my campus and started pointing out landmarks to him (Yeah, that's my biking trail! And that building there? Yeah, I lived there last semester! Oh! Let me show you our football stadium!). 

Even after parking, I deliberately took the long way through campus to get to my favorite restaurant because I wanted to show him where my classes were. I even fucking pointed to the windows in the library that I look out of when I'm taking my study breaks (I don't even know why I pointed at that). While at the restaurant, the waitress that always serves me was there and I was tempted to introduce him to her just because I wanted to say ""this is my dad! he came to visit me!"".
Even after we finished eating and I took him to his bus stop, I insisted on waiting with him. Hell, I even sat there and showed him the stuff I was studying because I was trying to show him that I grew up from the high school kid that failed 9th grade and was repeatedly suspended from school. He was actually interested in what I was studying and was impressed by the subject matter. I'm extremely embarrassed to admit it but I felt really proud right then. 

Like, he left 10 hours ago and is probably on the plane now to go back to his home. And, I'm actually really sad that he left. I haven't felt the urge to cry in over... well, 12 years now. Nothing ever makes me sad. I'm usually very stoic when it comes to my feelings. Nothing makes me happy, nothing makes me sad. Just... neutral. But as soon as I came home, I just felt nauseous and slightly light-headed. I thought I ate something bad but then it occurred to me that I was just, well, sad. I've always hated feeling emotional because it's inconvenient. 

But here I am. It's 2AM I haven't gotten any studying done for my exam on Monday nor did I pack to leave later that night. And here I am, I'm just really sad. He gave me a hug before he left today and I didn't hug him back since.. well, I never hugged my dad before and it felt weird. But I kind of wish I did. To make up for it, I decided to accept an internship with a company in his home country that was extended to me recently as that would lead to getting a full time offer there after I complete school.   

Just.. had to get that off my chest. Thanks!

1e6511,0,2013-05-12,Hypotheticals,agentsoapbox,LSAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/1e6511/hypotheticals/,"Let's assume that my Stats are 3.2 GPA and 175 LSAT. A splitter obviously and an extreme one at that. 

with those stats, it's possible I can get into my dream school of Georgetown, though barely. They would have to overlook my GPA which is well below their 25% and really take a chance on me. I doubt they would give me much financial aid. 

Hofstra on the other hand, would probably accept me and even possibly give me a full ride with stats like that. My GPA would be within their range (though low) but my LSAT would be so far above their 75% that I would be highly sought after by Hofstra. 

so here's the question:

should I shell out the money to go to a prestigious t14 who may reluctantly accept me

or should I go to a mediocre but respectable law school that may give me a full ride. 

some pluses for Hofstra:

I could do a joint MBA/JD at Hofstra and they would be willing to bypas GMAT and just accept me into their MBA program if I can get into their law school. 

they also have a pretty good LGBT fellowship that would allow me to intern over my summers on LGBT rights advocacy.

Obvious Gtown benefits is that it's just about a golden ticket to practice law anywhere in the country, I would be networking with the future leaders of the law world, I'd be fulfilling a lifelong dream. But then again, I'd have shackles around my ankles with debt. But the payoff might be higher

then again, I might be the top 10% at Hofstra, but probably just around 40% at Georgetown? 

what would you do?"

I'm 21 and male attending college, she's 19 and female, living at home and working. There's more details to the breakup in my previous posts in r/LDR, which I'll list at the bottom.

I broke things off about mid-March, I'd realized I wasn't too happy with the relationship. I felt like we were on very different levels when it came to our ambitions and motivations. It wasn't an easy choice, I still love her very much and probably will for a very long time, but it was a necessary decision. I found our recently that she's already moved on to another relationship, which I won't lie, stung slightly. It's only now I've worked up the nerve to start deleting photos, videos, and the other various post-breakup chores that come up. 

The problem I've seen arising now is that I don't know how to process all this and which step to take first... I've thought about trying to date other people, even just casually, but I can't seem to work up the nerve to even speak to a woman with anything more than a professionally polite tone. School's over for now, I'm going on an internship in June and it lasts 6 months, so I'll be home for quite awhile. I feel like a lot of old confidence issues I've had are resurfacing; self-doubt, poor self image (physically and emotionally), my sleeping pattern is screwed up... I feel like a mess again. 

I apologize if I sound like I'm whining, I'm just not sure how to handle this. Any advice you can offer would be a great help, and thanks for reading.

I had an amazing summer last year - I lived alone in a subletted house, had a 9-5 internship, and cooked all my food. I lost about 20 pounds, had so much fun, and felt so healthy. I really tried to eat well when I went back to college, but it was so hard to eat less when I was around friends. I gained *more* weight back this year than I'd lost and now I'm really scared about the direction it's going. I'm feel like I can only control what I eat when I cook it, and if someone else makes it (the college dining hall or my mom) then I can't resist eating it and I can't count the calories. I'm eating like a crazy person and always have so many helping and ice cream etc. 

I know I can do it well if I'm alone, but I have so much anxiety about living with other people and dealing with food. I like living with friends, but I would way rather live alone and control what I buy and eat. Is this normal? I just realized that I'm going on vacation with my boyfriend for a week and I am resenting it solely because i'm scared how much I will eat. I would love to spend this summer getting healthy again, but I'm living with people and I just have no idea how I can deal with it.

Wikipedia can store more knowledge than your brain. Computers can calculate way quicker than you do. Google Maps can find the quickest route way faster than you do. 

But we, humans, certainly have our strengths. We are amazing in pattern recognition, for example. But if we can 'give' those 'last human-only skills' to computers, they will quickly become much more 'intelligent' than normal human brains. 

&gt;How could an AI surpass human abilities? Let us count the ways...

&gt;* Speed. Our axons carry signals at seventy-five meters per second or slower. A machine can pass signals along about four million times more quickly.


&gt;* Computational resources. The brain’s size and neuron count are constrained by skull size, metabolism, and other factors. AIs could be built on the scale of buildings or cities or larger. When we can make circuits no smaller, we can just add more of them.

&gt;* Introspective access/editability. We humans have almost no introspective access to our cognitive algorithms, and cannot easily edit and improve them. Machines can already do this (see EURISKO and metaheuristics). A limited hack like the method of loci greatly improves human memory; machines can do this kind of thing in spades.

&gt;* Serial depth. The human brain can’t rapidly perform any computation that requires more than one hundred sequential steps; thus, it relies on massively parallel computation.2 More is possible when both parallel and deep serial computations can be performed.

&gt;Consider how far machines have surpassed our abilities at arithmetic, or how far they will surpass our abilities at chess or driving in another twenty years. There is no reason in principle why machines could not surpass our abilities at technology design or general reasoning by a similar margin. The human level is a minor pit stop on the way to the highest level of intelligence allowed by physics, and [there is plenty of room above us.](http://intelligenceexplosion.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/scale_of_intelligence.png)

&gt;http://intelligenceexplosion.com/2011/plenty-of-room-above-us/

We humans have to study and train for years before we can enter a profession. At this moment, we cannot 'copy' the training a surgeon has received from his brain and paste it in the brain of another human. We still have to use lectures and books and internships, but these are completely inefficient compared to 'copy-paste'. 

In the past, monks had to manually write new Bibles, making Bibles very expensive and rare, just like all other books. Nowadays, we can copy-paste the Bible within a second. They are now available for free on the internet. This is some kind of 'information explosion', and I think the same will happen to intelligence. When we 'decode' intelligence by simulating one brain, we can easily copy it to other (super)computers. It will be able to combine the best traits of computers and humans and it can spread rapidly.

So, I only intended to post one dream here but y'all are so helpful and comforting I figured I'd keep posting to deal with all this rolling around in my brain. My 'normal' dreams don't mess me up quite as bad as the first dream I posted about with this account but they are still moderately disturbing to me. 


I've kept a dream journal in the past to help deal with incredibly strange and vivid dreams. I've been able to sleep without remembering my dreams for a few years now, but I am starting to remember my dreams a couple of nights a week so I figured I'd share my dream journal entries with you lovely fellow Redditors. 


Last night I remembered three of my dreams. One of which I'm not sure where it happened in relation to the other two so I'll put it first. 





**Dream #1**
I felt like I was watching a group of human forest dwellers who were trying to defend their tree fort-esque residences from some rather large assailants. There were three halfling/hobbit type figures, one of which my point of view seemed to follow. I followed one of the halflings through a series of vine and rope traps set up to catch larger enemies and ended up sliding down a hill covered in trees in vines that ended at a cliff with a low stone wall about 3 feet high. 

The halfling slid up to the bottom of the wall and laid there as a giant peered over the wall looking for the halfling I think. I remember feeling worried that the giant could see the halfling because for a moment I was looking over the wall from the halfing's point of view and could clearly see the upper half of the giant. For some reason the giant could not see the halfling and then began pulling rocks off the cliff face and lobbing them into the center of the forest. 

The next part was very hazy but the halfling engaged the giant in some kind of amiable conversation and the giant joined the halfling in some other journey that left the forest (and the battle) far behind. I don't remember anything beyond that. 





**Dream #2**
I was working in an office setting. My point of view was myself. I met two interns who had just arrived for their first day of work. (One of the interns was a new girl who actually had just been hired on Friday of last week for our firm so that's how her face appeared in my dream) The next thing I know I wake up in my ideal bedroom. Morning sunlight is streaming in from a large window on my left with gauzy white curtains that filter the light. I'm in a large bed with white sheets and a puffy white comforter. For some reason, one of the interns is waking up in bed next to me (the one I know in real life). She starts talking about how she wants to play with the snake. This all makes sense to dream-me because I knew there was a snake in the bed with both of us. I lift part of the covers up and freeze. She's digging through the covers looking for the snake and I tell her to stop.

When I lifted the covers I found a VERY large red and white python curled up at the foot of the bed and I am nearly petrified when it starts moving. The snake looks like [this!](http://www.artfire.com/uploads/product/1/811/60811/3160811/3160811/large/snake_mug_0006_original_hand_sculpt_and_hand_paint_red_and_white_snake_b9758154.jpg) except it is about 6-8 feet long and maybe 3 inches in diameter at the thickest point. The snake is laying on our legs with the topsheet between our legs and the snake. It glides off the bed and into the hallway. I chase after it to make sure I know where it is and to prevent anyone else from getting hurt by it. 

I tell the intern to run for help while I follow the snake into another bedroom down the hall. I lose sight of the snake and enter the bedroom. There are two doorways on my left for most likely a bathroom and a closet and a large bed on my right. I walk forward into the room slowly and all of a sudden the python comes swinging out of the second doorway, jaws wide open and aimed for my neck. I lean back just in time, but the python's teeth graze my neck before snapping shut and retreating back to the closet (I assume). I'm freaked out at this point and start piling up books and clothes to form a barrier across the middle of the room to try and keep the snake contained. (In retrospect, the barrier was about a foot high and wouldn't have done jack to keep the snake at bay.) My youngest brother arrives behind me and I tell him the situation. He walks casually into the room and the snake lunges the same way at him from the closet. He catches it with his hands and it begins to curl around his hands biting him repeatedly. The snake at this point morphs from a python into a cobra (still red and white) and my brother manages to peel it off his arms and throws it back into the closet. 

He walks over and shows me his hands and arms and I can see tiny bite marks all over. I am freaking out at this point and start yelling for my 16 year old sister to come take my brother to the hospital. My brother walks away and I am left by myself in the room still screaming for my sister. I yell and yell and yell, and nothing happens. 

I wake up sweating buckets with my heart racing. I stare at my ceiling for about twenty minutes to calm down and get up for some water (my throat feels incredibly dry and scratchy as if I had really been yelling) and go back to sleep. 





**Dream #3**
I'm at some weird party where everything is white. The floor, the ceiling, the tables with exquisite tiny pastries and hors d'oeuvres of various pastel colors. I'm wandering around and trying some when my point of view begins to jump from person to person. Each person eats some unidentifiable food (to me at least) and then starts to bleed, or have strange pains. After 3-4 people jumping I return to what I consider to be ""me."" I take a bite of a pale green doughy looking rectangular food with the consistency of a red bean pastry like Daifuku.

A few seconds later I get a nosebleed. Some snooty woman comes up and makes some ugly comments to me while shooing me to the bathroom. All I can think about is avoiding dripping blood onto the fancy scarf I'm wearing. (I do love my scarves irl) In the bathroom my nosebleed turns into a full blown gusher, blood pours out of my nose in a steady stream. There are several girls there with similar ailments and the bathroom morphs into some shady looking hospital/warehouse. The trashcan that sits in a recessed wall from the bathroom is still present in the new morphed setting and I'm still frantically grabbing paper towels from it to staunch my bleeding. 

All of a sudden this young teenage boy appears. He’s wearing white loose clothing, like a linen shirt and drawstring pants. He snaps his fingers and my nosebleed stops. He begins to talk with zero emotion in his face. I can’t remember what he said but I remember feeling dread that he could control everyone’s ailments including my bleeding. The next thing I know I’m looking through a dirty window in the warehouse into another room. I have a bunch of IVs hooked up in my arms and I’m not sure if stuff is going into me or blood is going out of me. I see the boy in the other room doing something to a girl lying in a hospital bed with a ton of needles in her arms as well. 

I rip the needles out of my arm and as I do so, I realize that my IV cords are connected through the ceiling to the girl in the other room. I grab all the tubing in one bunch and pull down as hard as I can. There are so many needles in the girl that it lifts her straight off the bed. She’s hanging from the cords limp and lifeless. The boy goes ballistic and moves through the wall into the room I’m standing in and hovers over the ground yelling in rage at me. 

At this point, a group of other people bust into my room and somehow startle the boy into leaving the room. The next thing I know we’re all racing to find a way out of the warehouse and destroying whatever we can in the process. On the way out, we overturn a giant metal container that was full of diesel fuel (no clue how I knew it was diesel). The fuel goes everywhere and we try to keep ahead of the fuel wave. Eventually we make it outside and we appear to be in the center of a Zoo. The Zoo is set up in a circular pattern, with a viewing area at the center of the circle. The habitats ground level slopes up the farther it is away from the viewing area. The habitats are falling apart as we come out of the warehouse. The arctic habitat is melting and waves of water are rushing down the hill and the diesel fuel is still rushing closer behind us. The only habitat that seems to be still intact is a desert habitat. We climb the slope with all the animals from the other habitats and manage to reach the top of the habitat which reveals that the entire zoo/warehouse was actually a sloping hole from the normal level of the surrounding ground. 

Things got a little hazier from there, but I had some cool interactions with dolphins in the dry desert (weird right?) and I don’t remember anything else. 





Naturally I was completely exhausted by the time my alarm went off at 6 a.m. I am going to do a serious workout at the gym tonight so hopefully I won’t remember any of my dreams. Physical exhaustion always seemed to help in the past. Otherwise I’ll end up with more crazy dreams and no rest for the workday. In the meantime, enjoy my fucked up subconscious Reddit!


Feel free to try and take a stab at the meanings of these dreams. My brain is limited to my own experiences and perspectives so any alternative views are greatly appreciated!


**TL;DR: 3 crazy dreams, not sure how to summarize so many details. Any explanations/opinions are very much welcomed.**

I got rejected as a transfer applicant from a lot of schools.

However, I attend a top 15 school, and I'm in a really good program – I'm just not happy. I took the semester off to do an internship, and I realized how much more I like being in a small community...my school is huge. 

Unfortunately, transfer acceptance rates are apparently not very high among the top 50 schools, so I've been rejected from everywhere so far. I still have about three schools left to hear from, but I am not holding out much hope.

Anyway, I left my old school in kind of a mess – I still have friends and I have already registered for classes next year, and I have a definite idea of what I want to now do with my liberal arts (humanities, actually, and rhetoric and writing) degree. Still, I can't help but feel rejected and upset, though I know the odds were just stacked sky-high against me. I'm not a minority nor have I cured cancer (just kidding on the first part – more making fun of all of those stories I see about little-itty-bitty white girls who ran track complain about how their 4.0 wasn't enough. Bitches. Suck it up. I'm white, and I did pretty well the first time around...but a cure for cancer seems to be the only way to get into schools nowadays... ;) ...)

I'm grateful for the school I'm in, ya know? It's definitely not community college, and anyway, I still have a few letters (read: rejections) to get. But .... even though I know all of this, I can't *help* but feel disheartened. I never eat junk food, and I had a whole cup of ice cream (a lot for me) with toppings...so I have a stomachache on top of it. 

How much does the college you go to matter? Honestly? Should I trade out my highly-ranked school for a smaller one just for a better experience? 

I'm not going to have a terrible one at the first, but some people now think that I'm a total freak (mental breakdown, then I went to California and am working for ––– to cool off). It's a big school, and why should I care what people think about me? I know me and my life! Okay, anyway, bottom line:

For a lot of reasons, I want to know how your college experience and college reputation has affected your life. Thank you.

Now I'm going to go watch *Anastasia.* "
1e9qwp,2,2013-05-13,Looking for advice on how I (20f) can help my boyfriend (23m) deal with stress from work.,throwawaykyra,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1e9qwp/looking_for_advice_on_how_i_20f_can_help_my/,"My boyfriend (23m) of 18 months has a very demanding job. He gets to work at 9 AM or earlier every day and is often at the office until 9 PM or later. It's not unusual for him to be at work until past midnight multiple nights per week. He's also expected to put in significant hours on weekends. I can't remember a single day in the past several weeks that he has not been at work for at least a few hours. On top of his schedule, he's also unhappy at work due to a difficult relationship with his boss and stress about keeping up with other employees his age.

Due to his hectic schedule, I don't get to see him as often as I'd like. When I do see him once or twice a week, he's almost always too tired to do anything beyond order take-out, watch TV, and have sex. A very large portion of what we discuss (both via text messages on days we don't see each other and also in person when we're together) centers on his struggles at work, his office life, and how tired and stressed he is. I don't blame him for this at all; I know that if I were in his situation, I would feel the same way. 

Unfortunately, it's gotten to the point where his job is consuming our relationship. How do you talk to someone who has no time to pursue hobbies or interests? How do you talk to someone about their day when their entire day revolves around work, 365 days a year?

Even though I don't resent him for this, I don't want his job to detract from our relationship. I'm (20f) a college student; while I'm ambitious (I juggle a busy schedule and I've held four internships at high-profile companies in the field I want to work in after graduation), my lifestyle is also much different than his. I love to go out on the weekends to parties, bars, clubs, museums, plays, etc. While I'm by no means relying on my boyfriend to do these things with me - I have an active social life and share my interests with friends - it's somewhat frustrating that I can't also do these things with my boyfriend. In the past two months, I can remember going out with him exactly twice; one of the occasions was for my birthday. 

We've gotten into a routine of meeting up at his apartment after he finishes work and I finish class. Sometimes, we'll eat separately; other times, we'll do take-out at his apartment. We'll watch TV for a bit, have sex, and then go to bed by 11 pm. In the morning, he rushes off to work and I rush off to class. 

I suppose I have two questions here: 

1. How can I simultaneously support my boyfriend's stress from work while also preventing our relationship from becoming entirely about his job? 

2. Am I wrong for wanting to spend more time with him outside his apartment, engaging in fun activities? I love hanging out at his apartment together, but I need a little variety. How can I incorporate this while still being respectful of his energy levels?

**TL;DR: My boyfriend works long hours seven days a week. I feel like our relationship revolves entirely around his job and he's often too tired to do anything besides watch TV when I see him. How can I fix this while still being understanding and supportive?**"

I was able to complete a Liberal Arts degree within my two first years at my University (not me bragging..moreso a testament to how easy my major was). I've always had an interest in business and money and I'm ready for a big boy major now.. So I am trying to decide between Finance or Accounting. My cousin is an accountant for a major firm and is somewhat influencing me to take up Accounting. This summer I am taking Financial Accounting and then in the Fall I am taking Managerial Accounting and Quantitative Business Tools I (Not sure what it is called at most Universities) and then I will be in the Business School the following spring. 

I am OK in math and pretty good at conceptualizing business and economic concepts in my head. I would say though that my biggest strength is probably my Work Ethic. I'm really willing to put in the time to practice and study to get to where I need to be. 

If you could go back in time and give yourself some Accounting advice in regards to study habits, internships, online resources, concepts, certain courses, etc. what would you say?

I got an internship offer on the spot last month for a job that was unrelated to my major.  I needed time to think about it because of another interview for a real estate position (didn't tell them that, of course).  I moved that next one up, and while it went well, I learned late that it would have required me to work my shitty car into the ground (2+ hrs of travel a day!).  I couldn't accept.  The first position ignored my acceptance after this six-day period, and I was stuck...

Until this week.  Two interviews, one tomorrow, one Thursday.   Similar pay, both small companies, full-time for the summer, and more relevant positions than before.  The one tomorrow costs $800 more in travel expenses, but is half the distance of that real estate job. It wouldn't kill my car I don't think, and I could take the bus for July/August.  The one Thursday is extremely close, and I think I have a great shot at it as well.

If I get an offer on the spot from the first, should I accept it? I don't necessarily have backup transportation to get there, though; if my car died, I would make next-to-nothing with added travel expenses.  Is it okay to let them know that I'll get back to them Friday or early next week? Is the market so horrible that I should take what I can get in the name of experience? Help me out!"

I tend to think a lot, especially when i see someone i might like.

I go to school for my bachelor's degree by bus and train, and on the bus to the train station i sometimes see a guy who catches my attention. I have no idea who he is, but i think i might like him. I'm afraid to say hi, for some stupid reason, but i do like to daydream about possible conversations i might have with him. I basically make myself fall in love with him without actually knowing him. 

Last week I got off the bus in my hometown, and he rode past me on his bicycle. He looked at me in a way i have dreamt about, and when i looked around before crossing the road, i saw him looking behind him, straight at me. Now I'm really excited and I want to know if i have a good chance of getting to know him if i do conquer my shyness and just say hi. I'm so afraid of what might happen!

(I've asked the same thing in /r/askmen, but i'm not really satisfied with the answers i got there...)

tl;dr: I think too much. How do i fix this?

EDIT: Thanks ladies for all the advice! Haven't gotten a chance to follow it, because i haven't seen him today... I hope tomorrow's the day! I'll keep you updated ;)

EDIT2: Still no sign... Starting to think he either quit his studies or he has an internship somewhere else. Or his classes are at very different times than mine. Let's just hope it's the last :P

My girlfriend and I have been dating for over half a year, but the last month or so has been really rocky.

She often tries to make me sound like a bad boyfriend by taking something small I've said and blow it up and proceeds to play the martyr card. No matter how many times I tell her that she's being unfair, or twisting my words around into things that aren't what I said, she cries until I apologize and continues to bring up how she cries over me in later arguments.

For an example, just this morning when we woke up late (we were at her place) we talked about what we were both doing today, I basically said I'd be studying and working on projects all day (it is finals week), and she hinted that she wanted to have morning sex. I told her no because I just wanted to go home and get started with my day since we already woke up later than expected and I have to get things done. She completely shut down on me and just started throwing a fit (for lack of better term) saying that ""I don't ever time for her"" and that I am constantly ""too busy for her."" Keep in mind, we had sex last night, I stayed over her place and are planning to go to dinner together tonight. So I had to tell her that it is not true, that's not what I said and that she's being unfair especially because it's finals week and I want to finish this semester off strongly. She continued to cry and twist my words around until after about 45 minutes she calmed down after the numerous times I told her how it is unfair for her to cry over this, and that just because I didn't want to have sex in the morning doesn't mean ""I'm too busy for her.""

I don't see how this is a healthy relationship anymore. These type of occurrences are happening more frequently. Although I can't say they are all her fault, I have not been a perfect boyfriend either. She has been upset with me a few times for me getting too drunk (to the point where I just pass out in my bed), or where I don't console her enough when she gets upset over other things that happen to her (friend problems, school problems, work problems etc).

Things were never like this previously, but I think the stress of her not seeing me all summer is really getting to her and it is messing with the way she interacts with me.

I am very worried about how she's going to handle herself over the summer, and I don't want to spend the majority of my time when I'm across the country just consoling her via text, phone, skype; that just seems like a huge waste for the both of us. I want to enjoy my time out there, and I want her to enjoy her summer as well.

tl;dr - I am moving across the country for the summer and won't see my gf at all for almost 4 months. Our relationship has been good up until the past month or so, and I am afraid it will only get worse when I move. What do I do?"

I really liked the idea of a weekly, or excuse me, *biweekly* recap of our clan. Here you will find statistics, information, and a general overview of what has happened the past two weeks in Omicron.

**General Information on Reddit Omicron**

While Omicron is the second newest Reddit clan, started almost exactly two weeks ago, we have grown strong, and pretty quickly too. We have some basic rules that, if you would like to join, you need to comply with. 
1. Know the Password

**The Omicron staff happenings**

Since we just started this week, we had a ton of new elders (all of them in fact)! The system I use for hiring elders is a Trial-Run system, which I like to call ""Interning"". I used a form I made on Google Docs to set up applications, where anyone in the clan can apply, and the results will be pasted into a spreadsheet. As of late, I have all the Elders I want, so the forms are closed, but that does not mean people can no longer earn Elder. Right now, we have 6 Elders, with 3 of them interning. They are,
1. *Lshea117

I was in a top 10 school for engineering. I was placed on academic probation last semester for getting two Fs, 1 D, 2 Cs (I think). Next semester I was doing great until a week or two after spring break when I lost all motivation and couldn't do anything, I might have been able to pass all but one of my classes until that point. I decided to stop trying in three classes I knew I would fail. My final grades were 3 Fs, 1 C, and 1 A. I was dropped from the university and am really struggling on what to do. 

I want to change my major into business because I was putting a ton of effort into my classes before spring break and was still doing much worse than the class average and it wasn't worth it. But there is so much to do in order to apply for readmission and I am really scared and stressed about telling my parents. Money isn't an issue, but I feel like the lowest person because I wasted $80,000 of my parents money (over two years on a degree I cannot earn). I signed up for summer classes in engineering at a local community college because I was too scared to tell my parents before I registered.

Edit: I forgot about me trying to get an internship. The engineering firm needed to get in contact with the school and set it up with them (for legal reasons I don't know why). Once I told them to contact the school on Thursday of last week I haven't heard from them. Probably didn't get the internship and they are letting me know by not telling me. 

I really want to go back to my school, it has a good business program as well and I love the college. If I didn't want to go back, this wouldn't be that huge of a problem for me. "

1e9bkv,18,2013-05-13,"I'm a college student used to living well, but now have to live frugally. Any tips?",sparklypiggy,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1e9bkv/im_a_college_student_used_to_living_well_but_now/,"Hi r/frugal!

I've been subscribed to this sub for awhile, and I love it. But now comes the time when I actually need it. This may be a bit long.

I'm used to living on $200/month from my parents, plus $100/month from my savings from my summer job. Unfortunately, both of my parents have hit bad financial patches: my mom is unemployed until August, having previously earned $200k/year and currently living with my two siblings on savings, and my dad is going through his second divorce, having previous provided $400/month (which I put half of into savings). This has been the situation since January.

Since then, my savings from summer work and from what I've put aside from my dad have dried up. I currently have $60 in my bank account. I have a month left until I go home, and 3 weeks after that before I begin my summer internship, which pays $4k for 10 weeks. (Most of that money is going to rent for next year, student loans, living expenses during the 10 weeks, and I'm hoping for about $2k in savings.) I'm in housing and on a meal plan (although the closest dining hall is 20 minutes away), so survival isn't a problem, just quality of life.

I currently work 2 jobs. One of them pays in housing credit, the other is a volunteer position necessary for my career. I'm juggling a full class load as well at a very, very difficult (and expensive) university. I don't have time to pick up a third job, and I doubt anyone would hire me for a month. There are a few opportunities around campus to earn a little cash. Psych studies pay $10/hr and I can probably pick up $30 from that in the next month. Otherwise, I have no income.

I've tracked my spending all year, and find most of my expenses come from transportation, food, and fun stuff. Transportation shouldn't be as much of an issue, as my boyfriend who lives uptown is gone, and I can get to campus for free with my student ID. Food is tough because the dining hall is so far away, so I tend to buy groceries for late night and snacks. Fun stuff... I can get by in the next month without it, I have some previously purchased video games I need to beat.

My question, then, is for the present and the future. My lifestyle is going to be very different not only for this month, but also for the next year until my parents are back on their feet. I need tips to change my attitude towards spending and needs in general. I've applied for financial aid for next year, but I don't have a decision yet, which means I could be living like this (less than $100/month) for a long time.

tl;dr: College kid used to $300/month down to $60 for the next 7 weeks, with a need for frugal living for the next year. Any tips on changing my attitude and spending habits?"

He came in partway through the year to fill a vacancy we had, and before him our bathroom and hallway was perfectly clean. We had a schedule and everything! Now it's filthy. He leaves trash EVERYWHERE. He keeps his laundry outside in the hallway; what, you can't fucking find space in your room? OH, that's right, you have bottles and a FUCKING MATTRESS IN THERE for all of your friends (male AND female) that you bring over every single fucking night, so OBVIOUSLY there's not enough room in there for your shit! GET A FUCKING GARBAGE CAN. Get your bazillion shampoo bottles out of the shower, stop leaving the floor sopping wet, and stop leaving your clothes lying around in there! You take up all of the space on the counter with your shit and leave your trash under the sink! Why the fuck am I supposed to clean up his shit just because it's a shared space? On top of all of this, it's incredibly awkward to talk to him, and he is the the most boring and fake person I've met. He dressed up in business suits and is a complete sycophant, and yet has an *incredibly* filthy private life. He got an internship at the place where I applied for one, and I didn't get one. I resent him for it, SO MUCH. How does a filthy pig like him get it? Apparently he's good at illusions. 

I hate the housing here. The lights are ""eco-friendly"" and turn off randomly all the time, so we had to put tape over the sensor. I hate the fire alarms that go off because idiots in the other building linked to ours don't know how to fucking cook! It's went off ALMOST EVERY SINGLE WEEK. Since I live on the second floor, why can't you build a door for students like me to swipe in between the elevator room and the stairwell? It's WAY more convenient, and it maintains security because you have to swipe into the elevator room and then the stairwell. The people on my floor are boring as fuck, the building is far away from everything, and all of that coupled with my stupid suitemate is just too much.

Speaking of that internship, once I got rejected I had to switch to summer housing and got put into a double despite having requested a single. This is after the housing department had accepted my deposit for intern housing to count towards summer school housing when they switched me, which I had paid ON THE DAY OF THE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATION'S OPENING. Somehow payments transfer but priority for rooms DOESN'T? I know where your motives lie, housing department! On top of that my new roommate looks boring and pretentious as hell, which I wouldn't mind so much if I didn't know him and knew that I had to LIVE with this guy.

I'm so mad."
1e95kv,8,2013-05-13,We had our first talk about maybe breaking up the other day.. I am so in need of advice ;~;,[deleted],wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/1e95kv/we_had_our_first_talk_about_maybe_breaking_up_the/,"This distance thing is really, really hard. Right now we're at a point where due to his super busy schedule, we have to really struggle to find time to spend together. We haven't had any in the past few days (besides yesterday, which doesn't really count), not for lack of trying, but just that once he gets home and gets on Skype his energy is so low and he is so exhausted that I feel bad keeping him up further and tell him to go to sleep. It's getting to the point where a lot of my day is spent waiting for him to get home because his schedule is so crazy that there is literally only an hour or two of an open window when he will be free, and if I don't try to meet him at that time, we'll never have any time for us.  

In a few weeks I start my summer internship and it's going to get crazy busy on my end as well. We fear that there will be 0 overlap between our free times, with the exception of sporadic texts throughout the day, solid time to hang out maybe once every 1-2 weekends, and 1 potential visit (would be our first).  

Which leads to our conversation yesterday. He said he would be home by 9pm my time so we could chat, and I ended up waiting at my computer until 1:30am when he finally got home. We talked about how it isn't okay to keep me waiting like that, and how it really hurts me, and he was so apologetic and kept saying how he felt like a horrible boyfriend who wasn't treating me right. He said he felt like he was wasting my time, and wasn't making me happy. And we talked about maybe how our schedules just wouldn't make this work. And that maybe it isn't worth the struggle to keep trying.  

He kind of put the decision on me. As in, ""You're the one who's really hurt right now, so it's your decision."" Like... is it wrong of me to have wanted him to be selfish and say that he likes me and wants me to reconsider and that he can't make promises about changing his schedule but hell be damned if he isn't going to at least try. When he just gave me that burden all on me, I know in his mind he was thinking ""I'm not good enough for you and I hate how much I'm hurting you right now, so if you don't want this anymore, I understand"" but in my mind it just felt like.. ""I don't care either way. Do what you want,"" as if he's not invested. 

I don't know. I am so confused. I have no idea what I want to do here. On the one hand I like this guy so so so fucking much. On the other, it really does cause me a lot of pain. Maybe it's just because I'm so not busy and he is so busy and I have all this free time to think about him and wait for him and it's not healthy. But I can't imagine being busy myself is going to solve this problem because then neither of us will have time for hanging out.  

I also don't feel like I'm giving this a fair shot if I end it before we meet up for the first time, which will be in about a month. But even if that goes great, what happens after he leaves, and we still have 2-3 months of overlapping busy schedules to work through? Can a relationship last that long with sporadic, biweekly communication? If I give him my virginity when he visits, which I really intended on doing prior to this talk, will I become a clingy depressed loser after he leaves, and regret it all completely, especially with talks of breaking up this soon to his visit?  

Advise plz. Please please please. I am so lost and so confused and I feel like whatever happens, I'm going to be so hurt.

To make this question short, I received an email through LinkedIn from a man who works at GroupOn as their Senior Technical Recruiter. After some researching, this man seems to have also worked at recruiter.

The reason why I am suspicious, if that's the correct word, is because my LinkedIn profile is rather plain - people have endorsed certain technical skills, and all I really have is the four most recent, relevant, job titles and timelines. 

&gt;I’m reaching out to you, as a new R&amp;D team here at Groupon liked your profile and wanted me to connect with you as they'd love to chat with you about an opportunity to join them in the United States. 
&gt;
&gt;Due to the confidential nature of this technology, I can’t go into details in this email, but I can provide more information over the phone and will send descriptions and links after we chat. I can tell you that we'll be utilizing machine learning/mobile and geo location technology heavily - and with half a million merchants and 200 million customers, this has never been attempted or built by anyone at this scale. Since our beginnings 4 years ago - Groupon technology has funneled 6 billion dollars to local business, revenue solely generated to them by Groupon. This new technology should enable us to generate double if not tripple that revenue to small and local businesses, globally, truly disrupting commerce as we know it. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;This team will be in Canada the first week of June for the sole purpose of meeting with engineers interested in this opportunity. I’d love to connect this week for about 30 minutes via phone to discuss these roles, and can make myself available at a time that works for you. Please feel free to schedule a time that works for you on my calendar directly at [link taken out]. I look forward to chatting 


I was prompted for an interview time through the phone - which I did through doodle - and I took out of curiousity. I don't really use LinkedIn that much nor have I updated it that much either.

Am I right to be kind of curious and almost suspicious as to why I was selected?
If this is legitimate, how do I approach the interview tomorrow - should I mention at the start that I'm still a student? Do I assume this is like any other technical interview through the phone? If this isn't legitimate, what signs should I look for?

**tl;dr** got emailed through LinkedIn asking for a phone interview. LinkedIn profile barely has anything on it. Not sure if legitimate, and if legit, how to approach."

I'm not paid by the company, but by a third party. It's impossible for me to keep on working there. I have around $65,000 student loan debt, and I make almost nothing. I am granted the favor of being allowed to list a staff title (low ranking, but at least not ""intern"") on my resume and on the company's website. But it's not a very respectable industry. Very poor exit options.

After a very, very long period of not having any leads for good, full-time jobs with decent potential for career growth, I've gotten a little lucky recently. I got 3 rounds with a company in my desired field. Entry level position. But I also am in the 2nd round with a different company in my field, and also a 2nd round with a company in a different, less desired field, but for actually a higher position. No other offers yet.

At this point, my priority is getting any decent offer. Once I have a real job in a decent industry, I will be able to build on that and move up either there or through networking.

My question is - in lieu of an offer, is there a way to leverage late stage interviews (being very deep in the interview process) with one company for another? The first company actually told me two times, in my last interview, that I should tell them right away if I had any other offers, and that could speed their decision time up in giving me an offer. It's been a little over one week now since my final interview there. They told me they'd take a few weeks. I originally planned to follow up in two weeks. Not sure what I should do. Priority is getting any offer. Very risk averse to ending all these processes with nothing.

However, for the particular function specification I'm working to, the customer table calls for an additional field, Customer ID. The company is very specific on this customer ID it's got to be generated as follows, first letter is the first letter of the customer first name, 2nd letter is the 1st letter of the customers forename, then a string of numbers after this starting at 0000

So, a customer ID will be generated for each new customer added. For example if there was a customer named ""Tom Cruise"" and he was the 2541'st customer, his Customer ID would look as follows: TC2541. However, I'm having trouble generating this customer ID.

I've exhausted all knowledge of Access and I'm really having a hard time with this particular part of the database. I really would appreciate anyone's help with it. If you need more information about the database please just ask."
1e8hs2,2,2013-05-13,Should I do an extra year at university?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1e8hs2/should_i_do_an_extra_year_at_university/,"I've just finished up my second year at university in a 4 year commerce program. I attend a fairly new university and I'm worried that when I graduate with my degree I may not get a job due to its youth. However, my university offers an internship program to students who have a GPA of 3.0 (of a 4 point GPA scale). I'm currently sitting at a 2.2 GPA, but if I do an extra year I can redo about 6 classes and reach a GPA of 3.0. The problem is the amount of money that it will cost to essentially redo a whole semester is pretty substantial, plus that's a whole extra year of my life I'm spending still in school. Someone who graduated from my school said that I should strive to get an internship through the school as it has helped him land a good career. Another friend told me that to get an internship I don't *need* to get it through the school and can try and get one on my own. I originally never intended on doing an internship and, as such, I slacked off in many of my classes. Now that I realize how foolish I was I'm not quite sure which path I should take...any advice is appreciated!"
1e8hd9,1,2013-05-13,I think I'm in love with someone I shouldn't be,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1e8hd9/i_think_im_in_love_with_someone_i_shouldnt_be/,"I haven't been in a relationship that has lasted 2 months ever since my ex girlfriend who I dated for 2 years back in my junior and senior years of high school. She was a bitch but I was blinded by the false sense of love I felt for and received from her. After we broke up, I was heartbroken but eventually I realized that despite having treated her like a princess I wasn't treated well in return. This helped me move on from her but I was constantly in search of that feeling of love I felt for another. 

On top of all that, I am in my junior year of college and in an athletic training program. Early morning classes that are followed by leaving my campus and travel to other colleges to work in their athletic training rooms. Basically, I have almost no time to go out to put myself out there to meet new people because I feel tired as hell whenever I get back from my internship. 

Now let me give you a little background on what's going on now... I am really close to my cousin (He's not the one I'm in love with, don't worry) (Let’s call him Dan). Dan and I are really the best of friends and have been since we were little. Family holidays consisted of us just having a good time. Fast forward a few years and we both attend and live at the same college. Things have never been better. We ate together, we went on stupid adventures, and we played video games all night. Family holidays consisted of us just having a good time. To top it off, when I joined a fraternity, Dan was the first in line to join the following semester. 

Last semester: Dan had been dating this sorority girl (9/10) (Let’s call her Sara) for about a year and broke up with her because he didn't feel like they were meant to be. They go their separate ways and still are friendly with each other, but I remain close to her and visit her at work frequently. About 2 months later, he starts dating another girl in that same sorority. Things had a rocky beginning but have been going strong ever since. 

This semester: I was just coming off of another failed short term relationship and was feeling pretty down about it. The girl was nice but I didn't see the relationship going anywhere. About 2 month into the semester, I visited my Sara at work. We start talking about how much relationships have been going poorly for both of us and I try to make a joke by saying, ""You could've had this"" while pointing at myself. Cheesy, yes, I know. To my shock Sara replied with ""What says I can't?"" My jaw drops and was speechless, but somehow I get the words out to make plans with her to hang out that Friday night. Friday night comes we watch a movie and it leads to making out for a bit. At one point she grabs my dick over my pants and stops everything going on. She pretty much tells me she wanted sex but not that night. The very next night, she comes over and I had hands down the best sex I have ever had in my life. This happens for the next two weeks and I enjoy every minute of it. But as awesome as it was, I felt terrible because this was my cousin’s ex girlfriend. Spring break comes up and I hang out with her, take her on a simple date, and watch a movie back at my home. The date goes fantastically. Being spring break, I decided that this was a time to tell Dan that I have been seeing his Sara. He says he didn’t feel comfortable with it asks for it to end. I complied with him and had all intensions of ending it but I just couldn’t do it and since that point we haven’t seen each other as much and we aren’t as close as we used to be. 

Sara and I continued to see each other and spend the night in each other’s rooms. We would talk about everything and nothing all at the same time. I treated her the best I could and she reciprocated by treating me the best she could. Then Sara had dropped it on me that she has started to like me. At first I wasn’t ok with it but then I realized I had grown to actually like her. As much as I really enjoyed it, I knew I couldn’t continue doing this. Recently, I actually got the balls to put things on hold with her. It felt like I was breaking up with her and it hurt so bad and she was tearing up when I left her. I told her I’d always just be a text message away. The next couple days I felt like dirt and I genuinely missed her. Somehow we end up hanging out again in my room and I enjoyed every second I spent with her. 

To sum it all up, I really do think I am in love Sara, but I really don’t know what to do about it. Do I keep it inside and just eventually find someone else or go for it and ask her to be my girlfriend?"

1e8a3g,0,2013-05-13,20yrs old - College Student - Inherited $40k - What to do? (USA),[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1e8a3g/20yrs_old_college_student_inherited_40k_what_to/,"First and foremost, thanks for the help.

I just inherited $40,000 from my father's passing. It still has to go through the probate steps but I am preparing myself. I am also executor of his will so I will know exactly when as well.

Currently I am in school at college with an internship this summer (starting next week) with the following financial info: 

* $2100 take home pay monthly for 3 months ($1050 bi-weekly)
* No housing expenses (provided with internship)
* $100 in gas monthly
* $200 in food monthly (high estimation)

After the summer these are my financial info for 9 months:

* $600 take home pay monthly
* $180 rent
* ~$40 utilities
* $200 in food (high estimation)

My current debt is:

* $15,500 student loan, current balance: $16,784 @ 5.2% Variable
* $21,500 student loan, current balance: $22,282 @ 7.0% Variable

So my question is: What do I do with my inheritance? 

I have no idea about the new student loan I will have to take out because my FAFSA needs to be updated. My EFC before my father's passing provided me $0 of financial aid. I am in the process of working that out and since I do not have a mother either so the EFC should be next to nothing. In the will, I will get $5000 a semester for school which will cover about half the tuition. 

I am pretty good with financial stuff, I currently have a Roth IRA with ~ $2,500 in it and a state retirement account with ~$1200 in it. 

I've initially thought about doing a 3-month CD so I don't spend the money and so I can figure out the FAFSA stuff and it will give me time to figure this all out. 

Thanks for all the help and I can provide info as needed. "

I do well in school, I have tons of job opportunities once I am done, I have had a few internships. Overall I am pretty happy, I mean no one is truly happy happy..but I am good. I like my life so far *knocks on wood*

I don't have a problem with women in terms of sleeping with them. That's an issue that I solved a long time ago.

When I was 18, I met this girl and she never agreed to be my girlfriend (I don't blame her now, I fully understand why she didn't want to date me. I was a boy..mentally)

We were very good friends before we started sleeping  but fought a lot when we started sleeping together..mostly because of me. As much as I hate to admit it now, it was because of me. I was a clingy guy desperate to get her to commit to me.

I never could...it took me about 1.5 years to stop thinking about her on a daily basis (it was a rough time for me) but I eventually stopped...during the entire process, I made an effort to meet girls...I forgive the first 2-3 for sleeping with them while thinking about another girl.


Time has passed, I am older and I have seen and talked to her. I have no anger or feelings towards her anymore. It's just some girl that I used to know. Which I am very happy about. Believe me. Very happy.

It's very hard to try to live a normal life while you think of someone else that has left you.


I can't seem to date girls normally, I have this constant fear that I'll go back to feeling like that...I have certainly learned to deal with emotional stuff better and it won't take me a year and a half...but I don't want feel like someone has so much power to hurt me that way again.

 I have an issue dating girls, I can't let them get close to me at all. I am scared that they'll hurt my feelings or emotionally abuse me.


I have trust issues with girls and as soon as a girl shows/does anything similar to what this girl ever did to me that I didn't like...I just lose interest. Even if it's nothing bad.

**tl;dr** I don't trust girls at all and I have become a border line nazi when it comes to the girls that I am seeing...one little thing and I get scared and just ""fuck it"" everything and emotionally detach myself from her..really fast.

1e865t,2,2013-05-13,What am I doing - Comp Sci major to History PhD to Marketing to maybe programming again?? Need advice.,Comet7777,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1e865t/what_am_i_doing_comp_sci_major_to_history_phd_to/,"Hey everyone, 

I have a suspicion that I am not alone in being in my early to mid 20s without having a real exact idea with what I want to do for the rest of my life. I had programmed in highschool in various AP courses as well as for fun (programmed games). I went to college on a computer science scholarship thinking that would be the logical choice for me. After two years of doing computer science and becoming somewhat jaded (in retrospect it had more to do with myself than with the discipline), I wanted to challenge myself and make meaning of my life and switched over to a history and english double major. I managed to finish my degree on time even though I made a radical change. 

Things get interesting when I then was accepted to a Masters program for History. I really enjoyed what I learned and took it to a PhD program (all fully paid for by the department, with a nice yearly stipend too so it wasn't that much of a financial risk). I'm almost done with my coursework and on the verge of starting my dissertation writing process and I think I'm completely burnt out. I've come to this conclusion for a number of reasons: 1) the job market for my discipline and subfield is atrocious. If you land the coveted tenure-track job you've successfully have won the lottery. I refuse to slave away teaching 5-7 classes per semester as an adjunct to barely scrape by at maybe $30k/year since all that work guarantees you can't put time and energy into resumes and writing samples to get a better job. And 2) the idyllic professor job isn't so ideal after all. My wife is a teacher herself and she spends 10 hours at her school, comes home exhausted, and has to plan and grade all evening. It's hardly a life, and with us wanting to start a family, it doesn't make much sense for two of us to be doing the same thing. 

So, Reddit, I turn to you guys for advice. Since the job market looks awful I've decided to be proactive and engage with the private sector. I managed to snag a nice paid internship as a Market Researcher at an IT company. This is allowing me to network, gain crucial experience, and to learn what office environments are like. I've been really enjoying the whole ordeal. I recently learned that a few of us interns were brought in with the specific goal of turning us into full time employees. I would normally be suspicious of such a claim but this company was just recently acquired by an equity firm and is nearly doubling in size this year. It doesn't seem like a stretch that I could be offered a full time position contingent on my performance. Furthermore, since it is an IT company I'm working for and I have a TON of friends in the industry working as various sorts of programmers, it would seem that if I stayed in this industry I'd have a solid network already. Moreover, I've seen the career trajectories (and the stability) of programmers. It's been making me think that maybe I should refine my programming skills and follow that path. 

In conclusion, it seems that I can either 1) finish the PhD and pray pray pray that I land a tenure track job, 2) following this marketing gig since I'm actually utilizing the skillset I've developed in grad school and has a good potential for a career, or 3) since I have a foot in the door in the IT industry, maybe I can go back to programming?

Reddit - what say you?

TLDR - was a CS major but switched to history/english. Half-way through a PhD in history but got a marketing research gig and am enjoying it and am now deciding between going into marketing or programming (since I have a background of that already). I don't know what I'm doing with my life (long TLDR lol).

I am currently a physics/math undergrad at MSU in Michigan, and as the titles says, I have an internship with Wolfram from mid-May to Mid-August. I have been looking for subleases on craigslist but surprisingly few people actually respond to emails to their craigslist accounts. So I was wondering if there were other resources on how to find good (hopefully cheap, as I am paying rent here in MI as well as in IL) sublets. Also, as I don't know anybody here, are there any fun things to do around UIUC that I should check out before I leave the state? Also, is anybody else working for Wolfram this summer?

If you are not:
	A. Employed full time (Waiters do not count)
	B. Going to school full time
	C. A mix of work and school 
	D. Looking 8 hours a day for a job and sending out applications

Side Note: If you are a college graduate and can't find work in Atlanta, but they offer you a job somewhere else MOVE!! You are not married, and you don't have kids! Don't be stupid, and throw your live away because you are scared to leave mommy and daddy.

And for everyone still in college try and find an internship or you'll be screwed as well!

1ecfqq,5,2013-05-14,"Instead of fapping everyday, here are my new routines. What are yours?",GayNoFap,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1ecfqq/instead_of_fapping_everyday_here_are_my_new/,"Nofap has to come with other efforts to improve your life, and to do so in a realistic way by setting realistic goals.  What will you do instead of fap?  Can you keep those routines up?

For me, I've been allowing school to be an excuse for being lazy and letting fapping be my release.  I got through 11 days before finding that all the time at my desk preparing for final exams and wanting to think about anything other than final exams just led me back to PMO.  Now I plan on using the summer to develop momentum for those routines that will take me into the next school year.  Besides the 90 day challenge, I'm starting small:

**1. [The Lifehacker workout.](http://lifehacker.com/tag/the-lifehacker-workout)**  Three days a week of full body exercise.  Two days are 20 minutes of some form of running and 10-20 minutes of simple strength exercises that don't require any equipment.  One day is a deck of cards routine that is a fun randomizer.

The 20 minute running periods have a goal to run farther than I had the previous 20 minutes.  My previous attempts to get into a running routine have failed because I pushed myself too hard with various couch to 5k or run everyday sort of things.  I'm starting easy, run for a minute, walk for 90 seconds, repeat until 20 minutes is expired.  As the summer goes on I'll be increasing the continuing running periods, until I'm eventually at a single 20-minute run period.  This sets me up for success, as right now it is an aerobic workout for me to run just those 8 minutes out of 20, but as I increase my amount of running time, I'll be increasing my distance as well.

The 10 minutes of simple strength exercises are just sets of 5 push-ups, 10 crunches, and 15 body-weight squats.  The goal is to do as many as you can in 10 minutes.  Proper push-ups are hard, I could only do two sets before I got dizzy and had to stop.  But it's okay, because I feel like it worked, and I feel like I can only go up from here.  As the weeks go on, I'll increase the number of minutes.

The deck of cards routine is a different set of four exercises.  Hearts are jumping jacks or jump rope (think heart for aerobic exercise that works your heart), and the other suits are chair dips, knee-to-elbow planks, and lunges.  You can start with however many cards you like, the goal being to work your way up to a full deck.  I'm starting from a quarter deck.

At the end of it, I have a planned break which I'll use to evaluate whether I want to continue with that workout, maybe throw in an extra day of targeted workouts that the Lifehacker workout offers as an optional workout, or maybe I'll even be in the mood for something more extreme like P90X.  Planning a break also gives me an end goal.  I'm not exercising forever, I'm exercising 36 times over the next 12 weeks.  I also created an appropriate chain at chains.cc.

**2. Rise with the morning sun.**  My sleep habits turned to total shit during the school year, and only got worse during final exams.  I want to evaluate my sleep, so I downloaded a 99 cent sleep tracking app, [Sleep Cycle](http://www.sleepcycle.com/), that monitors my movements in bed to determine the quality of my sleep.  The app also monitors when I'm in my lightest sleep as the moment to determine whether to sound an alarm clock within a 30 minute window, on the theory that the lighter your sleep when woken, the more pleasant it is to wake up for the day.

I'm also getting to sleep earlier, because my window shades are not blackout shades, and my best rest will come in the darkness.  Rising with the Sun also helps me accomplish my exercise goals, since I know I'll beg off if I wait for after my summer internship work, or there will be varying after-work socializing that will go on.

**3. Shower &amp; shave EVERY DAY**  I set up another chain at chains.cc, because I realized that part of what would make me feel unproductive is that I wouldn't want to do anything until I showered and shaved, but then I wouldn't want to shower and shave until I had something to eat, and round-and-round I would go until half of Saturday or Sunday is gone.  I've had to turn down too many last minute social opportunities for want of a shower and a shave, and truth be told, a fap instead.  I tried cold showers during my first attempt, and while refreshing, the prospect of them was so daunting that I would revert to not showering at all.  Again, simple goals."

1ecdsi,253,2013-05-14,Business Casual for Interns and New Hires: Tips and Resources,aktuarie,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ecdsi/business_casual_for_interns_and_new_hires_tips/,"I've seen quite a few requests about clothing for internships and new jobs in recent weeks so I thought I’d write up my observations and add a few resources.

First off, I realize this is not a one-size-fits-all topic. I’m writing this from the perspective of the US office I work in – which has a ‘business’ dress code (just short of full suit every day). I know that offices have widely varying dress, but with some changes in fabrics and styles, this guide can be accommodated to almost any dress code. 

If anyone in other countries or with dressier or more casual codes can chime in with additional suggestions that would be awesome!

**Here’s the low-down:**

* **No one really pays much attention to what you’re wearing.** Forget about wearing a different outfit every single day. If you can make ~10 outfits (2 business weeks), you’re good to go without having to do too much laundry.
* **Keep department demographics in mind.** Is your area of the office young and trendy, a mix, or does it skew a bit older? Use this information when you’re considering buying that neon pink blouse.
* **It’s easier to dress down than up.** If you’re feeling pretty clueless about the dress code, it’s better to go a little dressier than you think it will be than risk going too casual. Take off the blazer or roll up your sleeves if needing to look less formal.
* **Fit is more important than price.** And by fit, I mean something probably a bit looser than everyday wear. Pants shouldn’t be glued to your legs, skirts and dresses need to hit close to knee-length while standing, and blouses need to… blouse *(without cleavage)*.
* **LAYERS.** It is shocking how cold an air-conditioned office can be when you’re sitting and permanently damaging your vision staring at spreadsheets. Bring a spare sweater to stash away on your first day.
* **Shop your existing wardrobe first.** Start with that snazzy suit you interviewed in. Maybe you have a couple nice blouses, cardigans, even a dress. Buying a totally new wardrobe for 10 weeks is wasteful of beer money if you’re not completely sure you’ll wear the items again. For new grads – don’t spend your bonus until you have other things like furniture under control, and you’ve fully evaluated the dress code environment.
* **Walking shoes.** You may think you’re ace at bar hopping in heels, but if you’ll be in a walking city like Chicago or New York, for the sake of your feet and the sake of your shoes, please buy a comfortable pair of flats for walking to and from work. Get a tote (also useful for brown bagging that lunch) and keep your heels in there.

**Guideline wardrobe**

* 2-3 pairs of dress pants *(look for dressy fabrics that feel silky/smooth, generally avoid chinos/khakis)*
* 2-3 skirts *(at least 1 of these should be a neutral colored pencil skirt)*
* 2-3 dresses *(wrap dresses and sheaths look good on most figures)*
* 5-7 blouses *(button-downs, shells, light sweaters, etc)*
* 2-3 cardigans *(at least one in a neutral)*
* 1 blazer
* 1 pair heels *(closed-toe and 3 inches or less is a good idea)*
* 1 pair of dress flats
* 1 pair of walking shoes *(avoid: Crocs, bright colors. I have a pair of black [Skechers GoWalks](http://www.amazon.com/Skechers-Womens-Walk-Slip-On-Black/dp/B0058XJ5PA/))*

If you’re awesome and can make everything mix and match, the minimums will honestly last you throughout the summer with few repeats. [Check out this amazing capsule wardrobe from Outfit Posts and the 30 combinations she came up with just 14 pieces.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rc6DsvTytTI/ULLmFfSxJiI/AAAAAAAASKw/UjpbZArG2Ks/s3200/FULL+header+and+outfit+image.jpg)

Minus the jeans, all these outfits would be very appropriate at my office for the summer. [Original Source](http://outfitposts.blogspot.com/2012/11/one-suitcase-business-casual-capsule_6313.html)

**Shopping Resources:**

Buying basic pieces like a suit, pants, skirt, and sheath dress is worth investing a bit more than other pieces because of their versatility and the amount of wear they’ll get *(but if it’s not in your budget, it’s totally cool and it will be fine, see the next paragraph)*. I’m a big fan of [The Limited](http://www.thelimited.com/), but [Nordstrom](http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/womens-clothing-wear-to-work-shop), [LOFT](http://www.loft.com/loft/catalog/category.jsp?catid=catl000019&amp;supCat=catl00002), [Ann Taylor](http://www.anntaylor.com/ann/editorial/AT-Lookbook/ANN-Wear-To-Work/cata000059), [J Crew](http://www.jcrew.com/womens_special_shops/weartoworkshop.jsp), [White House Black Market](http://www.whitehouseblackmarket.com/store/browse/shelf.jsp?cat=Workkit&amp;catId=cat6219285), [Banana Republic](http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/division.do?cid=5002), and sometimes [Express](http://www.express.com/clothing/Women/Suit+Shop/cat/cat290005) are all good places to look for these pieces.

For blouses, cardigans, shoes, and accessories, less investment is necessary, particularly if you want trendier colors and prints. Stores like [Forever 21](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Main.aspx?br=f21) and [H&amp;amp;M](http://www.hm.com/us/department/LADIES) can be good, but pay very close attention to washing instructions, fit, and how sturdy the seams are. It may not usually be your cuppa tea, but stores like [JCPenney](http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom/women/dept.jump?id=dept20000013) and [Kohl’s](http://www.kohls.com/sale-event/women.jsp?CN=3000000103) have some pretty decent business clothing at pretty good prices. Thrift shops can also have nice business clothes for cheap. Make sure to check for pilling, ripped seams, stains *(check the armpits!)*, shoulder pads, and snags.

If you have a couple of weeks and want to get really good deals, I’ve had a lot of success with [Hukkster](http://www.hukkster.com). It’s easy to use and it will give you e-mail alerts when the items you’ve set up go on sale.

**Wardrobe cleaning and care**

Try to find machine wash items as much as possible. Tumble dry is also a bonus, but always do it on low! If you're using a commercial dryer, these items may be better off hung to dry. Some items like blazers and nicer skirts and pants will be dry clean only. This does not need to cost you a fortune with a little extra attention. In general, you can wear almost everything multiple times before washing/dry cleaning if you're good about putting clothes on a hook or hanging up right after taking it off. Here are some good guidelines:

* Pants and skirts - 5-6 times
* Blazers can go even longer between dry cleaning - 12-15 wears, perhaps longer if it's getting minimal pit contact.
* Dresses - 2-3 times (more like 1-2 in the summer when it's boiling)
* Sweaters/Cardigans used as layering item - 5-6 times
* Blouses - 1-2 times *(unless you're a magical unicorn who doesn't perspire from your armpits)*"

I have a degree in TV Production, but have been out of it for awhile as I could only get freelance work for a long time, then that slowed down and had to work in other fields.

Ultimately, I would love to do something media related, whether it be TV, radio, writing, but at this point, I'm getting pretty desperate and am not having a ton of luck finding any work. 

Most internships out there are shady or you have to be in college, which I am not. I am mostly looking for part-time right now because I am considering going back to school upgrade my skills/knowledge since things keep changing, but, if there is a good enough FT, I'd be interested as well.

Adobe Creative Suite, Final Cut Pro, Photoshop, Microsoft Office Suite, experience with blogging and other social media advertising and writing.**

If someone can help me find any work that you believe I am qualified for based off of my list/what I am looking for, please let me know! I'm also located in the East Bay, (Walnut Creek area) but am willing to commute if I have to, as long as it is reasonable and my commute doesn't end up costing me more than I'd make at the job!

1ec80c,139,2013-05-14,Flaws of Dark Souls,DarQraven,truegaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1ec80c/flaws_of_dark_souls/,"Now, to get some things out of the way immediately: 

- Yes, it's hard, it's unforgiving and I love it. It's currently my most played game after SC2.
- Yes, I am a relative newbie to the game. I've only finished the game once and haven't gotten very far yet with an NG+ playthrough. In most singleplayer games that would qualify you as at least somewhat knowledgeable, but I realize DS is a bit of a different beast in that regard.
- I realize this game is/has been reddit's wet dream concerning skill-based game design in the recent past. I also realize I risk pissing off a large contingent of avid fans. However, I notice a serious lack of discussion about the game that doesn't justify any and all flaws as ""it's just hardcore like that. L2P.""

What I want to do in this thread is have that discussion: take an objective look at the game's pros and cons and try to be honest about what is unforgiving game design and what is sloppy and/or broken. In order to further the state of the gaming industry, it would be helpful to pinpoint exactly what can be learned from DS.

---

To start things off myself:

**Invasions**:

For a PvE player like myself, they're just stupid. You're merrily on your way, fighting some new kind of monster, barely hanging on and xXxR4ng3rKn1ght420xXx steps up and backstabs you, and you are now potentially out of X humanity and (in my most recent case) ~40.000 souls. Focus on the invader and the regular monsters will kill you. As any PvP player will tell you, the soul level limit does very little to keep fights balanced when players can make dedicated PvP characters and transfer high-level gear to them.

Of course, you can only get invaded when you are in human form. Same with summoning allies or NPCs. Risk vs reward type design, it makes sense, and this is usually how players justify this design. 
I would agree if it were not for this one thing: *You can't avoid being human quite regularly.* There is no way to kindle bonfires without that. 
When do you kindle bonfires? *When you've just arrived in an area and are having a hard time, almost by definition.*

The design choice to link activating/upgrading a save point and opening yourself up to PvP is a nonsensical one, IMO. It makes you vulnerable to other players with the sole intention of killing you at exactly the time when you are weakest. Gameplay-wise, the two have nothing to do with eachother. The only way to avoid it is go through the game with only 5 Estus flasks. For a game that prides itself on being skillbased, brutal and honest, being randomly assassinated by overleveled players is a bad fit.

**Weapon hits/collisions**:

Why is it that my uchi gets stuck on a wall when I slash more or less parallel to it, yet that Titanite Demon over there swings a huge axe through two solid walls and hits me? Don't get me wrong, it's not a huge issue or anything, but there are instances in the game where a fight is uncharacteristically hard because you are hindered by your surroundings while your opponents are not. This is pretty much the sole reason I stopped using greatswords - it is simply too common to get into areas where you can't even swing them properly. Getting hit by a dagger through a massive column is not good game design no matter how you spin it, and it seems more like an oversight or laziness on the developer's part than anything that can be justified as a conscious design choice.

There are other instances where the weapon hit detection is a bit dodgy. Getting hit by the slow-moving blunt rear-end of a spear, for example, and taking full stab damage. Or enemies adjusting their flight path or facing in mid-air to compensate for your movement.

If this were the first game in the series I would be understanding of these errors. However, it isn't. I never played Demon's Souls, but I'm assuming it was the same in that game? If this is a conscious decision, what could possibly justify it? I am at a loss.

**Blighttown**

This area isn't actually all that difficult combat wise. It's just bloody annoying. The level design has you walking across all kinds of rickety structures, often with strange geometry sticking out or holes in the surfaces. I think the moving bridge takes the cake: standing still at certain spots while it's moving will slide you off the side due to weird bounding boxes. Now, when you put enemies in an area like this that are capable of bumping you into a chasm even if you block their attack, you're just messing with players. You're more or less forcing a bunch of random deaths caused by unpredictable/unavoidable knockbacks (depending on player build and loadout. For a shield+sword player, or heavy armor player this is hell. Dodge-based characters will have a hard time as well, but at least it's in their own hands whether they dodge off a bridge or not.)

Then there's the fact that you *will* get poisoned going through the swamp no matter how high your poison resistance is and there is no merchant in the area. In order to get through Quelaag, I had to get back out of the Swamp, back up to Undead Burg, buy a ton of moss clumps and get back in. Complete time sink for very little (if any) gain in gameplay quality.
Also, toxic blowdarts with laser guidance.

So, what are your thoughts? Feel free to attack any of my points above as long as your main argument is not ""learn to play"". If I was just bothered by the game being difficult I would not be going through a second playthrough now.

**TL;DR: If you had to explain some of Dark Soul's oddities and were forbidden to use ""it's unforgiving"" as an argument, what would you say? What are some of the weakest points of the game, overlooked or not?**

*Edit, Two more additions. Thanks for the discussion so far!*

**The design of the primordial serpents**
I realize this one is a bit more of a subjective thing, but what the hell. Serpents with human teeth? A skull that more or less protrudes out the side of their body? I'm not sure if the intention was to make these look goofy as fuck, but that's what they managed. For a game with otherwise amazing art direction, I'm not sure which intern got tasked with designing these.

**Unreliable triggers**
In a game where experimentation and trial-and-error is encouraged so much, I feel special attention should be given to the scripting of game events and sequences. Currently, there are quite a few opportunities for players to irreversibly screw themselves by missing, glitching or otherwise triggering an event ""wrong"". 
Examples: 

- Fall down Frampt's pit before talking to him and place the Lordvessel? Both Frampt and Kaathe will now assume you picked the other one, and neither will be accessible for the rest of the game (even though the player is probably not even aware of Kaathe at this point in the game).
- Siegmeyer can get glitched and not show up in Anor Londo, even if you saved him in Sen's. You are required to go back to Sen's, redirect the boulder machine, then talk to Siegmeyer again and he will possibly be fixed. I've heard mixed reports about whether this actually works. Already beat O&amp;S? Byebye Siegmeyer storyline.
- Being able to kill Gwynevere in Anor Londo without triggering the results, simply by using a ranged weapon outside of her room. (Not sure if this one still works, but it used to.)

**Controls oddities**
You almost never use a ranged weapon when you are in lock-on range. So, you're mostly going to be using the zoomed-in mode. Why, then, do you need to explicitly exit this zoom mode before you can swap your weapon to a different one? Dodge doesn't work, running doesn't work, estus doesn't work, nothing works. Only LB1 and RB1. See an enemy coming up to attack and want to get your shield out and block? LB1, d-pad away from bow, LB1. A bit weird.

Same thing for the in-game menu. It's not particularly handy to block off your estus, run and roll buttons as long as you have the UI open. I like how it doesn't pause the game, but then you should also execute the concept fully and be able to completely control your character with the menu open. This half-way approach isn't very good."
1ec7vp,5,2013-05-14,I haven't come clean about the last ten years of my life to ANYONE.,ireviewfanfiction,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ec7vp/i_havent_come_clean_about_the_last_ten_years_of/,"Hoo boy. Buckle up, because this is a LONG story. (ALSO ALL NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED)

I recognize that this may not be important/interesting to anyone, and I don't want to lead you down the wrong path and make you think this story is about truly horrible things (SPOILER: I didn't get into drugs, I haven't been sexually abused, I haven't intentionally or seriously hurt or sexually abused anyone else, etc. and so forth). But because of how long this story is, and because of how much of it I haven't explained, in context, to anyone (not even my wife), I feel as though putting this out there will be healing in some way.

It started right around ten years ago, when I was a junior in high school. I was a stereotypical nerd. I had thick glasses, wore clothes that didn't fit me, had a crush on a popular girl who didn't reciprocate (though we did become platonic friends), and had friends who really were only friends to use me as the butt of their jokes. By the beginning of my junior year, I had cut off all contact with pretty much everyone and spent most of my time on Ye Olde Internet, writing a lot, and making online friends in various writing communities.

Then, I met Stephanie. Stephanie was nice, pretty, had big boobs (important to a 17-year-old boy!), and liked me. She was dating someone at the time, but soon broke it off with him as we became better friends. Stephanie, her friend Mikki, my friend Harry, and I all hung out for the majority of my senior year. Stephanie and I were wary about dating because I'd be heading to college a year ahead of her, and I planned to do so about 8 hours out of state. But before that summer, we decided to give it a go.

When I first met Stephanie, her and Mikki gave me what I can only describe as a makeover. Gone were the ill-fitting clothes and in were more fashionable, trendy clothes. The glasses were replaced by contacts. The haircut was now stylish instead of ridiculous. It was like a gender-reversal She's All That. It was cool, though, because for the first time in my life I felt like someone physically desirable. 

That senior year featured more flirting than I had ever experienced before in my life. And all that writing I had been doing had adjusted my brain so I actually understood how to talk to people (and flirt back!). Still, the flirting was a little awkward, mostly because these girls knew me as that kid who didn't talk to anyone just a year ago and I felt a bit like I was putting on an act trying to be a suave guy.

Still, for someone who had been ignored for so long, the attention went to my head. My flirting going over the line to Stephanie's annoyance (and eventual hurt) would become a theme in our relationship. Tori would be the first in this regard.

Stephanie, Tori and I met because we all worked at a restaurant the summer before my freshman year at college. Tori, it must be said, was EASY. She had slept with a bunch of people, cycled through boyfriends and boytoys at an alarming rate, and fooled around with more. She wasn't stunningly attractive, just thin and not ugly and promiscuous, which to most guys is close enough. And she liked me right away and wanted to sleep with me.

And so I did. Before going to pick up Stephanie from work one evening, Tori decided she wanted to de-virginize me (Stephanie and I hadn't gone all the way yet). I let her.

NSFW BIT HERE: Stephanie and I had fooled around a bit, oral sex and hand stuff, etc. I had also sometimes ""slipped it in"", though it never went further than that. What I discovered through that, though, is that Stephanie was TIGHT. Like, ""It is realllly difficult to get more than one finger in her"" tight. Tori was THE EXACT OPPOSITE. I put on a condom, and honestly got NOWHERE even 20 minutes in.

Short, SFW version: My first time resulted in me not finishing.

Afterward, I felt stupid and sleazy and dumb. I ended my friendship with Tori and eventually Stephanie and I stated sleeping together. It was really good. And because our relationship was growing in such a way, we decided to try to make it work long-distance while I was at college.

PEOPLE OF REDDIT: THIS IS ALWAYS A DUMB DECISION. Long-distance relationships are well-meaning and emotionally fulfilling, but they are unnecessarily painful, wildly difficult to navigate, and more trouble than they're worth. Also you don't get to have sex as often as you'd like, which sounds shallow, sure, but sex is important even if we don't want to admit it! And the problem is less that you can't have it, but that you can't have the intimacy that sex provides with your partner when you're going through a rough, disconnected time. All our sex felt perfunctory while I was away at college, like it was something we had to do on the weekends she was around, not like it was a healthy part of our relationship.

That first year I was at college doomed our relationship, but we wouldn't know it for YEARS.

I didn't sleep with anyone else, I want to make that clear. But like I said, I had been a nerd for years. The opposite sex didn't look at me ""like that."" But suddenly I was at college and I could play guitar (as much as I didn't want to be THAT GUY I was admittedly sometimes THAT GUY) and I could make girls laugh and I wasn't a douchebag. My first week I made out with four girls. Throughout the rest of the year, I probably made out with at least one more a month. I hit on a lot more than that.

What I realize, looking back, is how blatantly my actions (even now) have been influenced by the DESPERATE need for attention from the opposite sex. I went 16 years being completely ignored as a sexual entity, and once I got it I became kind of addicted to it. I'm less a sex addict and more addicted to the idea of being the object of someone's infatuations. This, more than the idea that I didn't want to cheat, led to me not sleeping with the girls I made out with.

This desire also led to a weird thing: I created a blog under an alias and posted a lot of BS pseudo-intellectual/pseudo-poetic shit with the EXPRESS PURPOSE of pulling a Catfish on some girl(s). This is HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR and I am ASHAMED. But, what weirdly came out of it, was a really and GENUINELY close connection with a girl that went from posting on each other's ""walls"" to IMing to calling almost daily. I was conducting an emotional affair with this girl.

Stephanie snuck into my e-mail one day and found out.

Stephanie had trust issues, and me being so far away and going out to parties and blah blah blah, only amplified them. So she snuck into my e-mail to see what was going on and found my collaborations with this girl. To be clear, I hadn't said anything incriminating (There were no OH I LUV U BUT messages, just personal stuff exchanged), but I was hiding my relationship with a person from Stephanie and she reacted. Of course she did.

This established a pattern for the next two years. I would crush on someone else, create a friendship with them, fortify that friendship with discrete messages and flirting that could be construed as harmless but probably wasn't, Stephanie would find out, we would have an argument, I would apologize and we would be fine. It wasn't even just women I had (and still have) a habit of telling white lies to avoid conversations (example: If Stephanie would ask if I had washed the dishes, I would say I had even if I hadn't and then just make sure to do them before she got home). Sometimes I would get caught in these, and the argument/make-up cycle would begin again.

That makes our relationship sound terrible; it wasn't. We got along very well, we had similar senses of humor, aside from a few months her freshman year (she ended up coming to the same college as me), she wasn't super controlling or unreasonable, we had good sex, we helped each other through rough times. When we moved in together in early 2007, we had settled into a good pattern and I really put a curb to my flirtations.

Then I got a crush on her younger sister.

Seventeen at the time, Sarah was model-beautiful (I mean that literally, she was randomly approached to model on a consistent basis), had an amazing body, was quick as a whip and clever as a fox (two things Stephanie wasn't), and was more interested in the things I too was interested in.

Obviously, this crush was stupid and could not be acted upon, so I didn't. But the crush didn't go away. For two years, I harbored this secret and didn't tell anyone. However, attractions like that manifest themselves and Stephanie kind of sort of knew that I found her sister attractive. As someone who didn't have the greatest self-esteem, Stephanie was jealous of her younger sister, but only in an idle way as they were great friends.

Finally, I decided I had to tell Sarah. She was 19 and I was 23 at the time. It was an uncomfortable, but not hostile situation and getting it off my chest helped me to get over the feeling rather quickly.

A few months later, I moved from my college town to a big city, having received an internship at my dream job. While I was down there, Stephanie and I spoke every day, but the distance was again problematic (DON'T DO LTRS, REDDIT. IF THERE IS ANY LESSON IN ALL OF THIS, IT IS DON'T DO LTRS). She was still in school, and would be for a year, and because of that Stephanie and I decided to take a break.

It wasn't a REAL break, though. It was more ""I still love you and I want just you but I don't know I'm confused"" from Stephanie and ""I love you too, and I don't understand this but I don't want you to be miserable pining after me in this situation"" from me. And, yes, I'll admit I was excited by the idea of being single in a big city, even if just for a short while.

I didn't sleep with anyone else, but I made out with a few people and tried to score dates and not get evicted and work my dream job (they offered me a position shortly after my internship) for very little money and just in general figure things out. After a couple months, Stephanie decided that she didn't want to be on a break anymore and a month later I was fired during some downsizing and had to move out of the big city and back in with Stephanie.

A month after that, Stephanie snuck into my e-mail and found out I had had a crush on her sister.

This was devastating to her, and really was a culmination of every problem in our relationship: Her trust issues and my issues with white lies and flirtation being the most obvious. We had a long argument and discussion where we almost broke up and then didn't.

And then, everything was great. I thought, genuinely, that we were over the hump and it would be smooth sailing to careers, marriage, and kids at that point. We'd been together six years. It seemed like the logical progression. You could read into why I didn't ask her as being indicative of doubts in the relationship or whatever, but it was honestly not that. I expected that we'd get married, I just wanted to propose ""right"" with a nice ring and a unique method. I also wanted to get settled, so that the wedding would be the only thing we had to worry about. I went about all of this very practically.

We moved after she graduated and got a job in a different city. I found a ""career"" type job. One of the first people I met was Jake, a friend of Stephanie's from her new job. We went over to his house to watch the first NFL game of the season and hung out with Jake's wife and their two kids. Soon, we found a venue for getting married and we even decided, in our heads, what the date would be. We started looking at rings.

Then, kind of apropos nothing that I could tell, we started getting into fights, and Stephanie started asking questions about the reasons we were together. She started freaking out about being only with me and started talking about taking a break. I was confused, but in my mind this was the same kind of ""break"" she wanted when I was in Chicago: some time to get her head back on straight and then we'd move on.

She kept talking about it, and I went out of town to hang out with some college friends on my birthday-- Stephanie had to work. I ran into one of Stephanie's good friends from school, and a couple of her acquaintances with whom I had become friendly but she wasn't exactly friends with. I told them what was going on, mostly because I wanted pity from pretty women.

The next week, Stephanie found out. She insisted, to my confusion but supplication, that I move out. I did so, bitter about us having this argument about something so stupid, unsure with how to proceed, just sort of aimless. My work performance suffered, and I was pretty depressed. But, and I actually enjoyed this part of things, I was suddenly freed up to connect with friends of mine that I hadn't spoken to in years. Specifically, female friends with whom I had only a platonic relationship, but Stephanie was still jealous of and didn't want me hanging out with. I took these opportunities with the thought that, once back together, I would be able to re-negotiate the terms of our relationship in my favor.

But that didn't happen. We talked once in a rare while to deal with ""business"" type things: ""This is mine, I'm going to pick it up,"" ""We need to get the cable bill out of my name."" These would all end up with her crying and me waiting for her to ask for me back, her not doing it, and me being confused and too proud to do it myself.

After a few months of this, she called me over and told me that she had broken up with me to begin an affair with Jake. They had been planning it for a month before I had been kicked out and started immediately getting together. She told me because she was ending it with him and maybe wanted to get back together.

I helped her feel better (Why? I don't know. I don't like to be mean, I guess?) and told her I'd think about it and get back to her tomorrow. I talked with friends and told her we couldn't until she got the situation with Jack-- who she was still working with-- resolved. She agreed. I didn't hear back from her for a month.

When she called again she told me that she had gotten back with Jake again, but this time she was really ending it. I told her okay. We hung out maybe once because I was lonely and hadn't met anyone and wanted to feel attached to someone again. I think through all of this I was more hurt by the idea that ANYONE didn't love me most more than the idea that STEPHANIE didn't love me most, but when you're that depressed you can't make those distinctions.

A month later, her brother died. This was really messed up and difficult, of course, and I said I'd be there for the funeral, as I had gone to school with her brother and been semi-friends with him. What I didn't expect was for Jake to be there, too. But he was, and I was livid, but held it together. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't make a scene.

A week later, Stephanie called me, saying that THIS TIME FOR REAL she had broken it off with Jake. They weren't getting back together. I told her how upset I was, how messed up it was of her to do that when she knew I'd be there given our ongoing situation, how stupid she was for cheating on me. She insisted she hadn't cheated. I told her that not breaking up with someone, telling them you still want to be with them, and still sleeping with someone else was the definition of cheating. She cried, I hung up. I then proceeded to go out and sleep with someone else for the first time.

As much as all my interactions with Stephanie were difficult and heart-throbbing and upsetting, when I was able to get away from the situation, I was still me. I was still flirtatious (more so, being single) and still loved to get attention from girls. This wasn't affecting every aspect of my life because I keep things so compartmentalized. This compartmentalization is also why I've never told this story FULLY to anyone. So I went out and I slept with someone, and then I went and slept with another person. 

NSFW ASIDE: Both girls were one-night stands and with both girls I had trouble finishing. Like I said, Stephanie was ridiculously tight so having sex with other girls, while enjoyable, was not the same struggle to last more than ten minutes that having sex with Stephanie was. The first one-night stand and I have sex for about two hours (not all at once, but yeah), and with the second girl I lose my erection entirely and can't finish.

Stephanie kept contacting me, about once a week, asking to hang out. She found out about the sex and was actually kind of happy. I think that she thought of it as a sort of ""getting even"" for us and that I would get over her cheating and not have the simmering anger underneath the surface whenever I would hang out with her. She called me up late one night and wanted to come over to my house. I waffled, and then relented. We ended up having sex.

Afterward, I felt confused about the whole thing. I talked with her about it and she told me she didn't want to get back together with me. I said that seeing her and being with her sexually was difficult emotionally for me, which she insisted she couldn't understand. We fell into a pattern where she would call me after a bad day, crying or upset or anxious, and I would either come over to her house or she would come over to mine and we would have sex.

After about a month of this, I was at a bar with my friends when a beautiful girl came in and sat down alone. I decided to talk to her, we strike up a conversation, really get along, and at the end of the night we kiss. A few days later, we went out and decided we wanted to start dating, and have sex. I told her that night that I still had contact with my ex, obviously leaving out the part about still having sex. I also told Ellen, the new girl, that the primary reason I was still in contact with her was because we were still on the same cell phone plan (which was true, but not the primary reason). Ellen said she was fine with that and was glad that I was open about it.

I told Stephanie the next day that I'd met someone and that because of that we couldn't have sex anymore. Stephanie flipped. She didn't scream at more or throw anything, but simply badgered me relentlessly that I shouldn't be dating someone else exclusively, or if I was going to, that Stephanie and I should still be able to have sex. I was forceful and said that we couldn't.

Almost immediately, Ellen pulled away from me. It was a combination of finding out about the ex and just being a closed person. She was also younger (22 to my then 26) and wasn't really able to express herself in a way that would have allowed us to work through any issues. We went on a few more dates, but it was awkward, and between those dates I ended up sleeping with Stephanie once more (without telling Ellen).

Still pining after Ellen, still upset with myself about being unable to drop Stephanie, I went to a wedding as the platonic date of one of my friends. While I was there I met Hannah, who was there with a date, and also happened to be an old friend of the girl who I had come to the wedding with. Hannah and I talked, but I didn't feel like we really hit it off, merely that she was a fun person to flirt with even despite the (oblivious) boyfriend. I didn't even give her my number, not thinking that anything would come of it.

A few days latter, Hannah contacted me on Facebook and we started hanging out. I told her about the things that had happened with my ex, and that I had to get off of the cell phone contract with her, and what had happened with Jake.  Hannah and I started fooling around, then having sex, then dating. We got along extremely well, and both of us had been through near-marriage relationships that ended by being cheated on. We both fell in love incredibly quick.

Stephanie was still texting me, but I held off her advances, and finally (FINALLY) got her into the cell phone store to get off of her cell phone plane. The next day Stephanie texted me, saying something like ""I just want to end it all."" I thought this was a suicide text, and immediately called her. It wasn't, I had misinterpreted. 

That text was the last straw, I talked with Hannah and I talked with my therapist, and told them both that I felt like the best way for me to get closure would be to tell Stephanie that I was blocking her number, that she had hurt me too much, and that I had found someone who made me happy and wanted to be with just her. She sent me back some rage texts before I blocked her number, and I moved on.

It may seem fast, but within a few months I knew something that I had never felt with Stephanie: I never wanted to look at another woman aside from Hannah. Flirting with anyone else held no value for me. The addiction I had always struggled with, fighting for affection from the opposite sex, wasn't cured but its edge was certainly curbed. I proposed about three months into our relationship. A few days later, we found out-- to our joy-- that Hannah was pregnant. Hannah and I have now been married for two months, and our child is due in August.

NSFW ASIDE: Hannah prefers me to be the aggressor in bed (and I mean AGGRESSOR in all caps). She's very specific about what she wants, and isn't afraid to be vocal if she isn't enjoying something. This was new to me on all counts, and there were times when sexually we weren't on the same page and I felt inadequate. It was at these times when I would fantasize about Stephanie sexually, with whom I had established a pattern of mutual orgasm and satisfaction. Now Hannah and I are on the same page, and we have amazing sex. She loves to do it multiple times a day, and lets me do pretty much anything I want to her. Her ass, it must be added, is amazing. But she is such a DIFFERENT lover than Stephanie, that sometimes I daydream about her.

I wouldn't be thinking about Stephanie at all, though, if it weren't for what happened before my bachelor party. My best friend had come up for the event; we hadn't seen each other in years and he was going to be my best man. His wife was still friends with Stephanie and he told me, shortly before my party, that Stephanie was pregnant with Jake's kid. It took me by surprise, and it makes me more angry than I have any right to be that, by my math, she got pregnant by Jake within weeks of that ""I just want to end it all"" text. 

I think he's scummy for cheating on and leaving his wife and kids and impregnating someone almost a decade his junior. I think he's scummy for having met me and still going after my then-girlfriend. I think she's scummy for not talking to me about why she really wanted to kick me out. I think she's scummy for using me for comfort (physical and emotional) between her spats with Jake and then jumping right back to them when I reneged on that comfort.

But mostly, I'm selfish enough and addicted to female affection enough that I'm most hurt by the fact that she isn't still crying to herself that I won't talk to her anymore, and that she decided some guy who would leave his wife and kids is a better partner than me. 

It shouldn't matter, I'm absolutely in love with Hannah and I am so excited for our child to come into this world. I have good friends, I have a good job, and in general things are going well for me. But for some fucked up reason, it does matter that Stephanie isn't crumbled in a heap because of me. Sometimes I feel as though I should have been an asshole, told her family (who still don't know the details of Jake's life when he met Stephanie) the horrible details of what she did to me, plastered it onto her Facebook wall so her friends could see, and just in general burn her. Sometimes I wish I could still have sex with her. Sometimes I wish I could punch her in the face.

I can't say that I'm glad that it ended. I still sometimes feel frustrated and lost in all of it. I feel as though if Stephanie hadn't cheated and we'd had our wedding that I'd been in a similar place to where I am now, with a similar level of happiness, so I can't say this was ""for the better."" 

But I'm happy now because I've found a wonderful person who makes me happy and makes me feel in love and loved every day. I've learned from my mistakes, and I treat Hannah better in those small ways than how I treated Stephanie-- doing little things for her even when she hasn't asked for anything, putting her happiness above my own.

There are no answers here, no advice that I'm looking for (though I'll take any if you have it), no assuredness I've received from my experience or that I'm looking to receive from posting this. I just needed to get it all down on paper and look at it, to see what's happened without frills or rose-colored glasses.

Thanks for listening.

**TL;DR: After 7 years, my gf left me for a married coworker who had kids. Then left him and slept with me. Then I found my wife and felt good. Then I found out my ex got pregnant from the married coworker and felt bad.**"

Story:

Over the summer I've been working a co-op job for my university education (basically an internship, but paid well). Since the job is in the middle of nowhere (Northern Alberta oilsands), I stay in a camp; what a glorious experience it is. There is a fully equipped gym right down the hall, and as much of the type of food that a professional bodybuilder would eat as I want; food already prepared for me.

I counted it today, and on an average day I'll eat about 4000 calories (340g of protein) from egg whites, cottage cheese, tuna, greens, fruit, meat, meat, and more meat, etc. For reference, I'm 5'10"" and 190-195lbs. I also brought some creatine up here; one scoop before and one scoop after a workout. The funny thing is that I don't even work out as hard as I usually do due to exhaustion from 12-hour work days. 1 - 1.5 hour workouts max.

I thought it was pretty fucking crazy for me to gain that fast, as I've never been one to make huge gains in short times. 

**So, what's the fastest you've put on weight, and how did you do it?**"

The software ran on a server, but you could ""export"" specific assets to an locally run program for more in depth editing then the web client allowed. The way the exporting worked was you selected which assets to export, and an email address to export them to. The address would then be sent a code that could be entered into the local program, which would then allow the user to download/upload data.


We also managed the data of most of our clients, and one of them had an issue. Somehow, several assets had spaces after certain words removed, which meant someone needed to go through them, figure out which where their should be spaces, and add them back. For obvious reasons, it was decided that I should be the one to handle it.


They didn't want to give me a login for their server, so instead several different users ""exported"" their assets to me, then one by one, i downloaded, fixed, and uploaded them. About half an hour after I finish, I get an email from one of the clients, asking why I hadn't uploaded the last asset yet (all assets are set to read only when exported).


I guess i must have forgotten to upload one of the assets. Nope, everything had been uploaded. Okay, maybe I accidentally skimmed over one of the emails, and never downloaded the asset in the first place. I check every code I had been emailed, each one had been completed. Is it in my recycle bin? Nope.


So I email them back ""I'm sorry, but I don't appear to have an email for that asset."" They tell me to double check, I do, no luck. They respond with a message to our technical support guy, ccing me, with our conversation attached.


""Techguy, DragonJTS is having trouble using the tool, can you help him please? See below for his problem"". 


He comes back a minute later with ""Client, I looked at the export logs. You exported that asset to yourself."""

A little background information:

I've been out of school for almost a year now and I haven't been able to land too many interviews. I've had my resume critiqued by my professor, engineering professionals, as well as friends. I guess it's time to see what Reddit has to say. 

As of today I've submitted 170 applications to various engineering companies and organizations throughout my state. I've had a total of 3 interviews. Company A was a one and done interview, Company B had me come back for a second interview but I didn't get the job, and finally the interview with Company C was straight up bad. I've also tried to apply to as many internships as I can but a lot of companies want students.

In regards to my resume:

* I had a crappy GPA (&lt; 3.0) so that's why it's not listed.
*  I didn't have any jobs/internships/research/volunteer work while I was in school (yes I'm kicking myself for not getting an internship; I had to take summer school practically every summer)

So the best I got from them was something between casual and business casual. (That's definitely what the women were wearing, some had jeans but it was still nice enough.) Any ideas on what that would be?? 

I tried looking at the other men for examples, but this company has 54 employees, 51 of which are women. Plus, the three guys were all in IT wearing jeans and tennis shoes.

Any ideas? Should I just stick with business casual? As an intern I figured it might not hurt to try and dress a little better in hopes of getting a job offer at the end."

I know each state is different, but perhaps you all can help me make sense of this.

It sounds like I would need to take the Praxis I and II, then get into an alternative route program (8-10 weeks), then get a 1 year internship, then get a job. That part I get. But the license is only good for 5 years? And then I need to complete CEU's? What are these? Do people who complete an MA of Teaching need to do this?

Honestly, the first five years would help me decide if I wanted to stay in teaching anyway. I'm not sure how good at it I would be, and having a bad teacher is the WORST. I wouldn't want to be the reason why kids don't like school. I'm also in a bit of student loan debt (who isn't?). So this would be beneficial in that regard also.

My goal is to keep it under $1200, which seems like I have done. Ideally, I would like to be closer to $1000. I will be overclocking sometime in the future, but not ""near"" future. My question is: am I overspending on anything? Is there any price reductions I can make in without sacrificing performance too much? 

I went to Microcenter today and found that they have

Crucial Ballistix sport 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory for $50. Is the $21 decrease worth it? Is this RAM terrible? 

I am also hoping to get a more portable case. I am moving in about a month for my internship, and moving (back) again in 4 months - so portability is very important. I would be willing to spend more for this. 

I also saw this: http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/thermaltake-case-vn40006w2n, a cheaper case and about 2 inches less w/l, which would be good. Any horror stories with this case?

A little background on the company:  they are a huge, world renown creator of high end computer parts and are very well respected. The only reason I am even being looked at is due to this referral - I have five years of work experience as a web developer, but well..  the internship pays equal (if not better) than what I make now and has benefits (which my job dies not).  Plus, it is this particular company on my resume with the possibility if a job there when I finish school.  I had applied for internships with them before and never made it to the interview.

So, as you can imagine, I am nervous.  I received word today that they will be bringing me in for an interview once they have a head count - I have no idea what that actually means.

Android and graphics - what should I look at for that?  And what does a ""headcount"" mean in HR terms?"

Hey all, after the success of my first post about the original 40 Champions I decided to continue the series. In this episode we'll look at the time period between launch and the end of the first competitive season, running from October 2009 to August 2011, nearly two years!

Because of the sheer amount of stuff I could talk about in that time, I'm limiting what this post covers; Nothing about bugs, champion balance or the high-end competitive scene. Removed content, such as a number of infamous items, will be covered in a separate installment.

And yes, I'm going to forget a few things. Please comment (nicely) if there's any interesting facts I left out!

----------------------
**Champions released during Pre-Season 1 and Season 1 (In order):**

(I'm not counting the original 40 champs - that post is linked at the top.)

(Pre-Season) Udyr, Nidalee, Poppy, Gragas, Pantheon, Mordekaiser, Ezreal, Shen, Kennen, Garen, Akali, Malzahar, Olaf, Kog'Maw

(Season 1) Xin Zhao, Vladimir, Galio, Urgot, Miss Fortune, Sona, Swain, Lux, LeBlanc, Irelia, Trundle, Cassiopeia, Caitlyn, Renekton, Karma, Maokai, Jarvan IV, Nocturne, Lee Sin, Brand, Rumble, Vayne, Orianna, Yorick, Leona, Wukong, Skarner, Talon


If they were organized according to their current positions in the SR metagame, it would look like this:

*Top:* Nidalee, Poppy, Pantheon, Mordekaiser, Shen, Garen, Akali, Olaf, Vladimir, Irelia, Renekton, Yorick, Wukong, Talon

*Jungle:* Udyr, Xin Zhao, Trundle, Maokai, Jarvan IV, Nocturne, Lee Sin, Skarner

*AP Mid:* Gragas, Kennen, Malzahar, Galio, Swain, Lux, LeBlanc, Cassiopeia, Karma, Brand, Orianna

*ADC:* Ezreal, Kog'Maw, Urgot, Miss Fortune, Caitlyn, Vayne

*Support:* Sona, Leona


And yes, I know certain champs like Kennen could go in other roles. Bite me.

----------------------

**Champion Pricing**

Poppy was released at the price of 1350 IP. She is the first and last champion to be released post-launch at that price point.

The vast majority of champions released during the game's first year were priced at 3150 IP. The last champion to be released at that pricepoint was Karma, at the very beginning of 2011. Since then, champions have either been released at 4800 or 6300 IP (Until recently when they became more expensive during their first week, though I would still consider them being released at 6k).

Only four champions have been released at the 4800 IP price point - Trundle, Jarvan IV, Orianna and Rumble.

----------------------

**Champion Trivia**

Nidalee is the only champion to have ever had an ability's cooldown reduction artificially throttled. Pounce (Cougar form's W) with enough CDR was deemed too powerful as it allowed her a huge amount of mobility and made her almost uncatchable. As such, Pounce was changed so that it was no longer affected by CDR. This change has since been reverted.

Ezreal's launch was... poorly received to put it mildly. He had a high learning curve and as such was perceived as being extremely weak - coupled with him being the first post-release champion priced at 6300 IP, his introduction into league caused a huge outcry from people who purchased him and felt they had wasted a huge chunk of IP/RP. This prompted Phreak (at that time an intern at Riot) to release the very first Champion Spotlight, detailing builds and strategies for Ezreal to show people what he was capable of - even scoring a kill on the mythical Jesse Perring.

Ironically, the current Ezreal is considered a strong pick, even though he's arguably weaker in almost every way to the launch Ezreal that caused so much backlash. Tier Lists FTW.

The first champion to have an auto-attack reset ability was Garen with his (Q)Decisive Strike. Before him, similar champion abilities such as Nasus' (Q)Siphoning Strike would simply apply on their next auto-attack, but Decisive Strike came out immediately once activated. It's still unclear if this aspect was intended behavior as it was removed and re-added several times in subsequent patches. The feel of Decisive Strike received a lot of positive feedback from Garen players, so Riot decided to add auto-attack resets to other similar abilities.

The first champion to be hotfixed for being overpowered was also the first champion released after launch: Udyr. After being in a rather mediocre state for a few months, Riot gave him a round of buffs but WAY overshot it. (Thanks to /u/2th for the correction!)

LeBlanc receives the dubious honors of being the first champion in the league launched in a state of such OPness that they hotfixed her a mere two days after her debut.

Lee Sin was also balanced with a hotfix within a week of launch, but for completely different reasons. Four days after he entered the League he was given a massive boost to all his AD ratios.

Another infamous character that had to be nerfed via a hotfix was... the minions. In March 2010 Riot had increased the late game power of minions in order to alleviate late game stalemates. However, when minions started taking down inhibitors unaided and even killing champions when in large numbers, Riot decided to tone them back a little.

----------------------

**Skins**

In addition to the annual Snowdown and Harrowing skins, there were a number of Olympics themed skins available in early 2010 to coincide with the Vancouver Winter Olympics. These include Vancouver Amumu, Team Spirit Anivia, Union Jack Fiddlesticks, The Mighty Jax, Festival Kassadin, Whistler Village Twitch, Curling Veigar and a legendary skin Ice Toboggan Corki.

In June of 2010 there were a several soccer/football themed skins available in honor of the FIFA World Cup, including All-Star Akali, Goalkeeper Blitzcrank, Striker Ezreal and Red Card Katarina.

The first several champions to be released after launch - Udyr,  Nidalee, Poppy, and Gragas - did not launch with skins. Nidalee would have a limited edition Snow Bunny Nidalee skin as part of the Snowdown Showdown shortly after her debut, and Poppy would have Noxus Poppy about a month after her release. The first champion to be released along with a skin was Pantheon, which was also the first champion/skin bundle for a new champion.

The first champions to have a combination champion/skin bundle were Teemo and Karthus, with their Phantom Karthus and Badger Teemo skins respectively. These combo packs were available for a very short time after launch.

The first skin to be retired from the store was Rusty Blitcrank, discontinued on January 17th 2010.

The first champion to receive unique splash art for their skins was Garen - All skin splashes before him were simply recolors of the basic splash art.

----------------------

**Maps**

Summoner's Rift originally had two different variations: The standard one and a winter themed one, which featured snow covered terrain and snowy particle effects. The winter version was further decorated for the Snowdown Showdown event to feature a host of Christmas-like decorations across the map. However a number of players reported performance drops on the Winter map, so it had mixed reception.

A Harrowing map was later added as a temporary alternate during October 2010, featuring spooky fog and orange/black brush, as well as a number of Halloween-like decorations. This map was so popular with the community that it later replaced the Winter version as the alternate version of Summoner's Rift.

Neither the Winter or Autumn maps are now available after the May 2012 graphical update.

A proposed map was revealed by Riot in September 2010: The Magma Chamber. Intended to be a new classic-style 5v5 map, Magma chamber was to be much bigger than Summoner's Rift and was supposed to emphasize spreading your team out to control the whole map rather than team fighting. The map also had an interesting aesthetic where half the map would be a cool, watery cave while the other half would be volcanic. After extensive playtesting, Riot decided to scrap the map for other ideas.

----------------------

**Lore**

Possibly the largest scale lore event that has or will ever take place was the Noxus vs Ionia Rematch. Hyped up for months by the Journal of Justice and Riot forum posts, it was fought on December 10th, 2010. A group of high-profile players were selected to represent each city state and selected their teams from a preselected pool of 10 champions corresponding to either side. The entire thing was done as a hardcore roleplaying event, with the casters even pretending to be Journal of Justice reporters - an example of this is when a player disconnected they said he ""was having problems with his summoner's orb"", and Roku (the team captain for the Noxus side) giving a post-game speech congratulation the Ionians on their hard won victory. The results of this battle were later made into a cannon part of the lore.

Demacia, despite being one of the biggest and most influential factions in the world of Runeterra, was totally unrepresented in the League until the release of Poppy in January 2010, who was an ambassador of the Yordles. The first true Demacian, Garen, was released in April of 2010.

An in-game news paper called the Journal of Justice was released periodically during Season 1, starting June 2010 and ending May 2011. It detailed the current events in the Runeterra universe, as detailed by a cast of fake media personalities. Besides providing updates on world events, it had a number of tabloid-like sections detailing the private life of League characters, interviews and Q&amp;A sessions with champions and a mailbag section where they'd answer player submitted lore questions. It was discontinued near the start of Season 2, as Riot stated they wanted to find a better way to convey the in-game lore.

Additionally, new champions released during season one had League Judgements written up about them. These detailed various champion's initiation ceremonies into the league, usually involving them reliving a pivotal moment in their life so that the viewing summoners could see their real motivations for joining the League. Judgements were released for all new champions up until the release of Graves, shortly after the end of Season 1. Since Graves, only Varus has received a League Judgement. Ryze also received a retroactive Judgement during Season 1.

----------------------

**Competitive Play**

It was originally intended that there would be a rotating pool of allowed champions for ranked play instead of having the entire cast available. The intent behind this was to reduce the number of champions a player would need to learn in order to be competitive and to adjust the champions available in case a particular strategy became too strong or popular. This idea has never been implemented however.

There was a battle of metagames between the North American and European server during the early stages of competitive League play. The NA style was more focused on late game team comps, where they'd place their AD carry in mid to farm up, AP carry top, have an aggressive initiator jungler and place whatever other champions they had bottom. This however led to a number of lost bottom lanes when facing against the EU style, as many times bot was just a ""throwaway"" lane where champions with little synergy or lane presence were put because they wanted them for late game. Ultimately the EU style of bruiser top, AP mid, AD/Support bot was adopted by the NA server as well and is still considered the standard team composition."

Need job advice.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ebmuz/going_back_for_a_masters_degree_in_accounting/,"I'll be graduating shortly with a degree in accounting from a university in the Northeastern United States. 

During my undergraduate career, I naturally applied for tons of tax internships (including Big Four stuff, plus some regional firms) and even had a few interviews, but I was a poor interviewer and nothing ever panned out properly for me. I've never gotten past the first round in most cases. Also, it didn't help that I didn't go to very many of the networking events they had on campus (my other jobs often got in the way).

Since then, I've gotten much better at interviewing and schmoozing with people, but unfortunately, these newfound skills came a bit too late in my case. 

Of course, I don't have a job related to accounting (still working a bunch of part-time retail jobs at the moment), so I decided to apply for and enroll in my university's MAcc program to get one last chance at on-campus recruiting this fall, get my thirty hours, and get a chance to sit for the CPA exam. 

Overall, my main interest is in tax, and at least for the networking events I've gone to, I've iterated this interest to a number of people. 

In the meantime, I've been applying for entry-level accounting jobs... But that hasn't been going very well, with a very low callback rate. I'm still waiting to hear back from one place (it's for an A/P position for a medium-sized software company), but I'm not very hopeful because I'm fighting at least a dozen other people for that one. 

Between now and the beginning of the fall recruiting season, what should I do? I've been thinking about reaching out to alumni from my school, setting up informational interviews with them, as my next step, in addition to applying for more entry-level jobs. How does that sound? One of my professors also recommends reaching out to recruiters as well, but I'm not sure how helpful that would be. 

**TLDR: I'm enrolling in a MAcc program in the fall, and need help figuring out my game plan towards getting a job offer in tax.**

*Addendum: If I am applying for jobs in the fall (with the Big Four et al), should I go for the winter internships, or go straight for full-time opportunities?*"
1ebmoc,1,2013-05-14,Got 700 for graduation...now what?,sexiibitch,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ebmoc/got_700_for_graduationnow_what/,"My initial thought was to put it towards bills to get them paid off faster. That way I can use the roughly 300/mth to put in a savings account to use for when I move out into an apartment in January with my SO. (Furniture, deposit, etc) 
But I'm beginning to wonder if I should just keep making my minimum monthly payments and tuck that 700 into savings now. 
For background, I have nothing in savings now because I barely make enough a month for bills and even then I scrape by sometimes needing to borrow for food and gas. Here's what I owe:
206/month for my car, I owe 1250 on it.
40/month on a closed credit card, owe 1090, this one has the highest interest.
40/month on another closed card, owe 1890 on it
Then I have my recurring bills (80/month phone, 85/month insurance, roughly 80/month gas)
My fear is that if i put it into savings now I'll start dipping into it for gas and groceries...I hate borrowing money. Then I'll be shit out of luck for when I move out.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, if you need more specifics, don't hesitate to ask. 

Tl;dr: pay off bills now or save now? Or something else I haven't thought of?

Edit: I need to clarify that I graduated college...not high school. I have lived on my own before and made it work, but had to take a lower paying job to complete an internship. "

I'm (F) not super heavy at 9 stone (for us Irish) and 126lbs. I'm 5ft1 and a little curvy. Not fat. Not skinny. Curvy. I hate what I see when I look down. It looks TERRIBLE to me. Looking in the mirror though is meh.

I have a little girl (5 yo) and an SO (who works nights). I work 2 jobs (office job interning for no pay mon-wed 9am-4.30pm) and a part time job (Customer Service Desk, standing 4 hours straight) which usually are the same days as the internship so I am literally out of the house from 8.30 am til 10.30 pm when I get home.

I proposed to my SO *SQUEE!* in March and the wedding is planned for May 2015. I am a size 10 UK (that was hard to type!).

This is not a blame game. I know I eat crap. I know I get convenience foods, use too much butter, love chips (or fries) and at the end of my days like to veg out infront of the tv for an hour then bed to repeat. I find the change happened when I switched contraception. I went from being on Implanon and feeling good about myself. Size 6, 7st. To Depro Provera and gaining the 2 st and 2 dress sizes in 2 years. My boobs are way too big and hoping to shrink considerably. Not unhealthily. Just back to regular me and toned wouldn't go a miss!

I have the motivation now. Joining a gym with a friend Thurs morning, so thats the exercise out of the way! 

Please guys, can you give any tips and hints to a girl who doesn't want to be like this.

My Mom is working night shifts and doing freelance work for other people. I feel incredible guilt because I was supposed to get a high paying job out of college but didn't, now she's still supporting me. 

I always worked hard in school because of my Mom's insistence even though I didn't like it, I thought that'd make her happy. Now I'm a college grad, first job out of college was online marketing, and I was fired from that. Did an internship and quit due to SA, now holding a minimum wage job. 

I always felt wronged as a kid because I saw that my parents didn't treat me as priority. Now I realize she's doing her best--my Mom paid half of my tuition and the other half was in loans. She did her best, even if she was yelling at me a lot, now I realize in actions she does care a lot about me. I feel so bad about this. 

In my head I've always wanted to be special, always wanted to be different. Now I'm really different, going against social norms and just harming my reputation left and right and not caring. 

I feel deep shame right now being who I am. How should I start? Get another job? Move and start over? Move back home and help my grandmother ( she is also depressed and living with my mother, but she's been there for me no matter what ). 

TDLR; I feel like the only person I really have in my life is my Mom, and I've done her wrong by not landing a high paying job or networking the right way during college. Should I get a job or move back in with her to help out with my depressed grandmother?"
1eb5in,5,2013-05-14,"I failed an exam because I panicked, and it ruined a semester's worth of work.",KrimsonAce,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1eb5in/i_failed_an_exam_because_i_panicked_and_it_ruined/,"Hai.

To begin, let me just say that I'm not a math person. Math has never quite clicked with me, and I've struggled with it most of my life. As part of my major (Computer Science, currently a sophomore), I'm required to take Calculus II. The only requirement is to get at least a C-.

Again, I'm not a math person at all. But I tried. I tried my ass off this semester, I studied extensively this semester, more than I've ever studied for a class. I wanted to do well, and to show that I could beat my problems. Before my final, I was sitting at a comfortable ~78%. Not great, but for me - I was proud. It's calculus II, one of the hardest math courses you can take. I'm not a math person, and I had a 78%. It felt good.

I studied about 5-6 hours a day in the week leading up to my final. I was struggling with the concepts, but I was working my ass off to understand. I started cutting back on sleep (to about 4.5-5 hours a night) so I could spend most of the waking day studying (quite literally 10-12 hours). I don't know if I burned myself out, or what, but the exam went horrible. I don't just mean it was rough, I mean it was absolutely terrible. I blanked out on most of the questions, barely got any final answers, and even forgot simple calculations that I had done plenty of times before.

I checked my grades last night, and I got a 42% on the final. Mind you, I had been studying, and I've been doing decently enough on midterms. But a 42%? That hurt. A lot.

I'm attributing it to panic, stress, and worry all culminating in one fuckstorm of an exam. I'm choosing to believe that I'm not actually an idiot - though I have no evidence of this. I had a panic session right after the exam, where my girlfriend talked me down and calmed me through 4 hours of rage, pissy fits, and flailing about. As a sidenote, I have to mention how much I love her for everything she does - keeping me level, carrying me through my emotional storms, and all else. She's absolutely brilliant, and I want to throw her a shoutout for that. Heh.

Anyway, I just wanted to vent one last time to get it out of my system. I'm forced to re-take the course over summer, where it's running me ~$742 out of pocket to re-take. Mind you, I'm a college student - I've got about $2.2k to my name. So that $742 really, really hurts (it's about a third of everything that I own). I'm also unsure about a summer internship at this point, because classes are tough to attend while also having an internship. We'll see, but the cost of me failing my exam is pretty damn high at this point.

**TL;DR: Not a math person, studied hard, was doing ok, then failed final because of panic and have to re-take course over summer.**

Final note: I have to re-take it over summer because otherwise, I can't graduate in 4 years (due to my next classes having a prerequisite of calculus II). At this point, I'm just bummed: I worked hard and it amounted to nothing (outside of a huge hit to my GPA), and an entire semester's work was ruined (as well as losing $742) because of 2 hours. 2 hours, one exam, and all that happened. 

Final final note: I have a history of stressing out and blanking during exams. I usually understand concepts well, and can teach them to others in class. I just freeze during examinations. I once took an accounting exam with my girlfriend. The night before, I had been teaching her all the material. As in, she didn't understand it and I was walking her through it. When we got the exam back, I had scored ~20% under her, because I got the information wrong (the information I had taught her the night before). I taught her enough for her to get it right, but I couldn't get it right myself. Does anyone know why this happens? I'm not even stressed as I go into a lot of exams, but I freeze anyway. I'd... I'd quite like to fix it.

No siblings, single parent. Latin, classics and advanced maths student. Play double bass in an orchestra and guitar in a band, also play violin and piano. Part time barista, intern at a restaurant. Read a lot. Tea drinker. Like anime, comics and other nerdy shit. Pessimist.

Her:
Popular, VERY popular. Extroverted. 173 cm, tanned. Brightest smile you will ever see. Drama prefect. Has golden retriever. Has older brother. Drama, chemistry, accounting student. Performs in musicals, plays netball and hockey. Lifeguard on the weekends. Interns at newspaper agency. Babysitter. Likes to watch movies. Coffee drinker. Extremely optimistic.

I'm an engineering student from the Netherlands in my final year. At the moment i'm following an internship at FishFlow Innovations. This company is making fish friendly passages, like an 100% fish friendly Archimedes screw.

Question:

The Archimedes screws are completely made of composite. We want to couple two cured composite parts together by putting a new layer of polyester laminate upon both parts. The connection between the cured composite and the new layer of polyester laminate doesn't count as a compleet composite part. The Polyeters resin will serve as a glue connection, because the polymers of the cured composite are completely done with the reaction and won't make any new connections with the new laminate layer. I can't find any information about the technical data of a polyester resin glue connection. Or is it better to prefab parts and glue the two parts with the prefab parts together with a better and stronger glue.

I hope you guys understand what I'm trying to explain, sorry for my bad English.

TL:DR: How strong is a connection between cured composite and a new layer of polyester laminate that acts more like a glue connection.


EDIT: I have chosen to use vinylester laminate, we are using Proxide Norpol 11 (for vinylester). We decided to not use prefab parts and glue the two parts togehter with the prefab parts in between, because of the glue surface. You can't guarantee an compleet glued surface but when we laminate the whole surface will be coverd. I added photo to carlify the situation (not the compleet parts just an portion of it).

I wasn't getting internship. I wasn't getting jobs. I got rejected from a job I loved. I felt isolated and alone, hating my body. To top it all off, the thing that sent me down a shithole spiral from whence I had come, was my boyfriend breaking up with me.

I'm back in the depression I was in before this whole thing. It's been a month since we've been together, but now I'm just so depressed. I met a few guys, one went back to his state, another is not talking, and the last has stopped talking to me and I don't know why.

For the past three days I've been having a consistent anxiety attack so I took a Xanax. Once it wore off I was back to panicing, but now it's more intense and I'm having major mood swings. It's impossible.

I'm just so upset and defeated. I hate who I am. I'm overweight, 21 years old, and now I'm doing poorly in every aspect of my life. I don't want to be alive right now.

Are these mood swings normal? Why can't I get over this guy? Everything seems so pointless. I'll never find another man that seems to like this fat worthless piece of shit that I am. I thought we were in love, but fuck, I feel like I was the one falling and he just watched it happen.

Update: The concenus seems to be that I was offered a low amount, thanks reddit. However, no one has seemed to answer my first question. Was I in a position to negotiate or just simply reject the offer and look elsewhere?

I am graduating soon(June),with a chemical engineering degree and I hate it. I came into school back in september 2009 and everyone told me how the great the major was, how fat our paychecks will be, how versatile our major is. I was told if I worked hard, I would have 1, or 2 job offers at hand before I graduate. Well whoop ti fucking do, I am walking in 1 month exactly and up to now nothing. I have a decent GPA ( over a 3.0), and its not like i hate my classes, ( I love process dynamics and controls , reactions engineering ) but fuck I hate the fact that I don't have a job yet. I couldn't get an internship last year but to make up for that( at least somewhat ) I researched with a grad student. I work hard,either for school, or just job apps,or some club I am heavily involved in that sometimes I don't have time for my own self. IT'S JUST SO FRUSTRATING, THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING MY ASS OFF FOR THE PAST  4 YEARS AND I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LINED UP AFTER I GRADUATE.  Fuck man, I hate to bitch and moan, and a lot of my classmates are in the same spot but god damn I will shoot you if you told us that we didn't work our asses off. There have been nights I went to bed crying cause mass transfer is just so damn confusing, or our lab was just giving us messed up data. But you better believe, I got back on the horse and made them my bitch. I just want a freaking job that is relevant to my major. Is that too much to ask? Fuck me. 

If ya'll are wondering if I have been applying to jobs, yes I have, since early october 2012, and up to now I had 1 phone interview. I apply to small companies, big companies, but no go. I apply on the website, via indeed, everything but no fucking go.

I've always been a little concerned over his low self-esteem. He frequently calls himself fat and ugly but has admitted that he does believe me when I contradict him and call him handsome, good-looking, and, well, he doesn't believe me when I call him fit because he's working towards a six-pack and doesn't have one yet.

Part of my concern comes from his family. His brother killed himself a little over three years ago, which he's sad about. However, he holds a lot of rage directed towards his deceased brother's girlfriend, who he blames for his brother's death.

About a month ago, he found out that he wasn't accepted to an internship he really wanted. He was absolutely crushed and talked all weekend about how he just wanted to die because he didn't get the one spot offered.

At that time, I told him I wanted him to talk to a school counselor. He laughed it off as if I was making a joke. Now he's getting angry and depressed again because he thinks he'll be getting a B in one of his courses from this term.

I'd suggest he talk to his pastor at home, who he is very close to, but his pastor moved out of the country. I can't suggest the counselor again with summer break starting within days and his family doesn't have the money or insurance to allow him to see a therapist. Is there any place/thing/ritual I can suggest to help him?

**tl;dr: I think my boyfriend of nearly two years needs to talk to a professional about depression and possible rage issues but can't afford it and doesn't feel comfortable talking to a stranger. What else can I suggest?**"

How can I make sure I nail these last 3 thirty minute interviews?",runtothesun,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ean4w/advice_needed_from_you_reddit_final_round_after/,"About to finish last few classes of my MBA (Top 30) by August with a very high GPA. I've interned for 1 year at a media/broadcast company (very well known). The way I for it was by meeting a guy a bar who is looking for a marketing MBA intern to look at TV ratings data and summarize findings/analysis. I interview and follow up. Likes me. Hires me. They like me while there. I stay another semester in market research. Then one more semester and move to brand strategy. I love it even more than insights so I decide to apply for a manager position in strategy. Have a year under belt, MBA focus in relevant field, great grades. 

Furthermore, i get along with the team real well. They always ask me to lunch and treat me like their work peer, despite being an intern. I work on strategy decks all the time and have become a ""go to guy"" for many directors in my department , bringing analytical and creative together and showing skillsets that some on my team don't have (excel and analytics). I introduce my own ideas, impress the directors and become close with then all. Come in early, leave late - never miss a day that I can work. All over the course of 12 months. All is good on my end.

6 weeks ago I intern with HR. They like me. Fast forward today. Find out I have a few more brief interviews with some members of my team and our no-bullshit VP. I feel prepared but what will they ask me in these 30-40 minutes? How can I absolutely nail it given that they now what I'm capable of and know how hard I work?

I see other candidates coming in and also interviewing and what scares me is this position prefers 5+ years experience and these people all have more than me since I'm relatively young. I only have 3 years, but 1 is at this company and I feel my MBA must count for something, right? Why am I nervous about this despite me being that typical internal hire who usually beats the outside competition? 

What can I do to absolutely nail these brief interviews? I am bringing a portfolio of my work and plan to let that do the talking and only answer what they ask me ( no digressing)

Is there any additional advice someone has to calm my nerves? This is the biggest opportunity if my life, I interview well, am friendly and very articulate - I'm just a bit freaked that so much is weighing on this because I've worked so hard over the last 12 months and am not sure about my competition.

Last week I walked into a small focused consulting firm asking to intern for them. It was a Friday afternoon (Receptionist left) so the person that I happened to meet was one of the owners of the company. He said they were busy and that he would take my resume and see if they needed me. Chatted VERY briefly about why I was looking to intern for them and he seemed interested in my resume. Said they would call me if they needed me this week.

I'm extremely interested in the type of work they do and I'd love to intern for them so I'm trying to be proactive about this. I would love to hear what you guys think my next step should be. I've found his e-mail (through some internet detective work of mine) and I'm considering e-mailing him to follow up. 

My other options at this point are to wait, to call or to personally go back to the firm again. I'm wary of e-mailing him because I dug up his e-mail and I don't want him to be put off by that, although I've already written something if I want to go through with it.

Things I have going for me:

* I have the background
* He's an alumni
* They look like a small firm (no hiring/careers page on their website)

I'm a student who did a few internships in banking so I have a decent understanding in valuation. However, banking is a lot of pitching so I didn't really learn how to properly analyze and follow markets.

Would someone mind listing a stock they researched well for me to analyze as practice? My hope is after I take a look into the company, I could briefly discuss my opinions (Long, Short, or Neutral) on the stock and then compare it with your ideas.

As i said, I'm a bit ignorant about past trends so I don't expect to wow anyone with my research - I'm just trying to learn! Maybe having an extra set of eyes will give you some new insights about the company as well?

During high school my mother cheated on my dad, and fell into a rapid downwards spiral of suicidal depression and alcoholism my senior year. After almost losing her multiple times to suicide attempts, losing a girl I cared everything about because she couldn't deal with my problems, and doing badly in school and football I became extremely depressed. I quit going to school for a month, lost a ton of weight, and wouldn't speak to hardly anyone. Eventually I just lost it, as I am a perfectionist and couldn't handle not being able to fix all of these uncontrollable things in my life. One night, I choose to crash my car into a tree I was so frustrated. At the last moment, I decided to slow down, and despite totaling my car emerged unscathed from the incident. It was the biggest mistake of my life and am something I am so ashamed of, since I am usually a strong person.That was two years ago.

My life started getting better a couple months down the line, when I found out I got into the university of my dreams. However, still somewhat depressed, I began smoking weed all the time as a way of escape. After a particularly rough summer where my mother got arrested for striking me and no longer being on speaking terms with her, I left for the university ready to begin my new life.

My first week at my university, I rushed the best frat on campus, and was offered a bid to join. Not really thinking about what I was getting into, I gladly accepted. This was the start of nearly two years of extreme drug and alcohol abuse for me. Starting with weed, I quickly moved up to hallucinogens, pills, coke, pretty much anything I could get my hands on. I would regularly drive drunk, and would black out multiple times a week. Eventually I stopped going to class, which of course resulted in me failing one of my courses. While this was all going on I forgave my mother and rekindled a relationship with her. It was probably the only good thing I had done in a couple of years.

Five months ago, I realized that if I continued to live the way I was living, I wouldn't live to 25. I'd been seeing a therapist for months for PTSD caused by my high school experience but I was ready to make the steps I needed to live. I moved out of the frat house, cut ties with all of my drug buddies, got focused on school again, and tried my best to fix my relationships with the members of my family and my old friends who I had neglected. 

Today, I sit here typing this post as almost a new person. I've been relatively sober since I started making these changes, got on anti-depressants, and am starting to feel like life is normal for me after so many years. I've gotten great grades the last couple quarters, have started making new friends, and got a great internship for the summer.

I've come so far, and I'm remarkably normal considering all of these things that have happened to me. I'm a very nice, good looking, sociable guy, who's just made some terrible mistakes and has had bad things happen to me. Most people don't even know about any of my problems, since I don't like to talk about them and I don't act like my life is so crazy. 

So today, I decided to write this post because it is something that I would never usually do. I'm the last person to talk about my problems, even to my friends I've known my whole life. But through all of these terrible experiences, I'm thankful that I've been so fortunate to turn my life around. So I guess I want to tell people my story, so they know that there's people out there who can relate and who turned their lives around and made things good again. This is the first time I've written a honest account of my experiences.

I'm 17, turning 18 in the summer, and desperately want to take a gap year to travel through Oceania and Southeast Asia (New Zealand-Australia-Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore-Thailand-Cambodia-Vietnam-Laos-Nepal-India) before college. I'd start in New Zealand or Australia with an internship for 3 months or so, and then I'd travel to another internship that would be either in Nepal or India. You should know that about 9 years I moved to another country and have traveled to numerous other countries (I'd consider myself pretty well exposed). But I think that is actually the reason for why I am so excited to see more of the world (I see it almost as my duty!). I am confident that I will be able to do this as well, I'm not just dreaming! On a side note, I have three sisters who have all done a gap year.

The problem is more or less that my parents think that it would make me too self-dependent. They're worried that I will have difficulty making a social life in college because I will have matured so much on my trip (this sounds like the crappiest logic ever). I'd see everyone as being too immature or something and would therefore have difficulty getting along with them. There is probably a more logical reason for why they don't want me to go on this trip but this is all they've told me. I find it especially strange that they're holding me back when all of my other siblings have done a gap year.

HOW YOU CAN HELP! What are good reasons for why I SHOULD travel, especially so young? Do you have any good articles? Examples of successful people who traveled young? Can you give me any inspiration for the regions I'm visiting? How about personal stories about life in college after gap year? And anything else you could think of is much appreciated!

---

P.S. Should I start in SEA and make my way 'down' or start in New Zealand and go up. I figured I'd start in New Zealand because of the season (starting trip around September) and to get used to traveling on my own in a country where I know the language. But maybe I should start in Nepal? I have some friend in SEA who will be there then so I'm tempted to start there.

EDIT: Thanks everyone! Awesome advice! I think I'll just keep figuring out the details of the trip and confront them with it. I know everyone is saying I should just run away, but they are my family and I don't just want to break off contact for this. As for financials, I should be more or less independent, but if shit hits the fan, it is my family who will be looking out for me."
1eaijq,202,2013-05-13,The Entitled Generation?,rantingthrow,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1eaijq/the_entitled_generation/,"I just came across the Time Magazine cover for the first time that refers to the ""Me Generation"", and decided I had to let out a rant. 

I've heard of today's 20 somethings referred to time and time again as the ""Entitled Generation"" and other similar demeaning labels. I think when I was on my way to university this label maybe fit. I was brought up thinking that the process was to get a degree, get an entry level job, and work your way up from there. 

However, in my second year, 2008, I realized that the job market was going to be a little bit harder to get into than that, so I started to work harder. I began getting near-straight A's, I became vice president of my university newspaper, I got a high profile internship in the federal government. 

At the tail end of this internship in 2011 I began applying for jobs but received nothing, not even an offer for an interview for basic administration jobs, so I figured I'll have to work harder. I sank tens of thousands into earning an advanced MSc from a top European school, thinking that might give me the edge to get me a job where my basic duty would be answering phones and typing reports. However, at the conclusion of this degree, I still did not receive a single offer for a job interview.

I ended up going to work in China, where there were jobs and where I could add experience that might just give me that edge. After one year here, with the bank all over me and my $700 a month salary barely covering my minimum payments, I've been back applying to jobs in North America again, still nothing.

I'm ranting about my frustrations because I know I'm not the only one in this situation. Those that graduated with me last year all appear to be in similar positions, stringing together internships in the hopes that they might just catch on with someone eventually. 

I don't expect anything to be handed to me, but I certainly don't feel that I deserve the title of lazy or entitled when I've spent the last 6 years of my life working my butt off for an entry-level position and neither do the hundreds of thousands of other people in my exact same position."

I know that this goes against a popular view that ""if you believe it's true, it's true for you."" When you say that, though, you shut down conversation and trivialize each other's reasons for holding those beliefs. And who really supports that view anyway? **Does anyone rally believe that, for example, facts about virginity, even in religious traditions, depend upon what we believe about it?

There is a strong campus presence from the Catholic (Newman Catholic Student Center, several CSC interns wander around campus) and the Jewish (Hillel, several Rabbis wander around campus) communities.

1eabqe,5,2013-05-13,Mrs. Silvir,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1eabqe/mrs_silvir/,"Being in an AP Psychology class, I've had to volunteer and interview multiple psychologists and psychiatrists in my area. These meetings usually followed up with writing a 5 page essay the night before it was due. None of it was ever interesting, the therapists I met with never had anything interesting to offer me. 
This was until I was actually offered an internship. Of course, I jumped at the chance, knowing how rare it was for a high school student to come across the opportunity of an actual internship in a field that I actually wanted to pursue. I accepted. The internship began late April. I was to go every Wednesday and Thursday afternoon.
It was a pretty small clinic for those who I can only describe as ""unable to function on their own"". I don't refer to it as an insane asylum as most of the people I'm around I find to be actually pretty normal, aside from the random bouts of anxiety or fear. Of course since I don't actually have any qualifications or degree to closely work with the patients too much, I'm usually just filing papers and running errands. But once in a while, Dr. Pinner (one of the head psychiatrists, also the one that offered the internship) allows me to sit in on a patient session.
These sessions usually consisted of me introducing myself and then sitting to the side and taking notes for a good 30 minutes to an hour. Most of the time the conversations I sat in on were uneventful, although I still enjoyed just being there. So far I’ve met with 6 patients. No need to tell you about the first five, since there’s nothing very interesting to say, but patient number six. That’s who I’m going to tell you about today in the hopes that I can find some comfort, or some advice I guess, too.
Last Thursday for the half hour before I was to leave (around 6 pm, I believe), Dr. Pinner once again invited me into his office. It’s become more frequent now, these invitations. I guess he thinks I’m doing a good job, but either way, I’m not sure I want to go back anymore. 
He told me that I’d be meeting a new patient. Mrs. Silvir. She had PTSD (although I wasn’t told what from), several phobic disorders, and severe schizophrenia. He left the room to bring the patient in, and I pulled out my phone to quickly check my texts (what can I say, I’m a teenager). As he came back into the room I jumped and shoved my phone back into my bag. When I looked up I saw Dr. Pinner holding the arm of an older woman. There was something uneasy about her, although I couldn’t really put my finger on exactly what it was. Her hair was dark and matted, but her eyes were light blue. So light blue…  almost white. It was kind of startling, in fact. Her shoulders were slightly hunched and she wore frailed, slightly dirty clothes. Her lips were thin, and dry. She glared at me with the weirdest look… I can’t even explain. Although I hesitated for a good 10 seconds, I mustered the courage to get up to shake her hand and introduce myself. “Hi Mrs. Silvir, I’m Presley. I’ll just be sitting in on this session, I hope you don’t mind. It’s really nice to meet you.” I reached out my hand and she pulled back. Her glare turned into a twisted smile. “Hi there Presley. Nice to finally meet you too.” Her voice was dry, quiet. 
Although this session was one of the most nerve wracking sessions I’ve sat in on, I’ll leave that for later. 
After the session, Dr. Pinner informed me that he just had to go consult with another nurse and that he’d be back in a minute. What he didn’t tell me was that he’d be leaving Mrs. Silvir with me. Alone.
She faced opposite from me, sitting in the couch, looking out of the office window. In an attempt to break the nervous silence, I tried to make small talk with her. Bad idea. “So I just wanted to make sure I have your name right. Mrs. Silvir, right? I’m pronouncing it correctly?” Her head turned slowly in my direction. She leaned in close to me. My skin crawled with unease. “I know who you are. You might not know me but oh, I know you sweetie.” Her voice was different. It was almost theatrical. Her words curled up into faint shrills. I didn’t know how to respond, so I just let out a nervous giggle and forced a smile. “I see you sleep at night. I see you trying to force yourself into slumber. But you can’t right? You think you see things in the dark. Such an innocent little girl. I see you turn on the lights when you think you hear shuffling in the corner. Coming closer… closer to the edge of your bed in the dark.” I was frozen in place. “I see you all the time. I saw you undressing yesterday. I saw your pretty new panties. All light pink and lacy. Even a bow to top off the pretty little girl.” She let out a giggle. “I see you everyday but you never seem to want to say hi to me. That’s not very nice.” Her voice turned deep, angry. “Oh and next week is your birthday too isn’t it. All grown up. No worries, I have a nice present for you. I’ll leave it where you can find it. I hope you like it. You better like it. It’s from me and I spent a good amount of time choosing it. Just. For. You.”
The door clicked open as Mrs. Silvir snapped back up, her face staring out the window once again, like nothing had happened. Dr. Pinner walked in and escorted her out of the office. I was shaking. I didn’t know what had just happened. I couldn’t move. Dr. Pinner walked back into the office and stopped midway. “Is everything alright? You look a bit shaken. I know that was a pretty heavy session…” “No, no. Nothing like that. I’m just tired.” I replied. “Oh, alright then. Well it’s about time anyways for you to be out, so why not just go ahead, I’ll sign you out.” “Oh… okay, thanks, Dr. Pinner.”
The rest of the night I spent going over that occurrence in my mind. I haven’t been able to fall asleep since then. And the scariest part of it all is that what she said was true… I do get scared at night. Like a kid. Probably mostly due to the massive amounts of time I spend on nosleep and creepypasta. And as privacy ridding it is to admit… I did have new panties…. Pink ones. 
I don’t know what to do. I’ve been looking over my shoulder uneasily for the past 6 days. And tomorrow is my time at the office, once again. I don’t know…. Please someone tell me what I should do.

1eabnt,1,2013-05-13,Cal. CPA Requirement Question,Hi__Friend,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1eabnt/cal_cpa_requirement_question/,"Hi r/accounting,

I've recently accepted a job offer from a public CPA firm (not Big 4), but I have a question about CPA licensure.  First of all, I am not an accounting major or minor.  I am an Econ major, but have taken plenty of accounting courses and did an internship last summer doing internal accounting for a private firm.  These two combined are what lead me to going into public accounting.  However, I am going to be 2 or 3 classes shy of being able to sit for the CPA after graduating.

I start work in July, so I was thinking of possibly just taking a couple online classes during the summer and fall before busy season starts.  My firm wants me to be certified within two years, so I think this is doable.  So my question to you all is, what is the best way of getting these final credits?  

Thanks in advance!"

My goal is to keep it under $1200, which seems like I have done. Ideally, I would like to be closer to $1000. I will be overclocking sometime in the future, but not ""near"" future. My question is: am I overspending on anything? Is there any price reductions I can make in without sacrificing performance too much? 

For example, I went to Microcenter today and found that they have

Crucial Ballistix sport 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory for $50. Is the $21 decrease worth it? Is this RAM terrible? 

I am also hoping to get a different case, maybe something more portable. I am moving in about a month for my internship, and moving (back) again in 4 months - so portability might be good. I would be willing to spend more for this. 

I would really appreciate any feedback. I'm real nervous since it's my first time! Thanks in advance.

1eaa74,3,2013-05-13,How bad does a period of unemployment look?,champyg,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1eaa74/how_bad_does_a_period_of_unemployment_look/,"This question is posed mostly to anyone in a hiring position.

I'll be graduating with a BS in EE in a week. I have a pretty strong resume in my opinion. 3.7 GPA, 2 internships (Southwest Power Pool and Intel). I'm currently waiting to hear back from a company that does the same work as SPP, except in a different region. I currently seem to have pretty good luck getting calls back on applications, and do very well with interviews. But here's my problem...

I'm having doubts about jumping straight into the daily grind. My heart has lied in music much longer than it has in engineering (implying that an engineering job would even involve real engineering). Ever since starting college, I've had this pipe dream of graduating and taking some time to explore playing music full time. I have plenty of money saved up from my two internships, and my school was paid in full by scholarships so it's not like I have any debt dictating that I go make more money than I need at this point. I might have the opportunity to play drums for an already established touring band in the near future. I'm heavily considering it. Do any hiring professionals or engineers who have similar experiences have any insight as to how bad doing something like this could hurt my career outlooks in the future?

So tl;dr: How bad could I hurt my future careers prospects by taking some time to explore my real passion, music, immediately after graduating college with strong credentials?"

Interestingly I think it was triggered by cannibis when I tried it the first time. Over the year it been getting worse and worse finally I asked my mom to go see a therapist. I told  my parents that I'm scared about going to college or some bullshit, hopefully I can tell them the truth soon. 

I've seen her twice and everything has rapidly changed. The second visit she told me my feeling of anxiety were closer to obsessive compulsive behavior. I never thought of OCD but I do have very OCD like habits, but ive always have had unexplainable discomforts, carried by obsessive thoughts.  I think it makes much more sense.

On Wednesday day when she ""diagnosed"" me (which I do not think was official but she exclaimed, ""diagnosing is an art"", so whatever) I was relieve to have some kind of label on, which I knew was not normal. This past weekend has perhaps been the strangest couple of days in the past year. I'm glad I have been diagnosed, and felt like I'm getting much better so I restarted nofap which I highly recommend.

I spent Mother's Day with my mother, then I went home to watch a movie called Mind Games which I also completely recommend, (http://youtu.be/XzQTttuWSQA) it's not typical Japanese anime, but it is weird. It changed my thinking and perhaps blew my mind. Thoughout the weekend I have been experiencing what I can only call a euphoria. Like a rush of dopamine. When I went to bed I could not sleep. After I while of losing myself in straight thinking I fell on my ass and experienced the worse episode of sadness and worthlessness yet, but then back to euphoria. At this time it was 4 am and I needed to get up in 3 hours, so I fapped and that finally let me sleep. My eyes are blood shot and I feel delusional yet ecstatic about life/ high on life sitting in a desk at a job internship in a hospital as I wrote/am writing this. 

If anyone has any similar experiences or experiences with OCD I would like some clarity. If anyone a word other than euphoria, I don't like that word and it doesn't quite sound right.

She went in for a ""hand shake"", but I was so wrong, instead of grabbing my hand she grabbed my bicep and squeezed several times commenting on my Brodin given body. As she held her hand there I could feel every pulsating movement her fingers made as it made contact with my bicep without consent.

I was working as a manufacturing intern which focused a lot on quality and process issue within the company. I was just not happy there and I couldn't bring myself to work there after graduation. It was just that people the engineers I worked with did not seem too motivated and I don't think there was any potential growth for me in the future for me. I was at this internship for about a year. Never the less I learned a lot and got some great experience. 

So I have been applying ever since to various jobs and still haven't been able to land any interviews. I know people have it way worse than me from searching and reading posts on /r/AskEngineers and /r/engineering I have two engineering internships (a year in each) the first one being one that I really liked. Unfortunately there is not a position available for me at the company where I got my first internship.

Any advice on what I should do or where I should be applying? Id really love a position in the automotive industry since its what I did at my first internship. I'm in CA but Im willing to relocate anywhere in the US. 

 I think I may also need some advice on my resume. I wouldn't want to post it but I can PM it to someone if you want to help me go through it.

Lately I've been bitten by animals. Within the last 2 weeks, I was bruised by the bite of a cockatoo, bitten aggressively by a feral cat, and last night my dog was being particularly mouthy.

With the cockatoo, I feel the lesson was to stand my ground when being attacked and not to react violently as that only perpetuates more attacks.

However, because these bites and mouth encounters keep happening, I'm wondering if there is a greater lesson here.

Some background, I'm 23f, just graduated college, got a really good internship, and broke up with my boyfriend, all of these changes happening within the last month.

What do you guys think? Are there any spiritual meaning resources I should know about? Thanks in advance for your kindness and help.

After a very fulfilling few years in college internships, which gave me a great resume, I have found my first full time position in an institution of higher education.

However, the office environment/morale is extremely negative, the person who works above me is not the best manager or communicator (little training compared to the complexity of the tasks at hand), and I'm 100% sure I don't want a career in my particular department in higher education.  The problem is I started in January of this year and I'm worried it will look bad on me to leave after a few months and also that my employer would be extremely upset-even though I'm sure they think I'm a bad fit for the job. I have offered to help out colleagues in other departments to widen my skill set while I'm here. Realistically speaking, I couldn't leave any time soon but the thought of staying here another year just squashes my soul.

On top of all of that, the person above me (my unofficial boss) got into a screaming match with our head accountant because he wanted her to lie to the IRS by signing as a third party appraiser on a transaction conducted between our university and an individual making a non-monetary donation. The accountant was very alarmed, refused and told me to speak to her if this ever happened again. After that I have no idea if I can trust him even slightly, if he was willing to break the law so carelessly. How can I protect myself from becoming involved in those kind of semi-illegal situations? If I can't even trust the people I work with the most will I be able to make a significant contribution to this employer, or am I just wasting my time?"

Some were just on the phone, so I can't even blame it on being too fat or too old. 

The wind is blowing. It sounds like the ocean. Or like shushing, telling me to not worry, to relax, that I'll be okay. But I really don't think I will be this time.

Bitching on the Internet has done nothing for me, but because I know there's nowhere else to go I might as well engage in this behavior.  All the pain, all the loneliness and all the nothingness has taken its toll on me.  My enemies have won, they've finally conquered me, though it took them years they ultimately won this war of attrition.

At first I thought, “Maybe Reddit can really help me, like give me exactly what I need to fix things,” but it's pathetic of me to even think of such nonsense.  And before anyone says to me, “You have to help yourself,” I personally hope your kidneys get ripped out for even uttering such words.  I'm not a superhero, nobody is, and I've helped plenty of people throughout my life...I haven't gotten the same in return.  Nobody can make it in this world alone, and those who do sacrifice too much to be considered “persons” anymore.

Maybe it's the way I look, maybe it's my aura, maybe it's just how I am, but for whatever reason people just don't want to give me that helping hand.  Not friends, not family – nobody!  I wish someone would tell me why I don't deserve this, is it because I'm unlikeable, am I unattractive, am I stupid, do I give you a bad feeling?  Now I know this is the part when somebody thinks, “Nobody deserves anything,” yes, let's think that way, so our society turns into all of us living in selfish bubbles instead of a functional, adapting community!

As a matter of fact, I'm so against the notion of our species living in self-serving, blissful bubbles that I've sacrificed things in the hope of fixing this problem.  I once had a dream that would bring me happiness, but shit happened and I'd much rather do something greater.  The only problem is my words are empty as I've got nothing to start and nobody by my side.  I know what I want to do in my extremely long-term goal of changing the world, but I don't care anymore about taking that first step.  And honestly, why should I when this journey is so soul-sucking and lonely?

My only way to cope with things is to not think about them, to ignore them – and I'm sick of doing this.  For the past few days I've been watching these TV documentaries about famous mobsters, about how cold, calculating and efficient they are, how machine-like they are – am I going to have that kind of mentality in a few years?  No, I won't commit any crimes, but will I only care about money and power while not being capable of knowing love or affection?  Due to my coping mechanism I'm already emotionally-detached, or “dead on the inside” as I like to call it...AND IT FUCKING SUCKS!

It seems the only way for me to survive is to become more machine-like, to lose all my humanity until there's nothing there, until I don't care about anyone or the world around me long as my goal is achieved.  The only reason why I'm such a failure now is because for years I've been trying to stop my soulless conversion from happening.  Some days I wish I was truly a machine so at least I would get things done, rather than being the worthless shell-of-a-human I currently am.

Everything is pretty bad for me.  I have no job and sure as hell won't get one after being unemployed for 9 months, jobs I'm qualified for won't respond, retail places never contact me, temp agencies have been no use, part-time places won't contact me, some internships won't even contact me.  Sure, I can volunteer and maybe if I'm lucky after a few months that will turn into a job, but the world runs on money and not goodwill.  Aside from that, I'm too prideful to play this stupid game and be at the mercy of employers.  Honestly, I'd rather die broke than kiss ass for that first paycheck.  You can disagree with my attitude, but if more people thought like me instead of being ready to bend-over-backwards shit wouldn't be this bad.  

Oh, but it gets worse because I'm 28 and I still live with my parents – I'm just a loser all around!  Sorry, there's no paragraph here because that one sentence says enough.

Aside from being an unemployed loser, I'm completely unfulfilled emotionally and physically.  I know women read this subreddit, and they certainly don't want to be with someone in my shoes.  They'd much rather be with someone who's got stability and structure rather than someone with nothing.  Hell, I'm sure I'm one ugly-motherfucker, because nobody has ever said I look attractive.  But don't worry ladies, when my soul is finally gone and I truly become a machine, I'll use y'all for sex than throw you away when I'm bored – it's not because I'll hate women, it'll be because I truly won't care anymore.  

Some people here might try to give me advice, but don't bother.  Unless you can actually do something real for me, something useful (and I bet you can't because people who know me in real life sure as hell can't) your words are empty.

1eev1b,2,2013-05-15,Summer housing options for subletting?,[deleted],washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1eev1b/summer_housing_options_for_subletting/,"Hey everyone! I searched but there hasn't been a post like this in a year, so I thought I would go ahead and ask. 

I'm coming in to DC to intern this summer (like a million others it seems) and am looking for inexpensive housing options. There's another person from my grad program also looking so we would be willing to room together as long as the place has a kitchen. I've been looking at the different universities for summer housing options but a lot of them don't have cooking facilities and it's impossibly expensive to eat out for every meal for ten weeks. 

I searched craigslist and nothing really popped out. Is there any secret summer housing that locals know about? Advice for fighting against the hordes pouring into DC to work? I'll be working at a place right by the Farragut North Metro stop, if that helps as well. 

Thanks and I can't wait to be in your lovely city this summer!"

I have about a week and a half before it starts and I was wondering what stuff I should brush up on to try and lessen the learning curve for myself. When I had interviews, they asked if I knew how to manipulate pivot tables in excel so I would assume I should know that pretty well. But what other excel type things or any other programming type things should I brush up on before heading for day 1? If it helps it is with a casualty reinsurance company and from what I can tell I will be doing a lot of data mining. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it."
1eetth,7,2013-05-15,"Am I (19/M) being out of line and clingy, or is she (19/F) being distant, or neither? (Neither is very possible I think)...",AmIClingy123,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1eetth/am_i_19m_being_out_of_line_and_clingy_or_is_she/,"We met in college in the same town just over 6 months ago, but we are originally from towns about 100 miles away. The first 6 months were the best thing I have ever been lucky enough to experience. She is my first GF but I am not her first boyfriend. We have spent the past 6 months beyond happy together. The one issue we seem to have is me not giving her space.

Example: A few weeks ago she was stressing over a project and kept declining my requests to meet up or not answering my texts right in a timely manner. I asked if me and her are okay and if something is wrong. She said she just needs space, and that I need to stop being so clingy and that just because she doesnt answer me right away doesn't mean she doesnt love me. We were golden for the next few weeks. I was giving her space, and after spending a 4 day weekend with her she even told me that she's amazed at how well I've been doing with the whole space thing.

So...what's the problem? Well now it's summer, we arent living 5 minutes away but instead about a 2 hour train ride from one another. I already started my summer job and she's working part time until her internship begins in a month. Normally she answers texts within 20 min at the most when we are at school. Since we got home it was 45 min, sometimes over an hour. I would send a text every 30 min or so telling her something different or asking what she's up to (Nothing pushy, im not concerned about what she does in her free time), and eventually she kind of told me to back off again, she said ""You just have to realize that some days I might not be able or want to answer you right away. We skype at night, we don't need to text every two seconds or even every hour"". Alright I got the message, and the past couple of days I've tried backing off. I wont be able to see her for another 3 weeks but we found out I can take one day off next week, any day of my choice. She's working 4 days (She finds out which tomorrow) so i thought it would be perfect for one of us to take the train and visit the other. But she keeps saying she doesnt know if it will work out or not. Don't get me wrong, I saw her last week and it isn't a must for me to go visit, but we have a chance to see each other and I'm just wondering why she doesnt seem to want to take it...3 weeks is kind of a long time and after that she starts her internship and it will be at least another 3-4 weeks before we get to see each other again...
So my question is, am I being way too clingy, or is she being distant, or is it just my clingyness driving her away?"

1eeorh,1,2013-05-15,I feel like my life is on pause,MPDPsycho,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1eeorh/i_feel_like_my_life_is_on_pause/,"Last year I graduated from university. Everything seemed to be great, I managed to get myself an internship at the university, and they would fund me to do an MA course. I was optimistic about the future and couldn't wait to start, but now everything seems to have fallen apart.  

While I enjoyed the MA lectures, I found it harder and harder to complete the work or assignments. I'd do my best to sit down and do them, but come the day before they were due in I'd still be unable to focus. I'd find any excuse I could to do something else, even when I literally had an hour left to finish I'd write about 20 words before my mind wandered and I'd start clicking around online.  

I've always gone through periods of feeling down, but they never lasted too long and I always seemed to bounce back. This has lasted for months now though, and has slowly seeped into every aspect of my life. Things I once enjoyed now seem pointless and a chore, I'm a huge film fan and now find it hard to sit through anything without the urge to switch it off.  

My internship ends in a couple of months, but I've done nothing to find employment afterwards. The lease on the house I'm sharing is also up soon, and while my housemates have found accommodation I have again done nothing. I just want to disappear, when everything is a struggle it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. Not to the extent that I want to text my life, I just don't want to have to exist anymore.  

I've been thinking for a while now that I should seek help, but the thought terrifies me. I wouldn't know where to start, and I feel foolish even claiming I'm depressed when there are people out there with real problems. I have a job, a house, a degree, girlfriend - really I have nothing to complain about. That's what makes it so hard to admit that I'm so down about everything. I don't think my friends and family would understand.  

If you've taken the time to read this, then thank you. Sorry if it isn't entirely clear, it's difficult to organise my thoughts at the moment. I'm just glad I've at least written down some of what is bothering me. "
1eeokb,3,2013-05-15,It's only been a year... (reflective post inside),[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1eeokb/its_only_been_a_year_reflective_post_inside/,"I'm abroad for part of this summer, so on my flight over, I came to thinking a lot (and am now going to blabber because I want to share). I'm surprised - I've changed so much in so little time. In the past year as a second-year at college, I've not only found out a lot about myself as a person, but I've come to embrace who I am.  

Last year when I started school, I was overly socially aware. I thought everyone was looking at me always. I was convinced that everyone was looking at me, saying negative things about me; even if I were just getting lunch from a dining hall, I believed that classmates were thinking that I was a loser with no friends. Now, I have changed. I am less socially anxious (though I still have my insecurities, though I am working on them), I’ve learned to not care about what others think as much - not just convincing myself that I don’t care, but actually not being affected by my anxiety. I've started to embrace everything about myself. I am an introverted person. My idea of fun is to sit outside and read a really good book. I've come to understand that I don't need to change that about myself. I've always over-stressed about having friends, thinking I need to be more outgoing but honestly? Not true. I have my very close friends, intro- and extroverts alike, and they are the most amazing people I have met. They push me to be a better person, do things I otherwise might not, and accept me for myself as I am. They're honestly inspiring.

I've always assumed I was just not a passionate person and so would never be really into anything. This semester, I took an anthropology class I was close to dropping due to the high level and ridiculous workload, but decided last minute to keep it. It was life changing. Not only did I find something I LOVE, but I've gained a new respect for my capabilities as a student and writer. I've never thought of myself as good at anything or able to take on a big work load, but with the extensive amount of reading and writing required for this one class, I garnered a new appreciation for my talents. 

A few months ago, I had no idea what I would be doing over the summer. All around me, classmates were getting positions in the DC area, medical centers, other amazing research opportunities. I had been eying an internship forever, yet due to my over thinking, forgot to apply until two days late (I can be a perfectionist and thus was still working on my cover letter the day I realized the application was late). Through networking, I was able to move my application to the top of the pile. And even though I was late, I got the position at an ivy league institution. I also got asked to hold another awesome internship position. I never expected things to pan out as amazing as they did.

Today, I got an email from the studies abroad office at my school informing me that I had permission to study at my dream school next spring (which they don't usually grant since I want to study at a university that does not have the same mission as my small liberal arts school). I had submitted the application in the midst of hell week, yet was determined to do it. And it all worked out.

Though I still have a long way to grow both personally and academically, I am really ecstatic about the amount of positive change that has happened in just the last year. I know a year sounds like a long time, but it really hasn’t felt that long at all. I’m still in awe over how much I’ve developed as a person, and am really excited to see what else is in store in the future.

I know this was a long post/bit of a brag but I just wanted to share. For all those struggling right now, one thing I have learned is that things work out. Things will fit together eventually, just keep pulling through. Had anyone told me last year that all this would happen, I would have laughed. Never would I have thought that I would have such amazing opportunities as I ended up getting - nor would I have thought that I would find something that I love. I am confident that things will work for you too. "

Thanks for clicking on me, I'll try my best to keep your attention. This is my first time using this but I think I understand it enough to find someone who finds me interesting.

I'm a 20 year old guy living up in a suburb of the Twin Cities. Exciting, right? Probably not, but I like Minnesota so I guess it works out well for me. I'm tall. 6'2"" to be precise. I'm also thin and reasonably attractive so I guess I have that all going in my favor. I can't describe myself because I feel like I only focus on the positives or negatives which are completely subjective so if you want a picture, just ask, I'll be more than happy to let you decide about my appearance yourself.

Anyways, my personality. This is what should be most important. I'm a nice person. Overall good guy, but don't get me wrong, I love to poke fun at people and you know what, I like to be an asshole sometimes (in a friendly way, does that make sense? No? I don't know, I'm tired, nothing really makes sense). I think I'm relatively smart. I am very forgiving, understanding, and down to earth.

So you're probably asking yourself, ""So what's this guys deal? If he seems so normal, why can't he find friends on his own?"" Good question. Unfortunately for me, I was unable to find an internship whereas the majority of my good friends traveled across the country to begin their work as interns. So here I am, left alone back at home. Kind of lonely but I'm hoping you can change that!

As a true Northerner, I enjoy snowboarding. I'm not going to pretend I'm some god, but I think its pretty relaxing to just cruise down the slopes and take in the atmosphere and scenery. I like to go on adventures too. Just going on walks on trails or wading in a river, its just so cool.

I can get along with just about everyone. I really like that about myself. Meeting new people is always something I enjoy. Although, I hate the awkwardness that usually happens when you try to figure out whats okay and not okay to say with people so lets just say everything is fair game. I won't judge and I'm certainly not offended easily.

Look. I'm tired. I'm kind of lonely. I just want to meet some people to do stuff with. I'm single and ready to mingle. Yeah its cheesy but I'm tired, who really cares? Do I expect a relationship to come from this? No. Am I open to one if we click? Yes.

I'm down to text. I'll be busy most of the day, but I promise I'll respond to each and every message I receive on here when I log on next!

I am a programmer that will be finishing up my CS undergrad degree next year. I was hired as a contract programmer for a startup. Another friend of mine was also hired at around the same time as me so we are the first workers there besides the founders. The current state of the company is we have operational funds for the next 6 months already lined up, a couple potential licensing/consulting agreements we are following up on, and are in early talks with several more investors who seem to be very interested.

So far it has been a great deal for a college student with flexible hours, competitive pay even compared to good computer science internships in the area, and I have learned a lot. Lately the other programmer and I have been questioning whether our work is being valued appropriately within the company. 

The cofounders were technical founders, but after me and my friend started working the technology quickly grew beyond their abilities. I personally have come to take control of a lot of product management responsibilities and have the final say in design and development decisions.

Me and the other main programmers compensation for our work has been around $20 an hour in addition to $20 an hour in options each. Over the last year or so we each have acquired options for roughly 0.75% of the shares of the company. The founders and even advisors who only help us occasionally have significantly more.

I don't want to cause equity struggles within the company, but I want to get some idea as to whether my work is getting fairly compensated so that if the company grows I'm not tossed aside or cheated. The going rate for a developer with my particular skill set is a six-figure salary, granted I don't have the experience or credentials to command that kind of salary, but I think that I would be close and for sure more than I currently make. 

To me it looks as if my work may not be valued appropriately, but because I have no idea how people are usually compensated using equity and options I have no idea how to read my situation. Does this seem like a reasonable compensation to other redditors out there? If I was to have a discussion with the founders about the value I add to the company what should I say or ask about to help. Any advice from people who were early hires at a start up?

Sorry for the vagueness, but I would rather not post identifiable information on here for obvious reasons. Thanks for helping me out!

*TL;DR*: What is a fair share of equity/pay for an early tech-startup hire?

1eed96,2,2013-05-15,Any Government Assistance for Un-paid Internships?,[deleted],canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1eed96/any_government_assistance_for_unpaid_internships/,"I have been looking for work in my field for almost 2 years. I finished school five years ago. I am 26, and entirely on my own. I have the opportunity now for an unpaid internship (its for a design show), and I think it sounds like a lot of fun, and a great opportunity. Sadly I won't get paid. But the experience and networking might be worth it. 

But I cannot afford to not work, is there any government assistance in Ontario for people who are interning? 

I do not have the option of living at home.



EDIT: It would seem that there is a small possibility that it is illegal for them to have this ""intern"" position, as per the Ontario Guidelines. However how would one approach such a topic to the potential employer? Would you wait until your hired? Or mention it at the interview? I would assume if you did they would probably not hire you.

Unfortunately I won't have a car out there which means that unless I can carpool with someone I won't be able to get in any fishing this summer, which would mean missing the great cicada hatch.

If anyone else is located in the Boston area who wouldn't mind an extra companion on a trip or two, please let me know.  I am more than willing to pay for gas and/or beer, and am a pretty outgoing guy who is easy to get along with.

I have been in and out of college for 10 years (god sounds terrible writing that).  I've held good paying and high experience qualifying jobs throughout, management, using excel etc.  About a year ago I found out about being an actuary and got into it.  I studied on my own and passed P and am sitting for FM in August.  I am also currently in a summer internship with a large insurance company.  I am still probably 2 full years away from actually getting a Bachelors in actuarial science.  I know that passing exams and getting experience are the biggest factors that people look for.  Is it possible that with multiple exams passed, an internship, and lots of other relevant experience I could get into the career without the degree or am I looking at definitely having to wait the two more years of schooling to get going?

tl:dr - Multiple exams passed, internships and experience in field but 2 years from degree, do I have to drag it out those two years before getting a job?"

The idea is to create a non profit organization in which we make dreams come true, it'll be called The Dream. We take donations and put it towards someones dream, no matter how big or small they will be somewhat randomely picked. Everytime you want to submit your dream, you would have to donate a dollar, USD, or more if you'd like. Since my dream, is to help other people fulfill their dreams, I think this would be great. However, we need a website to start off, so I was wondering if anyone would be willing to make us a website? I would try to pay you as much as possible, but since this is a charity, it would b hard. After getting off the ground, when we start getting noticed more, you would be getting paid, and it would basically be a job. So consider this an internship, I suppose. Anyone want to?

1ee9mk,1,2013-05-15,Summer Solstice + Self Love= Your Recipe for Happiness,mrisa,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ee9mk/summer_solstice_self_love_your_recipe_for/,"The celebration of the relationship between our sun and planet is around the corner. Let’s emulate how ancient cultures show appreciation for this time by honoring the love within us.

Throughout time, songs have been sung, poems have been composed, and volumes upon volumes have been written about Love.  Without a doubt, love is as critical as air and water.  

So this Summer Solstice, Beyond Body Mind Spirit (BBMS) invites you to explore and expand your world of Love into Self Love.   Try this exercise. 

Right now close your eyes for a moment. Visualize your body as a gateway opening to release the thoughts and feelings within you.  Now ask yourself, “What does happiness mean to me?”  Take a few moments.  Allow every thought and feeling to be expressed, using whatever device is at hand.

When I tried this exercise, I realized the majority of my responses were about my desire to help the other people in my life. I believe this is an admirable quality.  Perhaps you, like me, were taught,  “do onto others …”  as children.  Yet as I read through my list of answers, I realized what was missing was how I create my own happiness through my actions towards me.

And that’s what BBMS asks you to consider- all the ways to support you, care for you, make wiser decisions for you, have compassion for you, and unconditionally love you.  As my experience suggests, learning how to love yourself requires these quiet moments and a teacher to help you explore what’s inside. 

Self Love is just ONE aspect of happiness.  At BBMS, we help you “Enjoy Healthy” in its fullest sense and add yoga, meditation, and nutrition.  

Over the next few weeks, I will explore the other 3 aspects with you. 

So begin by commenting about your thoughts on happiness to keep this conversation going.  Then infuse your vision of happiness into your Summer Solstice practice and revel in your creation.

P.S. Add your comments and let’s blow the roof off our experience of Self Love. 

P.P.S. Like us on Facebook.

1ee99r,5,2013-05-15,Career change failed,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ee99r/career_change_failed/,"Hello Redditors, this is my first post and I'm here to complain about my life. Here goes:

**History** I have a degree already in OR, but never got to use it because industry wants either an H1 or charm+wit. I stupidly never pursued honours, mostly because I was kicked out of the nest right when I needed them most- whilst studying.

I spent a while in web dev, but got walked all over by a shit boss (boss's ""best mate"" actually - the directors were alright) with a history of burning out employees. It was my only option to get work experience in coding. I could've kept doing it if it were just business systems, but the small-time clients with miniscule budgets and champagne tastes for elaborate shopfronts turned me off. I can't stand the lame web-enterprise end of software engineering (if you could call it that).

**Problem 1**  Now I'm on a BEng in Surveying and I'm 30ish. I would like to think that age doesn't matter in this regard, but it does. I started off ambivalent towards the subject matter but since then I've discovered I was naieve and that the lecturers were better at marketing than actual teaching. Basically it was as an escape for said previous career and now I hate it. Plus, although my marks are passable (average 77), I had to recently go through the trauma of withdrawing from a research based subject too late in the game because my supervisor didn't do his job and I was chasing red herrings for 9 months (the subject was only meant to be 13 weeks).

I was going to be hired by a government department on completion of the BEng, but said department is being privatised (unbeknownst to most people in the state) and I have buckleys of working there. Besides, I wouldn't move to a rural area to work for the bastards who buy it.

Thankfully, I have been able to enrol in some comp sci subjects, in which I am doing reasonably well, and I'm really enjoying getting the brain gears turning. I want to continue on this career path, but in order to keep my scholarship I need to do surveying subjects which are awful. I am thinking of just not enrolling in them and doing a full comp sci load, then going for either an internship or further study in AI.

**Problem 2:** I have a particular dickhead friend who likes to emphasise the problems with my situation, and this person is difficult to remove. He has no respect for me and he's also quite scary- he's happily regaled me with stories of his violent past. In fact, I'm going on a holiday with him and his wife soon because he bullied me into letting him come along. We actually had a period where we didn't talk because I told him he was talking shit and he couldn't hack the criticism. My only issue now is he's going to fuck up my holiday - the one thing keeping me going.

**Problem 3** I'm the kind of person who would require having a reasonable job away from the rabble of the clawing masses whilst earning enough cash to compensate for my rather commonplace physical insufficiencies and mild self-diagnosed Asperger's. Make your own judgement if you will.

TL;DR Lame weakling with patchy academic qualifications can't get a good job. First world problems.

EDIT: Grammar."

When I think of myself when I'm 30-40 I want to be an architect.  I've read and heard enough about how the job actually looks like  (meeting clients, endless revisions, tight deadlines etc.) I definitely want to do it.

I guess for 3 years I was a stereotypical lazy student playing video games all day. But I changed my life this year, I went on a diet started exercizing, made a schedule to my day, picked up old hobbies. I feel like this is permament.

And all would be great except: I can't focus on school I don't even like it and architecture is far from 'being my life'. I have friends who work their asses off on projects and in their free time they read architecture articles, learn new stuff on their own etc. They are miles ahead of me at that point. Of course that takes its toll and they have no interests besides that.

I want to take a couple years off - make a portfolio, apply for an internship for some architecture firm, maybe then travel somewhere (which I really want). If I stay in school I know I will half-ass and don't enjoy it. I guess while I am writing this I figured I made my decision.

My primary concern is that when I finish school my friends will be full time architects. If I were to do it I would be the only one on my year to do so.

You think I don't notice that the only times you talk to me is when you're bored? The only reason why I respond to you and try to be civil on Facebook is because you have cancer. You don't even recognize how rude you are because your ego is inflated too large. Nobody ever tells you that you might be a shitty person. You are not even humbled by your cancer. All you complained about during chemo is how bored you were because you couldn't drink or party. You complain about how bored and sick of your family you are, while you are lucky to come from a wealthy family where they can afford to fly you to the best specialists, no matter where they are located, while also fully supporting and loving you. This is a grudge that's been held almost 10 years. We are cousins, but we used to be best friends. You dropped me because I wasn't cool enough to be your friend. We are probably more similar now than we were when we were friends, but you don't care to try to learn that about us anymore. It's fine that we aren't friends, but to have the audacity to ask me to edit your internship application after we have only spoken once in just the last year is insane.
Everybody says that I am just being bitter about our loss of friendship, and how because you are family, I should still care, but I don't. You are worse than a stranger to me, you are a person who thinks you can use me whenever you want."

I told myself I wouldn't freak out too much, but after doing some research I could really use some affirmation about my drug test. I recently got a really good internship I really wanted, yada yada yada. But my last hurdle to being good to go (I start on monday) was the drug test. I'm a pretty skinny guy, about 6'1"" 145 lbs with a pretty good metabolism, and I knew about the test in advance so I was able to lay off for a while. I took a break of 37 days since I smoked before the test and the last time I smoked was a grav I took following about a week break (I had been weaning myself off to ease the transition). The company uses labcorp for their tests and stated a 15 ng/mL cutoff. Any who, the day of the test I chugged two bottles of water, and forced myself to pee twice before I got there, but I had to sit for a while so while I sat the water 'registered' with my body and by the time I took it I really had to piss. I used midstream pee and talked to the lady about how much water I drank to see if she would say anything about dilution but she didn't. That was Monday. I really wanted to wait for the results to smoke again, but I gave in and had a small hit after the test. Do you think there's a chance I'll fail or be called back in for dilution? I've stopped smoking until I get word. I also emailed my manager about my start time and she didn't mention anything. Am I in the clear yet?

So I've always had a problem with the things that come out of my mouth. I tend to offend people without meaning to, and I generally come off as a mean, unfriendly bitch (with a lot of unnecessary flamboyance and drama). If you can, imagine that one person who's always loud, mean and generally obnoxious. Somehow I still have friends, but I feel they tolerate me more than truly enjoy spending time with me. 

It's also starting to affect my work. For example today, I made a remark that I feel may have offended someone and given them a bad impression of my work ethic as an intern (I was being berated for having appointments overlap by 10 minutes, to which I replied that I had to wait for X, a senior staff, to pass me his work before I could do mine). I meant to, and hopefully did, say it in a joking manner but I suppose it might have been construed as me pushing the blame on someone else, since my default facial expression is 'grumpy and always-looking-for-a-fight'.

I realise I shouldn't have made that remark in the first place, but upon further reflection, I probably do this more often than I realise. I find it difficult to recognise where the joking boundaries are, which is doubly hard for me since my jokes probably don't come across as such (ah, the pitfalls of sarcasm). 

My question: What sort of person do people like to work/hang out with and how can I become that person? Any tips for me to give people a good impression? I also want to make this change last long term, so any advice is welcome! Please, if I'm unclear in my post, ask me to clarify! "
1edtkd,6,2013-05-15,Target Date Break Even ROI for Graduate Degree,loopy212,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1edtkd/target_date_break_even_roi_for_graduate_degree/,"I've been thinking about pursuing a graduate degree and am trying to evaluate the effect of such on my personal financial situation.  Please note that the following is gross of tax.

My current income is $80k base with a variable bonus component.  For the sake of the analysis, I've estimated the bonus at $5k, which is somewhat low (received a $15k bonus last year), but I'd expect to receive at least that each year.  My career is in a bit of a weird place, so I've modeled salary growth a few different ways.  I've shown flat 2% growth indefinitely (that's probably low in the short term and high in the long term) and two stage growth with 5% growth in the short term tapering off to 2% growth long term (current career has a salary ceiling).  It's highly likely that I will switch out of my current area in the next 1-2 years taking a potential pay cut (MBA notwithstanding), which I haven't modeled.

The program I am looking into is a two year, full time program with a paid internship over the summer bridging the two years; standard full-time MBA program.  I've estimated the all-in costs to be $75k per year.  Tuition runs between $55k and $65k with housing and living expenses being a variable; I came up with $75k as a somewhat conservative estimate; every school I am looking at except Boston schools will probably be below this.

Internship expected salary is $15k.  Post-graduation, the median salary of the weakest school I am applying to is ~$115k with a median $20k signing bonus; this is the baseline for all my salary projections, but there is a big upside, if I get into H/S/W it would be more like $160k base + $30k bonus.  I'm assuming no other bonuses in the out years, but post-MBA the bonus potential is much higher than my current career.  Also looked at two different scenarios, a 5% flat post-MBA salary growth and a 5% growth for 5 years declining to 2.5% after that.

For discount rate, I'm assuming 4% (7% interest rate for student loans less 3% inflation).

Based on the above outlined terms, I am looking at between 8 and 9 years to achieve break-even ROI between getting an MBA and staying in my current career.  To me, that seems like a long time to get to break even, but I'm not sure what a ""normal"" break even period is for graduate degrees.  

I feel like there is something I am missing here because basically it doesn't seem to make much sense to get my MBA from a financial perspective.  I'm hopeful there is just something I am missing here.

TL;DR What is an acceptable break even time for professional graduate degrees?"

They told me they’d be in contact soon about how we go from here.

I haven’t heard back, although it has only been three full business days. I understand that they are extremely busy and that the size of this organization likely makes it so they have multiple levels to go through to make an offer.

Now I received another call saying that they do want to interview me meaning that if i get the job i would have to take a drug test in the beginning of June before I start.

 I'm a 5'10"" male, around 120 pounds and a fast metabolism. Before the original break I smoked daily but approaching 4/20 smoked more than usual. I stopped until last weekend and vaped maybe a gram and a half. Now I'm drinking bottles of water a day, I picked up a green tea metabolism supplement and I'm thinking of picking up Niacin pills. I plan on constantly drinking water until I have to take this test (praying I can get it pushed to Mid-June) and planning on running daily.

I just finished my first year at a large community college. After next year I'll be transferring to a local 4 year school which, while unranked in CS, does have some top accounting and finance employers represented at its job fairs. So while I'd love to end up at a school with more interest from employers, I am ultimately not too concerned about getting an internship as a rising senior in a couple years.

However, I'm not sure what options are open to me if any in terms of an internship during my second summer. I know many students just pursue just one internship. But from what I understand, second summer internships aren't completely rare, and if possible I'd like to work during that period (to make the money, to learn, and to be more attractive to employers upon graduation). My community college doesn't really have any career resources to speak of in this field.

My first thought is to try and interface with the school I'll be transferring to (I've already signed a dual admissions plan with them). If that doesn't work, though, is there an independent route for this? Would I just seek out companies and apply independently? I don't know if that's even a thing that's 'done' for internships. "

Yesterday afternoon I made plans with my girlfriend of 6 months to go see a pre-screening of the internship after I finished work. 

When we talked, I informed her that the screeners of the movie always overbook the tickets so it's always full and because of this we needed to get there early, so we agreed that she'd pick me up directly from the train and we'd go over. 

So, she picks me up and we head over. On the way she informs me that she is starving and hasn't eaten all day long and wants to stop before at the whole foods. I tell her that if we don't go straight there we won't get seats, but if we go get our seats first, she could leave and run over because we'd have time to spare. 

She refuses to park first and just drops me off out front. I go in where there's already a line, you have to check your phone (anti-piracy), and long story short it sells out before she gets back just like I knew it would. For the record, you can't save seats because they fill every seat. 

Here's the thing, I really wanted to see this movie and she isn't that big into going to the movies. I just started working downtown 9 hours a day + commute and she's just moved home from college. I repeatedly told her to grab a snack before hand because if we didn't go straight there we'd miss it. 

It's just frustrating because it seems like she willfully and selfishly put her needs in front of mine. 

I won't try to parallel my behavior with hers for the sake of objectivism, but I know for a fact that I have in the past given her my full consideration for things she's wanted to do, even if I didn't really want to go. 

Reddit am I wrong for seeing this as selfish at most and thoughtless at best? 

Tl:Dr - I missed a pre-screening of a movie because my gf decided to go to the grocery store right before against my firm advisement."

I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I'm in a really bad place and I need to vent. If this post doesn't belong here then downvote or please let me know where I can ask instead.

I've known this girl for 8 years now. About a year before graduating from school and going to University we started going out, having been best friends before that. I had the best 3 and a half years of my life until she broke up with me a couple of days ago. Now I'm feeling a bit scared for the future, since she was the only person I could ever talk to.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been very closed emotionally and have never opened up to anyone. When my gf first broke up with me I felt very lost and afraid, because I needed to talk to someone about this but she was the only person I had. I've never been that close to my parents, and with my close friends I just talk about stuff that interests us. She was the first one I could actually open up to and not feel afraid or embarassed; she would offer good advice and help.

The thing is I caved in and called her afterwards and she was very eager to help me get through this, and be there for me. That is a great thing about her. The problem though is she lives in a different city, and I am currently stuck living with my mum and sister doing an internship I hate, when all of my friends are at university.

I also feel I need to get some distance from her to be able to get over this healthily. I don't want to depend on her anymore, yet I have no-one I can really turn to in this moment. I'm very depressed and I'm trying very hard to be strong and look positively to the future but I keep thinking about how much has been thrown away with this relationship and it is haunting me. All of my clothes, posters in my room, belongings are either from her or in some way relate to her. There are too many memories that I can't stop clinging on to.

The breakup was very sudden and I didn't really see it coming. Can someone offer some advice or share a similar experince? It would help me immensely.


**EDIT:** Thank you all so much for your responses, I actually feel much better and more positive in my mind! I'm gonna try and minimise contact with her for a while, and go out and be pro-active!"

a. A 'Work permit' which allows me to legally work in Canada. 

b. I should have been a resident in the same province that the company is in so that the latter is eligible for tax returns.



About point 'a' I am planning to take a french language course that apparently comes with a 'work permit' which can be used to get internships or find jobs. 

Now about point 'b' , I heard from an employer that I should have paid taxes the previous year in order to qualify and should have stayed for at least six months. So its better to arrive before 'tax time' than after it. Could anyone please share more information about this ?

Instead they offered 25/hour WITH a signing bonus for 3000. I've heard of this for full time employees, but is it normal to have this offer as in intern?

UPDATE: Thank you for the responses. I guess I could have explained what area I was in. I'm in Houston at not Big 4, but whatever is right underneath that. 

Also I've decided to take the offer because of the incredible compensation and because I've fallen in love with the office and the people I've met. Now I gotta put my big boy pants on instead of redditing/LoL/Trees."

Currently I'm dating this guy who is quite an academic achiever. We got along well but I constantly felt self-conscious because my grades and achievements are less than his.

1ed4rk,1,2013-05-15,I'm a humanities major and am doing OK. Advice below.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ed4rk/im_a_humanities_major_and_am_doing_ok_advice_below/,"I studied philosophy and film studies because I loved the material. I understood that a BA degree in itself isn't a golden ticket to a job. I'm going into a secondary degree in a competative program for PR/Advertising. 

I also was hired yesterday to do tech support at an ISP company. I'll be getting ~40K a year (dependent on bonuses). In addition to this, I've been contracted as a freelance copy writer for $50 an hour. This sounds great, but remember I won't be working 40hr weeks and will have to pay for my own costs out of this. 

I'm in the position I am now due to networking, using staffing agencies and busting my ass during uni. I managed to get a paid position at my student paper. I didn't like the material I was supposed to cover, but I applied myself and did very well. That summer I got a great internship at a niche mag and used the opportunity to build my resume. 

Then I heard about this competitive PR/Ad program and joined my local PR society to network. The women who vetted me in was a graduate from the program and only said nice things about it. 

There is a reason I'm in an OK position today. I'm not doing the best out of everyone, but I have employment and plans for the future. 

Understand that your degree isn't a terminal or professional one. It's there to give you skills that you can apply to other careers. It's up to you to figure out what you want to do next. 

Finally, make sure you have great interview skills. I've been hired for jobs (newspaper/ISP) because I can interview well. It actually isn't that difficult. Be relaxed, answer the questions sufficiently, smile at the interviewers and look everyone in the eye. Basically, be normal. 

That's all folks, hope my advice will help some of you."

This is now the third summer we've been working together. We were pretty flirty the first time around when we first met, but I was committed to another girl. You didn't know it, but she broke my heart in the fall and ran off with who I thought was my best friend. I took it pretty hard and started eating the pain. It was only a few pounds at first, but it didn't get better. 

It got worse.

What was just 10 pounds became 20. Which became 30. Which is now 40 pounds heavier. It may not seem like a lot to some, but I have a small frame with nowhere for the fat to spread out.  A healthy varsity soccer player now can no longer even play a full intramural game because of the exhaustion. 

Grades slipped along with confidence in myself and my abilities. The second summer came around and there we were again. Except this time, I didn't even have the courage to look you in the eyes or even talk to you. Ashamed at what has become of me. 

I had a losing mentality. Illness plagued me. Body became weak. Along with a troubled household, the only thing that gave me comfort was food. Always there in the fridge. Mountain Dew became my best friend and helped me ignore the piling homework and the fighting.

And here is the third summer. Came by in a heartbeat. And here you are again, gorgeous as always. Unchanging. Just like me. 

But I did change. 

I wasn't always like this. And so I started insanity. I'm on my third week. I don't exactly see results, but I feel it. I feel like I'm working towards something again. Like I'm fighting back. Like the Boston Bruins, I'm coming back. 

So to the girl at my internship. Thank you. I'm not doing this for you. Or for that matter, any girls like you. I'm doing this for me. To get back what I have lost. To get back into the confident, aspiring, happy person I used to be. I will dig deeper. I will prevail. 

And you can too. 

If you are reading my story, thank you. If you are in the same situation as me, just know you aren't alone. Keep at it. I will if you will. 

To the girl at my internship, I'm going to talk to you again."

1ed0gk,21,2013-05-14,My question for Justin to ask...[sorta not meta],medym,metacanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/metacanada/comments/1ed0gk/my_question_for_justin_to_asksorta_not_meta/,"So Trudeau has asked for Canadians to come together and help do his job for him by drafting questions for the Liberals to ask during Question Period. 

I for one have grown tired of Members of Parliament who collect over $150,000/year salary, benefits, and one of the best pensions in Canada and yet fail to show up to work.  I have written to my Member of Parliament on this very issue, because fuck, if we are going to get First Nations, Unions and all those groups to have greater disclosure, why not shed light on Parliamentary attendance?

So here was my glorious question for him to ask... of himself.

&gt;Mr Speaker, middle class Canadians are facing continual hardship during these tough economic times.  Despite this, our government continues to waste millions of these hard working Canadian's money.  The average Member of Parliament makes well over $150,000 annually, plus benefits, putting all MPs within ""the 1%.""  This cost is carried heaviest by middle class Canadians who contribute through their tax dollars. Within the House of Commons (hopefully) are MPs who have missed over 200 votes since 2011.  Despite this, they still received healthy pay cheques at the expense of the taxpayers.

&gt;The Hon Jack Layton once proudly stated, ""You know, most Canadians, if they don’t show up for work, they don’t get a promotion!"" These strong words are as relevant now as they were in 2011. 

&gt;With these words in mind, what will the Conservative Government do to ensure Members of Parliament execute the trust of their constituents properly and that Canadians tax dollars are not gone to waste on absence

I cringed at the 1000 word cut off.  But I guess interns only have so much time in their day.

Attendance of MPs in the House of Commons is not published, so knowing how often our MPs are present is hard to determine.   This article laid it out pretty good:

http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2013/02/18/mp-voting-records-the-best-and-the-not-so-best/

Of the ten worst MPs in attendance are broken down by party lines nicely;

* 5 Liberals
* 2 Conservatives (but one is Harper, so I really am not worried there)
* 1 Bloc
* 1 NDP
* 1 Independent

When Michael Ignatieff was called out by Layton on his attendance had [missed 115 votes between 2009 and 2011](http://www.canada.com/news/Ignatieff+excuse+missing+votes+Commons+does+hold/4628958/story.html).  Mr Trudeau has missed 221.


I encourage you all to take the time to contribute to this glorious democratic endeavor and give Justin your questions.  Remember: ties are optional.

tl:dr fuck you, I spent long enough to type this I am not typing a tldr for you.

I'm 23 years old, 1 year out of college. 

I've not gotten along with my mother because she didn't raise me from when I was 5-10 and is not the most verbally affectionate person, but now I realize how much she cares for me. My single mom's paid for half of my educational costs despite her hating her job.

And fast forward to me, who has been mooching off of her-- I've been fired from 1 job after 5 months, quit an internship 2 weeks in without notice after realizing I am not fitting in, and taking on a minimum wage customer service job to be a better people person. I am struggling financially.

I feel very guilty for not landing a good job after college. My mom's been taking care of my grandmother who is severely depressed (she came to the US to raise me). My Dad's not in the picture because he and decided to live with his mom to evade debt in the US when I was 12.

I'm scared that I'm turning out like my dad. Leaving commitments and I only have a few friends at a time in my life. 

I've stayed at my college town for 5 years. The school is definitely a reach school and I would not have gotten there without my Mom pushing me. 5 years of studying and almost dropping out, came out with a degree I don't care much about with a 2.9 GPA. 

No big network of friends and I think I'm pissing away my youth at my Mom's expense. I'm thinking of working at the oil fields in middle America to pay my educational debts or maybe moving back home to help my grandmother. 

TLDR; led sheltered life, can't hold down a job, burn bridges, have few friends, don't want to end up like my dad and grandma who don't have a support network. I feel like a robot that doesn't see the consequences of what I do to other people. How can I change?"

Lost:
1)Can't even write anything concrete. I was gonna say ""that feeling of amazement when looking at or thinking about something new/in a new light"" etc. but I honestly haven't had that experience since I started. It got to the stage where I was mindlessly gorging on doritos staring at the TV having trouble formulating a sentence , barely aware of what I was doing.

Gained:
1)Memory.
2)Diet improved. (less munch)
3)Get out of bed more easily in the mornings.
4)Not worried about getting caught.
5)Not dealing with unwashed, zoned out dealers and their terrible time keeping.
6)Energy.
7)Have improved myself in numerous ways, now spend many evenings teaching myself to cook. This is a skill that I enjoy, benefits my wallet and waist and I can share with others. Weed only filled one of these categories (and only just about).



*****8)SHEDS of MONEY!I calculated that I used to spend about 6,500 a year on weed.I had to go buy bonds the other day because my savings account offered too low of an interest rate. I now actually have a problem of having too much money as opposed to not enough. My girlfriend asked if we could go on holiday by ourselves for a week or two this summer. I dont have to think about it.
9)Respect of my aunts and uncles. They knew I smoked, I didn't lie about it. They didn't mind too much but they thought it was a bit juvenile, cliched and a waste of time and money.
10)More comfortable in social situations.
11)Grades have gone up.
12)Don't have to worry about drug tests for internships this summer.
13)Don't have to socialize between the hours of 11-4 to smoke when peoples parents are out or asleep.
14)Dont have a cough (I smoked weed mixed with tobacco, the norm where I'm form).
15)I'm focusing way more on the long term, what I'm gonna do when I'm out of college etc.

I strongly urge all of you other leaves to make out a PRO/CON list on your phone and look at it when you get cravings or excuse yourself to the bathroom and read it if offered in person. I say no without a sense of accomplishment or self regulation, it doesn't even register. It's basically an automatic reflex at this point!

Long Story Short:(...I'm new to reddit!)
Since I look at what I've gained vs. what I've lost I no longer think about it as ""giving something up"" but ""stopping"" because I've gained way more than I've given up. This simple mindset makes all the difference. 

Thanks to everyone on leaves for opening my eyes and removing the ambiguity I felt about stopping.

I needed to get back to myself, and I didn't know how to do that while continuing to be with you. I'm sorry that I can't get myself back to an emotionally-stable place.


I still dream about you, and I cry when I think of you looking at another girl the way you looked at me, but I have to let you move on. I have to deal with the consequences of my actions. You took me back once before after I thought I needed a break, and I'm not expecting it a second time. I tell myself I'm happy as long as you're happy, but that's a lie. I'm only happy if you're happy with me. I have to stop inserting myself into your life as soon as you move on though.   


You once told me ""I finally found you in my dreams"". Well, I can't get you out of mine now. "

1ehge5,29,2013-05-16,I am not looking forward to the lonliness of summer vacation.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ehge5/i_am_not_looking_forward_to_the_lonliness_of/,"probably no one will read this but whatever

I am not looking forward to summer. At all. In fact, I'm dreading it. I mean, I'm looking forward to not having to deal with the stress of school. But I'm afraid that I'm going to go crazy from lonliness. No one does anything with me anymore. Not even my friends who used to always do things with me. They have better people to hang out with. The one person who would always hang out with me if he wasn't at college or busy with school stuff (which wasn't often) was my brother, and now he's moving away for the summer to intern at a physics lab (which is awesome for him, and I'm glad for him). so im going to be all alone. all fucking summer. It will be like my daily after school routine of get home, cry, watch netflix/play video games for a few hours, go lay in bed, and go to sleep. Only instead of being just a small portion of the day, it will be the entire fucking day. For three months. All alone. With no one to talk to. During the school year, at least I can pretend to be happy for seven hours and talk to people who at least act like they like me, but during the summer I will be all alone. so fucking alone.

The only person I can talk to about this or any of my other issues is my therapist, but I can only talk to her for one hour every two weeks, and I don't even tell her everything because I'm a fucking pussy (in fact, what I've told her is just the tip of the ice berg. She probably thinks i'm just wasting her time). I can't talk to anyone else I know because whenever someone gives me any sort of attention in that area, and allows me to talk to them about my issues, I bother them to the point that they hate me and no longer care and just want me to leave them alone. and sometimes i desperately try to make them forgive me because i'm scared of being lonely and i dont want to keep everything bottled up inside of me, but I always fail. always. So I go on being lonely. i guess I'm kinda getting used to it, but that doesn't mean it feels ok.

oh well. here's to everyone else having a good summer vacation"

I am almost 22 year old, male, I've been in relationships before and had some flings with different girls over the years, but never felt complete. I could never find what I was looking for, and things never worked. When I went to college, it was in a terrible city and I hated everything about it. My 3rd year in, I hit a low point of partying, and mild depression. I met a girl at work, 21, and we quickly hit it off. Things literally took off. We both said to take things slow, and we did, but at the same time everything just went so fast.

We didn't have sex until about 2 months into being exclusive, despite spending almost every night together. We grew closer and closer together, and we have undoubtedly fell in love. **We've only been together for 3 months now.** In retrospect, that isn't much time at all. We've talked about it, and we both agree **it has felt like 10 months** or so. We've talked about marriage, our future together, engagement, budgeting, everything of that nature. It seems fast, logically, but it doesn't feel fast.** I love her, she loves me**, and I've never been happier. 

**I've found the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.** I'm the kind of guy to think long and hard about things. I hate commitment, and I hate the idea of being locked into something. But without a doubt, I want to marry her. She said if I proposed, she'd definitely say yes. Though she wants us to wait at least a year so her family would be more accepting to the idea.

**We spend every night together.** With an occasional 1 night apart due to exams or something. I've met her immediate family, and they all like me. I've met her cousins, whom she is close to. They like me. She's met my immediate family, same situation.


**What is the problem?**

**1.** We have events within the near future that will cause long separations. The closest one being a summer internship. I'll be moving 5 hours away, renting a room from one of her cousins in the city. **I won't get to see her all summer.** It is going to be painful physically and emotionally for both of us. She is seemingly confident of the situation, absolutely sure we'll power through it together. I've seen long distance relationships first hand, and I'm afraid she isn't fully aware of the situation and she will slip away from me. **I've talked to her directly about it, but she gets upset, she says ""I don't like that you don't have confidence in us."". I know we'll make it through the time, but I'm afraid it will damage the structure.** 

With that, there is a foreseeable problem in about a year where I'll graduate but she'll have another year, along with specialization schooling. It could cause another 1-4 years of separation depending on the circumstances. Due to the time between then, I'm mainly looking for advice in regards of the current summer separation.

**2.**
We are completely comfortable together now. The things we aren't fully comfortable with, we are slowly working on. I can notice us both getting more relaxed with things. However, **I still feel like it is the first date every time I see her.** I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing. But basically, **I have that constant feeling of pressure that I need to always impress her**. As if I am still trying to win her over. I don't know why, but it is always there. **It is stressful.** Any ideas on why that is, what it is, how I can fix that, etc?



**TL;DR is in bold.**
**If there are any questions, please ask.** "

It's a really unique and amazing program I was accepted into freshman year. Mr.Erickson, the man you will see in the pictures here, teaches a majority of the kids. I was lucky enough to have him last year and this year, I'm seriously praying I get him next year as well. Erickson stays after school to help shoot video for events around the school WITHOUT PAY FOR OVERTIME. Seriously it's not unusual for him to be at school for about 12 hours until he goes home. On top of that, he's an incredible teacher and encourages us to follow our dreams and he helps all of us with unrelenting patience. His son Matthew (the baby in the pictures) was born with a brain tumor a little over a year ago. He's doing very well today, but it's been a really big struggle for the last year and I wanted to give him a cool present, especially considering this year he's been trying to get me an internship and I've become a lot more aware of how awesome he is. In our classroom, we have movie posters hanging everywhere (film is also part of our broadcasting curriculum). I wanted to make a fake movie poster with Erickson on it. All I need is the picture to get printed out as a poster, and that's where I need your help, redditors. I've included an album of Erickson and his wife and kids (sorry it's separate pictures, I couldn't find one of them all together). I actually can't decide if it'd be better to just have him on the poster or his whole family, but whatever you think would look better or would be easier. And if you know how to make it look like a movie poster, please format as such. If not I'm sure I could just take the cutout and figure out how to make it look like a movie poster. But I want the movie to be called ""Erickson: King of Beacon"", directed by George Lucas (he's a huge Star Wars fan), and if at all possible please make him shoot lasers at Billy Mitchell (we just finished watching King of Kong in class and it's kinda a joke). I know it's a lot of work but you have no idea how much I would appreciate whatever you have time to offer me.

1eh7dz,1,2013-05-16,She (F23) changed her mind about moving to Utah with me (M25). What should I do?!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1eh7dz/she_f23_changed_her_mind_about_moving_to_utah/,"Her and I have been dating for one year.  (M25 and F23)  It has been the best relationship I've ever been in and I'm ready to tie the knot!  The only problem is I'm also wanting to move out West for graduate school (moving from TN to UT).  I've gotten all of my ducks in a row - been accepted, financial aid accrued, now all I have to do is finish out my job and save money.  She's always been on board with Utah *AT SOME POINT* and up until yesterday she was down to move after her last summer classes.  

Unfortunately, she's decided that she's too unsure about her career to move.  She hasn't had any internships and as of now has around 10 different directions to go with her degree and can't figure out which to take.  In addition, she has hardily any money; I'm happy to help fund her until she would find a job in Utah but she doesn't want help.  

Now, she does not want to break up- she claims she feels the same for me and would be fine with long distance for any length of time.  My predictions would be that she would find a job in TN and be too tied down with the job to move to be with me in UT.  *Best case scenario would be her getting an internship for 6 months followed by moving to Utah for a full time job.*  I'm afraid if we do long distance longer than 6 months, our relationship will cease to be relevant.  In this case, I would be forced to date around in Utah, which is not a good plan considering I'm non-religious and half the population of SLC is Mormon.    

What's more, I have no way to tell if she's serious about staying with me- *she's against getting engaged and can't think of any way to prove to me that she'll move to UT with me before too long.*  In fact, I've invested more into this relationship, but that's to be expected when I make more money and am more open to commitment than her.  We're together every day and we love each other-is this enough to prove she's in this for the long haul?

So at this point I don't know what to do. My options are:

1)  Don't do graduate school, stay with her in TN and find a different job, thus throwing away my dreams of living out west.

2)  Go to Utah, relationship becomes long distance with an undefinable resolution.  

So, should I go to Utah or stay with her?  I'm already leaning towards Utah, but how could I better ensure she'll actually end up out there with me before our relationship stagnates?

**TL;DR - I want to move to Utah, but girlfriend's confusion in life will likely lead us into a long distance relationship.  How can I make sure the long distance doesn't last too long?**"

1eh4pu,6,2013-05-16,I am new to saving/investing and just landed my first well-paying full time job: please critique my plan,pf_help,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1eh4pu/i_am_new_to_savinginvesting_and_just_landed_my/,"Hello PF!  

I just completed my PhD and am about to start working.  Up until now my income has been nearly equivalent to my spending (with the exception of a brief stint with a very well-paying internship), and thus I have little experience with saving money.  I am **27 years old** and have $0 in retirement savings, an **emergency fund (checking account) of $12,000**, and (thankfully) **no debt**.

I am hoping you can lend some insight and critique my savings plan based upon the goals I have outlined below.  I sincerely appreciate your input, pf.

---Long Term Goal---

My goal (which is admittedly a moving target) is to be **semi-retired by 55**.  If I am lucky, I think I would like to switch to a light teaching schedule at a local college when I reach 55 in order to provide steady income and keep my mind active.  Until then, I expect to work in industry.

---Near-Term Goal---

I would like to get married within a couple years, and **buy a house within 3-5 years**.  I have done some initial research and think I can find a home around $150,000-$200,000 for starting a family which I will be very happy with.  I will assume for the sake of planning that we will be starting a family in 5-6 years. 

---Relevant Info---

My **base salary is $99,000** with annual bonuses that **add another 8%-12%**.  Since I have no retirement savings right now, I want to be somewhat aggressive in saving for retirement.  My plan is to contribute **6% to traditional 401k*** (company matches full up to 3%) and **use the yearly bonus to max out an IRA**.

Regarding an IRA, I apologize for my ignorance on the subject, but my knowledge of investments and retirement plans are fairly lacking (I have begun reading the investment books recommended in the FAQ, though!).  I am **not sure if the 28% tax bracket is so high that I should avoid a Roth IRA**, or if I can safely assume taxes will be higher in the future.  I also know there is a ""phase-out"" range for IRA contributions when AGI&gt;$112,000.  Since my base+bonus could fall near that range, is this something I need to account for (and if so, how?)?

---Allocation of post-tax savings---

My initial thought for **IRA allocation is 80/20 stock/bond index through Vanguard, allocating 10% to an international stock index**.

I am planning to fill out the W-4 withholding 0 allowances this year.  I know I have seen here and in investment books that this isn't so smart an idea, since I am giving an interest free loan to the government, but I would much rather Uncle Sam owe me than me owe him (at least for this first year).

That said, I am **estimating my monthly take home** (before accounting for medical insurance) **to be $5,000**.  I know I can **save at least $1,850 per month**, and balance the other 63% of take home pay between Needs and Wants.  I suspect I am overestimating my needs and wants, but since I am moving to a new state (with slightly higher cost of living) and have new expenses to worry about, I am taking a conservative approach for now.

I would like to **bolster my emergency fund up to ~$18,000**.  Right now I think savings accounts' apy are too low to warrant a transfer of my emergency fund from checking, but I will revisit this plan if savings accounts improve.

After the emergency fund, I think my focus should be on saving for a house.  If my timeline is no earlier than 3 years, I think a **money market (VMMXX) with low risk** is my best bet.  After accounting for the allocation of my bonus to max my IRA, the remainder of the annual bonus plus monthly savings should allow me to **save $24,000 per year** (to be more precise: $18,000 for this first year after accounting for the emergency fund bump, and then $24,000 annually in the future).

I should therefore be able to afford a 20% down payment on a $150,000 house plus 40% for closing costs and whatnot in two years.  I am assuming closer to 3 years before buying a house since I want to have the ability to look at homes up to $200,000 while staying within my budget.

---Closing Comments---

Okay, pf, I know I just essentially tried to outline my whole life here, but for anyone that actually read through my wall of text, I sincerely appreciate your time and any criticisms or recommendations regarding my plan.  I am new to planning for my future and want to be responsible about it.

Also, please let me know what books or resources you may recommend I focus on to enhance my financial knowledge.  So far, thanks to the FAQ sidebar, I read Suze Orman's Young, Fabulous and Broke.  I am also halfway done with the Boglehead's Guide to Investing.

[xpost from /r/insanityworkout],[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1eh3la/to_the_girl_at_my_internship_xpost_from/,"To the girl at my internship. This is now the third summer we've been working together. We were pretty flirty the first time around when we first met, but I was committed to another girl. You didn't know it, but she broke my heart in the fall and ran off with who I thought was my best friend. I took it pretty hard and started eating the pain. It was only a few pounds at first, but it didn't get better.
It got worse.
What was just 10 pounds became 20. Which became 30. Which is now 40 pounds heavier. It may not seem like a lot to some, but I have a small frame with nowhere for the fat to spread out. A healthy varsity soccer player now can no longer even play a full intramural game because of the exhaustion.
Grades slipped along with confidence in myself and my abilities. The second summer came around and there we were again. Except this time, I didn't even have the courage to look you in the eyes or even talk to you. Ashamed at what has become of me.
I had a losing mentality. Illness plagued me. Body became weak. Along with a troubled household, the only thing that gave me comfort was food. Always there in the fridge. Mountain Dew became my best friend and helped me ignore the piling homework and the fighting.
And here is the third summer. Came by in a heartbeat. And here you are again, gorgeous as always. Unchanging. Just like me.
But I did change.
I wasn't always like this. And so I started insanity. I'm on my third week. I don't exactly see results, but I feel it. I feel like I'm working towards something again. Like I'm fighting back. Like the Boston Bruins, I'm coming back.
So to the girl at my internship. Thank you. I'm not doing this for you. Or for that matter, any girls like you. I'm doing this for me. To get back what I have lost. To get back into the confident, aspiring, happy person I used to be. I will dig deeper. I will prevail.
And you can too.
If you are reading my story, thank you. If you are in the same situation as me, just know you aren't alone. Keep at it. I will if you will.
To the girl at my internship, I'm going to talk to you again."

I was just informed that I have to get an implant and have quite a few questions and concerns.

In about 2000 I busted out my 4 front teeth, resulting after years of surgeries[root canals] to 2 veneers and 2 crowns(two front teeth) well my gums around one of my crowns started receding about a year a half ago. I went to the dentist today and they did an x-ray of the tooth and saw that I have a large cavity in that tooth. He told me that inside of if is basically turning ""soft"" because the cavity eats away at the tooth. He said I don't feel it because I received a root canal. So there's my background story.

My questions are:

My dentist had said there was nothing much i could do to prevent this cavity because it was inside so who's fault was this? Should I just maybe use more mouth wash because that's the only thing that would clean maybe inside of it?

How much will this single implant cost? They were talking about fixing my other crown as well since they came out a little shorter than preferred.

I am going to a consultation with my dentist. I have read a little but about complications with surgeries and I want the best person to do it so I don't come across problems. So is a dentist out of the question? He seems very genuine and intelligent but would a oral surgeon or something else be a better idea?

What's the chances that this doesn't work in some way? I just worry because i have perfect teeth now and I don't want to be imperfect for the rest of my life.

How long do I have to wear the fake tooth? I saw you have to wear a retainer with a fake tooth on it and I am just about to graduate college and have an internship this summer where I really need to look good and I'm scared missing this tooth and my tooth possibly popping out will just kill my confidence. So how legit do the retainer teeth look, will anyone notice?

How often will I need to get new crowns?

All in all how long until i look normal again? And will I look normal?!

Thanks in advance r/Dentistry!"

**She** - insecure, daddy issues, prone to negativity and stress

**Me** - Jealous, insecure (I think?), evaluating my ability to listen and treat others well

**The reason for the breakup** - she believed I did not show her enough affection. I believed I was showing affection through support and positivity (helped her with homework, essays, internships, resumes, ambition). This led to an imbalance where we were asking for/giving different things.

After the breakup, I tried desperately to tell her that I was willing to work on everything. I tried to tell her that I was willing to get better and change because I love her. We had several serious discussions where I laid out everything I knew I did wrong, how I wanted to fix each one, and I put away all of what I believed she could do to improve the relationships, giving away my self-value and worth. Each time I was met with responses like ""I don't want you to change to love me, I just want to be loved"" and ""we're not meant to be"".

After three weeks, in the middle of my recovery from a break up, she contacts me, asking me how I am and telling me that she cried the first day she got to Egypt (internship that I helped her get) due to loneliness. I feel like I'm being strung along... getting friend zoned by an ex. I can't provide that kind of support and not be in the relationship - it's not fair to me and I need to move on. I make a mental note that the next time she seeks support from me, I would tell her that I still want to be with her, to give her support. If not, then we have to be in No Contact. 

A few days later, she reaches out again, and I tell her that. And here's where it gets really messed up for me. I find out she got really close to a friend she met while we were dating after we broke up. They saw each other 10 times in the immediate 2 weeks. I don't know how much more ""leapfrogging"" that can get. She slept with him within two weeks and Skypes with him in Egypt. I have issues with jealousy in the past. I am not a nervous, uptight, or high-strung guy, but the jealousy that came from this was absolutely *debilitating*. I couldn't breathe and couldn't think straight for three days. It made me question everything that I believed about myself - what my personality was, what my flaws were, what my worth was...

She came back 3 days after I found out, saying ""I forgive you for everything that happened in the relationship. I realize now that the positivity you gave me in the relationship is really important to me, and I want that positivity in my life."" 

**Here's where I need you, r/rels.** I love this girl and I have a desire... I have the NEED to love her and take care of her. But I just can't seem to get past the guy she jumped to IMMEDIATELY after. Thought its technically not cheating, to me it's *effectively* cheating, as I feel the same loss of trust, respect... the same absolutely gut wrenching feeling that I'm optional/replaceable, and I feel guilty for giving away my self worth even in the process. If we had done NC, it would have been fine - she's out of my life. But am I wrong to say that this feels like infidelity if she knew she still loved me, missed me, and might want to get back together with me? Am I just being irrational? Should I let this go and give it another shot?

**tl;dr I tried many times to get back together with a girl. After finding out she banged another dude, I decided to move on. Three days later she wants to get back together... but... she banged that dude...and I can't seem to get past it.**

I graduated with a degree in math, and I decided that I would teach myself computer science to get a job as a software developer. I found out that it is pretty tough to break into the industry after I didn't even get a call back on my resume for internships.

I have a general idea of what I want to do, which includes a short QA session and a project where you help me mainly by reviewing my code. This will require a small time commitment of about 5 hours or less over 4 weeks. I got accepted to go to Texas State, but I really wanted to avoid the expensive university education especially since I already taught myself. I would not mind compensating someone for their time.

I graduated with honors with bachelors degree in mathematics, and after taking several computer science courses, I learned that I have a natural intuition for software. I took free online courses from Princeton, Stanford, and MIT, and I also used any resource I could find ranging from wikipedia, textbooks, and blog posts. My experience with coding is mostly small, simple programs and reading source code for some open source projects. I am confident that I have a solid understanding of computer science, but I lack the crediblity to create software that is up to a professional level.

I was hoping to get an internship for the summer, but I did not have much luck since most employers include a requirement for being currently enrolled at a university. On a CV, internships play the role of providing references and verification of professional experience, so after thinking about it for a while, I came up with this idea. I am really excited to take all the theoretical knowledge that I have and begin applying it to the real world.

I have been thinking about building a desktop  for a while and now that I have started my summer internship I think it may be time to start!

I would like to spend around 500$ but am willing to increase a bit for a better performance within reason.

Currently I have a ""Gaming Laptop"" with the following specs

•	Processor Intel 2nd Gen Core i7 i7-2670QM / 2.2 GHz ( 3.1 GHz ) ( Quad-Core )

•	Memory 8.0 GB / 8.0 GB (max)

•	Hard Drive750.0 GB - Serial ATA-300

•	Operating System Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit Edition

•	Display Type 16.4 in TFT active matrix

•	Max Resolution1920 x 1080 ( Full HD )

•	Graphics Processor NVIDIA GeForce GT 540M

•	Optical Drive DVD-Writer / BD-ROM - Integrated


My goal in building this Desktop would be to outperform my laptop with a decent margin. My laptop has cooling issues and tends to framedrop far too much for my liking.

Games I play include Guild Wars 2, Chivalry, CS:GO, ARMA 2 and 3, and hopefully Dayz standalone when it comes out.

I have a mortgage payment and all the other perks that come with being an adult. I have worked for the past 5 1/2 years as a social work clerk for the Department of Public Health in the state that I live in. For about 3 1/2 to 4 of those years, I've been attending a local university working toward my Bachelor's in social work. My employer has allowed me to flex my time to attend any classes that I could not take in the evenings or online. 

This being said, a coworker was allowed to do her internship here on work time for her Master's in social work a year or two ago. She was also granted Educational Leave, as was another social worker who was working on her Master's. I have always assumed, and been led to believe, that I would be given the same treatment. 

I am to go into my internship for the Fall semester, and graduate in December. I am to complete a 450 hour field placement. Wednesdays are all day in class, 9-4. When I approached my supervisor to make arrangements to do my placement here on work time, I was told they no longer do that. When I applied for Educational Leave, I was told that my classification (Administrative Support Assistant II) cannot receive Educational Leave for Social Work. I was then told I could use up my leave, then take leave without pay so that I could keep all of my benefits. After graduation, I would then continue as a clerk until a social work position opened up. (All of this was with the stipulation that I complete all of my required tasks.)

As of Tuesday, I was told I could do my placement here, but I would be cut to 1/2 time, meaning I would make only about 600-700$ a month. My insurance premium would go up to $675, I would lose my seniority, my leave accumulation would go down by 1/2, I would not get my annual longetivity payment, and I would not be guaranteed a full time position in any assignment when I graduated. I was also told that if layoffs occur before the semester starts, I will not be able to do my placement here.

If I continue as an employee here, I will have to drop my insurance, as I will not be able to afford it. In addition to all of the things I lose (which were my reasons for wanting to stay) I will be working 12 hours a day, 5 days a week and 8  hours a day 2 days a week for a total of 76 hours a week for 4 months. Like I said, I have two children, and my husband travels for work.

If I quit, I will be able to draw out almost $10,000 from my retirement. This, in addition to my left-over student loan monies would allow me to personally invest some into an IRA or CD, plus give us money to live off of until I graduate. I figure I'm going to lose my insurance anyway. If I did this, I am hoping the place I did my internship at would hire me, or at least provide a great reference for employment.

So, after giving you all the many boring details...do I stay here, lose everything that had given me reason to want to stay to begin with, and kill myself working and doing an internship for almost 80 hours a week. (which will include missing out on things for the kids.) All of this and I don't even know if I'll have a job in December. Or do I resign with the the knowledge that I will have to use some of the retirement I've saved up, and will have to start all over in a new job and agency when I graduate.

I'm turning to Reddit because my husband, mother, friends, etc. will only say do what I think is right or what I want to do. No one will just give me an unbiased opinion.

There are no busses that go to the facility, as it is actually in Mossville. The closest I can get is the Wal-mart on Allen Rd, but that is still around 7 miles away - so at least a $20 taxi ride each way. 

The facility's address is 14009 Old Galena Road 
Mossville, IL 61656 

If anyone would be kind enough to help me to get to work until my car arrives, it would greatly help me out and relieve this stressful situation. My first day of work is Tuesday from 7:30 to 4:00. I will pay you for your help, but it would certainly be cheaper than taking a taxi or renting a car because I am only 23. I will take a bus closer to you to reduce the traveling. 

So if anyone has some free time and would like to make a little cash it would help me out tremendously. I could also take you out for a beer or something and you could show me around if you'd like.

I graduated last December with a BS in Construction Management and have been trying to find entry level work for the last 7 months.  I have managed land a few interviews with small firms, but no offers.  I graduated with an average for my program GPA of 2.7 and no internship experience.  During my undergrad it was very difficult to find any type of internship in my field because of the recession. It seems that I have found myself in catch 22.  Every company wants at least a few years of experience in their entry level positions and I cannot find any company willing to allow a grad to intern.  I have been volunteering building and rehabbing homes to keep myself busy, but that’s not really relevant experience for an entry level management position.    

I have always have had interest in building and designing so becoming a civil engineer is definitely appealing to me.  The civil eng. program I am considering would take me 2.5 to 3 years to complete.  Being enrolled as student again in an undergrad program would make me eligible to intern and hopefully I’d have an edge with the CM degree.   I do have some concerns though.  I am worried that potential employers would wonder why I decided to get a second bachelor’s in such a closely related field especially if I find myself getting into the project management side of things.  I have also heard there is a pretty hard GPA 3.0 cutoff with engineering if this true I know I will have to bust my ass to bring my GPA up.

I have considered masters programs, but I think I would have a tough time getting in and have also read that in order to take the PE exam you must have a BS in engineering.

If I don’t end up going back to school I have thought about entering the trades, but I feel like that would be wasting the last 5 years of my education.

I just need some advice to help decide my future, any help would be great!

I will probably be living with a few other guys in a house, but I would really like to meet some girls to hang out and get to know and maybe date casually. However, I think the usual recommendation is going to bars/clubs, but I do not drink (personal reasons) and as I'm around more people I tend to get more quiet and introverted. So what do you think would be a good way to meet people for the next few months? Also, what do people think of guys who don't drink even casually? I feel like some people look down or something when I don't drink with them.

Background if you want it: I went through a rough break-up last September after over 3 years of great times. We started dating in high school and it lasted until the beginning of our junior year. It was my only relationship I've ever really had so the college dating thing is new to me. Unfortunately, I didn't take the time to make good friends in my first 2 years, but after a couple of semesters I have gotten to know some good people, but more people I study with and only hang out with occasionally outside the classroom. At this point in college most people have their group of friends which makes me feel like I've wasted some very important years of my life. Despite the rough year, the semester ended on a good note (went on my first date since the break up with an awesome gal and we both had a good time, but things didn't pan out). Now, I'm looking at summer in DC and only a year left before graduating. I don't know the best way to spend this next year. What would you do?

Sophomore in college. Tuition, room/board (campus housing), and a very basic cell phone are 100% paid for by scholarships and my parents.  I will graduate debt-free. I pay for all other expenses (food, textbooks, leisure activities, etc). I go to college in the city, so public transportation paid for by tuition.


**INCOME**: I've made $5-6k each summer for three years. This summer I will earn $8k+ from an internship and tutoring. I worked all throughout high school. I don't work anymore during college.  Since I've always had a lot of money to spend on frivolous things, I've developed bad spending habits. I just don't understand how much things should cost. How much do I spend on food, clothes, entertainment, travel?


According to mint, this is my total spending this year:

* Food: $1038 or $207.60/month.
* Travel: $1155 (spring break)
* Entertainment/shopping/misc: $628 or $125.60/month


So the entire sum of my spendings from January to today is $2821. Not counting spring break, I am spending $333.20 per month. Presently, I have just above $3k in my saving account. I forecast my end-of-the-year spendings to be $6500 at *most*.


 I think that I am in a very lucky financial position right now, but learning to budget would be a good skill to have by the time I graduate because I wouldn't be able to live such a frivolous lifestyle then. At the same time, I look at how much leeway I have right now and it's just so confusing to decide what to cut out. So my questions are basically:


* Can personalfinance offer any advice on how I should think or assess  my financial situation? 
* What is a normal spending plan? 
* What short-term or long-term goals should I consider? 
* What potential problems should I plan for?

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

Yea I know I don’t meet up with my damn Asian stereotypes with my grades but whatever. I had an okay extracurricular profile with some volunteering and internships. The 2 local university admission average was around 83-84% where as the other one is around a low 80%.

I got rejected officially from both of these two universities for the business program (I got into Arts in to one of them). But, I did get accepted in my first choice in my birth town.  What makes me upset is that I wasn’t good enough to enter the universities of my dream. I do not want to go back to my back to birth town and study there (it is so boring and I have no friends and hardly any real family that I can there as most of my immediate family moved here).

I’m angry how you know when people apply out of their city/province/state it is for better or more prestigious program or they want it, but the thing is that I do not want it.  I can't go into Arts since it would be useless to me (and transferring internally is quite difficult/competitive and I don’t want to risk the chance what if I get rejected again from my transfer)  and have no choice but to go back the city my family left. 

Yea I admit I live in a quite competitive city of Vancouver. But, I’m frustrated, it’s not like my grades are so low that I should go to some small College here. I’m not a smart student but I studied hard to hope for the best and during that time I gave up on a lot with friendships and doing stuff I wanted try out. These rejections show that I ain’t good enough and I find it embarrassing that I have to move back to the middle of now where to next province to me, I hate it. I have no motivation to do my damn work anymore or study for my test and don’t know what to do.

Waterloo is well known for its co-op and I wanted to know how well UBC's co-op stacks up against it, in particular in the field of **Computer Science**.

Some questions that I have are:

* How many students take part in the co-op program for Computer Science?

* How often do the companies listed by the CS department (Amazon, Facebook, Google etc) come to hire interns?

* Do start-ups come to visit or is it just the large companies?

* Any other information on how UBC's co-op stacks up with Waterloo's.

As you've probably guessed, this is a deciding factor for me.

I started running and ran my first 5K (time of 29:51 woop woop)!

Last summer I was raped and it's been extremely hard on me and made my depression much worse (its runs in my family. my dad killed himself and so did his mom). However, I didn't cut like I used to. I have not cut once this semester. I am ok.

I ended an extremely unhealthy relationship, borderline abusive, actually. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I didn't go back to him and now I see how mean and horrible he is. 

I got serious about my studies and future career. I started talking to one of my profs and she wrote me an awesome letter of recommendation and invited me to a luncheon at the state house with her and 2 other students she invited. 

I got an internship in DC for 2015.

I started volunteering at an animal shelter.

I met my uncle who I haven't seen since my dads funeral a decade ago and he learned about me and we started talking.

I got the nerve to text this amazing guy I've known for 2 years, but always thought he was out of my league. Next week if our 2 month anniversary :)

And, today, I found out I made a 4.0 this semester. All A's. Through all of this.

I am so proud of myself and I just wanted to share with you ladies. Sorry if this is irrelevant, but I feel so empowered right now and like I can take on the world. I plan to keep making a 4.0 from here on out, so that I can raise my cumulative GPA from a 3.34 to as high as I can get it. I want to volunteer more places. I want to graduate with honors and apply to law school. I also plan on staying in this healthy relationship with a guy who truly loves me and would never do anything to hurt me, emotionally or physically.

Met a great girl (20/F) in January, we hit it off really well. We started dating a week after we met and eventually decided to make it official around March. Just before we made it official, I got a job offer from a prestigious company in my field (Engineering). This position is set to last for 12 months, meaning I'll have to take next year off college. My position will be close to her hometown but around 170 miles away from college. I accepted the job and we talked about doing long distance and she agreed that she wanted to go through with it.

We started doing long distance about 3 weeks ago since I moved out to work and I feel very lonely. I'm so scared about the future because I feel like I've tried to do too many things way out of my comfort zone. This will be the first time in my life that I have legitimately lived on my own in a big city. I have no friends here and no support group and I won't have her here with me.

We are only a 2-3 hour drive away so I am grateful in that regard but I worry that she will be so busy in her Senior year studying (She's trying to become a Doctor so will be applying to Med School) and being around other people that she will forget about me.

I wake up every morning and I have this overwhelming anxiety where I think ""What the hell have I gotten myself into?"" Not only in regards to my relationship with her, but also this job and new life experience.

This is my first proper intern job at an engineering company and I realize how much of an incredible opportunity it is, but part of me just wants to quit immediately and get the fuck out of here so that I can spend another year in college with the girl I care about, rather than having to do long distance. I worry that things won't work out between us during my job and I'll come back to my finish my last year of college with her gone and just painful memories of what could have been. I don't want her to slip away. I don't know how to be strong.

I haven't talked to her about an end date to our long distance because I personally feel it's a little too early, but it would most likely be 2 years from now. I keep fantasizing about how short those 2 years are gonna be and how everything will be fine but then anxiety hits me and I fear for the worst.

When should I take the LSAT?

What sort of volunteer work or extra curricular activities will look good? I currently volunteer at an animal shelter.

If I stay an extra semester and graduate one semester later than planned in order to take extra classes to raise my GPA, would that look better for law school?

How long after graduation should I try to get into law school? I know it's extremely competitive. I was thinking about waiting 5 years or so, but I don't know what I'd do in the mean time. I'm afraid after the gap I'd end up never going :(

Yesterday, I checked my email and saw a notice I'd been added to the group and had full access. Awesome. Then I had to run to the conference center and set up tech for a dinner and promptly forgot about it. 

Today, I went to get on the Sharepoint and was very surprised to see the ""access is denied- contact your admin"" pop up on my screen. My coworker came over to help me troubleshoot. After about 3 minutes of poking around, we realized the problem. I hadn't updated my bookmark, so it was still taking me to the access denied screen.

My current lease is up June 30th and I'm on the lookout for rentals in Old Town or Del Ray. I have had a couple of great finds, but so far I've had no luck finding room mates. Thus, the finds have slipped through my fingers. I would love for this not to happen again. So, if you need to move in this area in June and you're looking for room mates, let's find a place together. 

I am 23 years old, originally from Madison, WI. I currently work at the PTO part time and have a part time internship in the Senate, while applying to grad school. 

I currently live with room mates that I met online, so I have experience working things out with people I don't know at all. I also grew up traveling and living overseas at various times, so working out cultural differences is exciting to me.  I am equal parts friendly and introverted, and love the space to be one or the other when at home. I enjoy great conversation over great food and great drink. (I can be a bit of a beer snob). I also love to watch movies, listen to music (and maybe dance a bit), and read books. I am a consumer of the arts, whether culinary, musical, literary, or whatever.

In terms of living style, I appreciate and prefer talking things out before hand, instead of making assumptions or jumping to conclusions. When everyone knows each others boundries and expectations, there's a lot more room for having fun and building a friendship, and no one feels like they are walking on eggshells. (This is something I am experiencing with one of my current room mates, who prefers not to have conversations regarding money or household responsibilities, even when asked.) The most people normally say in craigslist ads is that they are friendly and flexible. I am taking the risk of sounding less than laid back because I hope to show that I value working things out as room mates, instead of merely tolerating one another.

Some Random Facts:
My favorite TV show is Game of Thrones; I'm currently listening to Young Galaxy, The Knife, The Shouting Matches, and James Blake; My favorite book is Out of the Silent Planet; My favorite movie is It's a Wonderful Life; My favorite play by Shakespeare is The Winter's Tale: and my favorite internet personality is Grace Helbig.

 I would love to get to know you a little better, and see if this would work out.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

And I feel like a lot of places don't. You probably could find work as a bagger at a grocery store, or babysitting, but all states have a LOT of laws about minors working, and generally places don't allow minors to run a register so the jobs are limited. Also be prepared for not a lot of hours since we can only give minors limited hours.

We are a really good company to work for. We care about our employees and are honestly more like a close group of friends than coworkers (At least in my store, and as far as I know it's pretty common). Go in to your local store and ask a manager if they are hiring. Generally we don't post sales associate jobs online. Have open availability and a good attitude. We mostly hire in early july and end of october. We are not allowed to keep on all of our sales associates after holiday hiring, but we keep the best. Show up on time for all shifts and pick up extras if offered to you. We might be the ""fun"" store, but we are run by corporate and expect no less from our employees than say Sears or Macy's.

Teachers/professors, mentors, even people who were in charge of volunteer work you did are good substitutes if you have little to no work history. 
[What happens if you don't have contact with previous employers? I've only had one job before a few years ago and the store has since shut down.

Working and wearing jeans is one thing. You don't have to impress your boss to start your shift every day. But dressing to impress for an interview shows me that you CARE that you get this job. Which implies you will care enough about your job to do it. I don't want to fire you in two months and start the search all over because you can't be bothered to do the things I hired you for.

Nice khakis are perfect. Casual, but you put effort in. Make sure you don't walk in to places with stacks of apps in your hand. If possible, fill them out right away and hand them in so you don't have to let on you're applying everywhere and anywhere.

Otherwise no.  We ask different questions of everyone. Really what we're looking for are honest answers and to get a feel for your personality. If you don't fit personality-wise with our current team, doesn't matter how qualified you are we won't sacrifice our current happy employees for a new one and have everyone be miserable.

If it's close enough to commute to your parents on weekends and keep your job, then tell them you're willing to do that. If not, is it a possibility to stay closer to the college during summer? 
[I go to school in a different state, so no. I told the managers that i would be willing to take a LOA and come back and work during breaks, and that it is my last year of school.

I was going to be left alone with this person a lot and my boss was very much looking out for my well being. 
[Why would someone's personal politics be a factor?  Edit: I get it if someone is going off about ""killin' Obamer"" or something like that, but is sharing harmless pictures or statuses a big thing?

[Would you consider someone who already has a job? I work part-time (weekends only\) and they won't give me anymore shifts, so I need a second job to survive this summer.

1ejjq0,9,2013-05-17,I've been applying to PhD schools for the last 5 years and no acceptance... I'm feeling pretty dejected today... Any advice?,circledrive,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1ejjq0/ive_been_applying_to_phd_schools_for_the_last_5/,"Back-story:

This year will be my 5th year applying for a PhD. I’m not sure what I am doing wrong that I can’t get into anywhere. I have two master’s degrees (unfortunately no thesis and done online). I have had multiple interviews, but never any acceptance letters. At one interview, I was told that I had well written personal statement (unlike this post) and that my ideas for a thesis are great. I’ve also been told several times that I am very qualified. After one interview, I contacted the university, and I asked what my status was. They told me that, although my ideas were good and I was qualified, what I wanted to do could not be done at that university. I want to work on specific project that combines different disciplines (basic idea: using systems biology to discover how cancers escape the immune response).

Stats:

Undergrad GPA: 3.2
Master’s GPA 3.5 -3.7 depending on the calculation
Research: Undergraduate chemical research (didn’t really feel like I was doing much independent thought and contribution, but maybe that’s how most undergrad work is), and an internship (doing basic lab work)
GRE: Quant: 70 something percentile, Verbal: 90 something, Writing 3.0 (kind of messed that up)
References: Undergrad professors and masters professors

Now that you’re filled in what should I do? 

Should I retake the GRE or is it not that important (to me my quantitative score is low for the field I want to join)?

I’ve been trying to find US PIs that fit my research, but haven’t found something that does both the systems biology and the immunology part of what I want to work on for a thesis. Do I need to find somebody’s lab that does pretty much exactly what I want to do, or how does that work? Also, how does funding of a project work for a PhD student?

How should I go about applying for fellowships?

Do I need more research experience, and if so how do I get it?

Should I contact professors and offer to do volunteer work for their lab, or does that come off wrong?

Is there anything else that I should do or know about to get in to a PhD program?

1ejhsi,6,2013-05-17,DIY Tube Furnace,[deleted],DIY,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1ejhsi/diy_tube_furnace/,"I wanted to do a fun, challenging engineering project this summer, and I think I want to to replicate [Jeri Ellsworth's Homebrew Transistors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdcKwOo7dmM). I had toyed with [making an optical glass lens](http://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/1edp8u/diy_lens/), but think this is a better project, partially because I'd like to do a big project with a guideline before trying something without one, partially because I think this will be slightly easier. I know how hard/frustrating this might be, but I'm committed to doing something on this level.

Because I don't have much money or equipment, I'm going to have to make as much as I can on my own. The first step is making the tube furnace. I found a [guy in Germany](http://www.versuchschemie.de/ptopic,168531.html#168531) who says he successfully made one capable of 1300 degrees C, and [another guy](http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=293219) who put together the materials he used/would need.

First off, does anyone know what the limits for a standard outlet are, if any? I know driers have a separate outlet for high current; I suppose I could divert that if I had to.

Second, would I be ok using concrete as an insulator rather than all that ceramic stuff, or is the melting temperature of standard concrete low enough that it would affect the structure at 1200 degrees? (I don't need 1300 degrees). I don't know if spending all that much money on that ceramic tubes, paste and wool would be better than good old fashioned concrete. Will the expansion crack it? If so, why does it work in propane tank backyard foundries?

Finally, does anyone have any instructions on how to build a thermocouple capable of measuring voltage differences at those heats? I figure I can make my own and save a bunch of money (doesn't look that hard to do; just get two different type wires and measure the voltage drop), but I'm worried about the high temperature. I'm also worried about the high current in the temperature control circuit I'll make (I haven't made any circuits with high current before). I assume I just need to be careful about the ratings for any switch I use? (the control circuit would just be an on-off switch).

I'll draw the circuit and upload pictures when I'm done, but it might be a while. I have an internship coming up that'll keep me busy, but I figure I'd ask now to get a more accurate timetable for when I begin. Thankee.

What were your grades like in undergrad?
Classes like Organic Chemistry (1&amp;2), Inorganic, and others, do you use any of these in your job?  Or just simply prerequisites you had to take prior to vet school.

I'm sitting around a 3.5 as a Biological Engineer major (on a 5 year program at my university), and this fall I have to commit to a major.  I'm most likely going to either stay as a Bio-engineer or find a major more Biology based, as that subject I thoroughly enjoy, and I find myself enjoying studying that subject (just finished Macro).  

When you made it into veterinary school, did they focus more on your ""connects"" and what you have done outside of the classroom?

My macro-biology professor whom's grown fond of me this past semester, is going to try and help me get into a internship after I take Biotech in the fall.

Do you enjoy the job (also explain parts of the job you weren't expecting that displeases you)?  Reason I ask is I've owned most types of animals, and starting at a young age, I've just generally been interested in the study of them.  

Can you open up a practice that consists of Birds + your normal domesticated animals (dogs, cats, etc..).  I own a Green-wing macaw and for the last 7 years has become one of my closest friends.  Or is knowledge on medical practice with birds still far behind?  This honestly isn't going to change my inspiration to be a vet, just curious.

My main concerns are the questions before (undergrad / vet school etc.)

On the surface and to most anybody on the outside, this job is something of a fantasy: I'm well paid, my shop is staffed with highly competent people, it's a fun environment with very flexible hours, I have top shelf hardware to work and play with and we get tons of benefits and perks.

There's just one really, really big problem: I'm bored to tears. I literally spend my days watching tutorial videos and dicking around with side projects. There isn't a surplus of work available and most of the guys I work with have been together for years and nobody is particularly eager to put me (a nobody college hire) on their project or accept me into their cliquey little groups. I accepted this job because it appeared to be a challenging environment with an interesting variety of projects, but instead I've just spent most of the past week watching streams from I/O.

Frankly, I don't care how much Dr. Pepper or how many organic apples they feed me--I'm a motivated person who seeks out and enjoys challenges. I came here to work hard and learn while I'm still young and eager; I had several awesome internships that pushed me to my limits and gave me something to hang my hat on. This is different, and I'd give most of this up just to have something substantial to do during the day. I'd happily accept bitch work at this point--I'm not expecting serious responsibilities as a new grad.

It's not just that I'm bored, either--I'm also concerned that I'll inevitably end up with a bad performance review all while my skills erode, leaving me stuck here or fired/marginalized. I moved clear across the country for this and committed myself to a year-long lease, too, so in some sense I'm already trapped. As I mentioned, nobody is responsible for me, so I'm responsible for myself; it's my task to find work. But despite my efforts, I can't, because there simply isn't any going around. So, after just one month, I'm already thinking about heading back out into the job market.

Question is: at what point do I begin to *really* worry, and how bad will it look if indeed I decide to bail after just 2 or 3 months?"

I just got back college and my current SO/hook up buddy is across the country now. I've never done the online thing because it kind of feels 'sad' and that I might be ashamed if anyone found out I had a profile. I have a few questions though.

How discrete is OKC? Are you using your real name or do you create a username? Do jobs search through your OKC profile (I'm trying to intern at some very large companies that do background checks). I really don't want someone to start saying that I used an online dating site because that's pretty damn embarassing for people my age (which is stupid because online dating only makes it easier to meet people who are mutually attracted).

I'm 19 and I'm an attractive male, do women tend to look for only older guys? I mean I've never had a problem hitting it off with women my age but I feel like OKC is only used by older females. And from my experience, females want nothing to do with guys if they're even 12 months younger. Hell, I can't even legally drink (although i'm 21 in Arizona though.. eh ;)? How does that come off?

I've been hooking up with a girl from college for the past 6 months.. is this morally wrong? In the last month or two we've pretty much settled exclusively, but the months before I was hooking up with other girls (she hooked up here or there I believe, not frequently). I don't know what's going to happen next year with her, but I'm not ready to settle in a relationship. I'm just afraid she'll find out that I used online dating in the summer and for her to get pissed.

I graduated in May 2011 with a Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering from a top university in the US and have a lot of experience with UAVs, more specifically doing design work and some flight testing. I have two summer internships and 1.5 years of full time experience.


I am looking for some general career advice because I am currently struggling on deciding what to do with my life. 


I want to work in the Aerospace industry but right now almost all of the companies that I am interested in are either on a hiring freeze or don't seem to be hiring much. I am worried that the longer I wait the more obsolete I become and the less likely I am to get hired. I am also getting tired of not working and just staying at home waiting for companies to hopefully get back to me. 


My other good option right now is to go work at an Automotive company were I'll be making good money and be in a rotational program which could mean learning a lot of great skills. The other advantage is that I wouldn't have to move so my wife wouldn't have to leave her current job and we would have about twice the income than we would if we had to move. However, I don't know if I should pursue this option right now or wait because what I truly want to do is Aerospace. Also, working in Automotive makes me nervous in terms of job security for the long term. 


Part of me wants to just say ""screw it"" and work at the Automotive company right away so that I can continue my career and start making money but another part of me wants to wait so that I can land an awesome job working on things that I am truly passionate about.


**If you were in my position, how long do you think you would wait before pursuing the alternate option of applying for the job at the Automotive company?**


**How long do you think is too long to be unemployed and why do you think this?**


Any comments, feedback, and opinions are welcome. Thank you in advance."

1ej7vk,5,2013-05-17,I hate doctors,beaniepie,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1ej7vk/i_hate_doctors/,"**TL:DR** I met my OB for the first time and do not like her but apparently I'm not allowed to switch.

I just had my first appointment with the OB my family doctor referred me to on Tuesday and I was just unhappy with her. I found her to be very condescending and treating me like I was dumb and honestly, I was rather offended. She also had a med intern there, which was a surprise to me. Some people might be ok with it, but I'd rather not have an intern there and feel like a case study as she pauses every 5 mins to explain things to the intern. 

Basically, there are 11 OBs who work in that group at the hospital. You only regularly see one but could potentially have any of the 11 on the day of the birth, just whoever happens to be working that day (as in, your OB will not try to come in that day if that day is not on their regular schedule). I don't like it but fine, if that's the way it has to be. Anyway, I called my family doctor and asked to be referred to a different OB in the group but apparently they can't do that because if you've seen one already, another one won't see you. 

That's absolutely ridiculous to me. I don't want two OBs. I want a different one because I had a negative experience. I saw her one time and now I can't switch? I asked if I could be at the other hospital (thankfully I live in an area that has more than one) where it's a group of OBs and you see them all so hopefully this works out. I'm actually more ok with that. At least I get to meet them all.

Either way, I didn't want an OB at all. ALL the midwiferies were full and I'm on waiting lists for all in my area. I'm just getting really frustrated because I feel like I have no choices. Not my first, which was a midwife, not my second, which would be a great OB who is actually there on the day of the birth. I'm so not liking the idea of not having the same person who provides prenatal care not being there at the birth (which is why I wanted a midwife to begin with). I understand if they had to be away on vacation, but there would only be a small chance of that... Not a 2/11 chance, depending on their schedule. 

Why do people think Canadian healthcare is something special? So very frustrated..."

I guess i'm wondering, has anyone ever worked on these types of accounts before even though you were morally opposed to it? How did it turn out for you? What were the benefits and what did you get out of working on this account?

and lastly, how will I be able to turn this experience around and get the most out of this experience? (as you can guess, i've just been placed on one of these accounts, but as a summer intern I dont exactly have the freedom to say I want a different one, especially since I need this experience)

Since I feel my involvement might not require too much of my time, I was considering learning CAD at home during free time (because I never had to learn it and know it's importance). My first thought was to find AutoCAD on TPB, download it, and look up how-to videos on YouTube and/or find a manual.

I am 22 years old and about to graduate from college and I have been with the same guy (24) on and off for almost two years.  

When I first met him, I was strong and fiercely independent.  I loved life.  I was excited to go to school every morning.  I had been working out and eating healthy.  I had the internship of my dreams.  I met this guy and he was gorgeous and he seemed like he was really interested in me.  We were both talking to other people in the beginning, but we ended up being exclusive.  Whenever we went out together, if someone hit on me, he would call get angry.  He would say that they were only looking at my boobs and that I was a slut.  He hated that I had male friends.  He never had friend girls and he started getting closer to them to make me jealous.  Eventually, I stopped talking to my best friends and he just continued.

I have caught him on several occasions talking to other girls on Facebook.  Once over Christmas break and once on my birthday telling them that he wanted to see them and that he was sorry he couldn't.  He said that he would ""make it up to them"" which he always used to say to me.  He got a DUI and I ended up driving him everywhere.  

He got mad and he hit me.  We were both drunk but I remember him pulling my hair and dragging me across the house.  Then, he bagged up my things and he threw them on the porch and I ran and hid behind a bush and I cried until he found me.  He didn't apologize, he just asked, ""Are you going to tell all your friends that I am some evil guy now?  Are we never going to talk again?""  And I told him that I wouldn't mention it again.

We were supposed to take a trip to Paris, I had bought our tickets.  His parents said that he couldn't go (his parents are a little bit crazy) and we got into big fights about it because we had talked about it for so long.  We eventually broke up.  He slept with another girl the week that we were supposed to be in Paris.  He decided to go on a boys trip to Myrtle Beach instead and he invited an old fling. 

We ended up getting back together.  I blocked his number but it didn't go through AT&amp;T for some reason and he called everyday and texted and apologized saying that he would change and that he could never be happy without him.  I broke down sobbing and took him back.  

His parents are both irrational and controlling and he manipulates them the same way that he manipulates me.  My dad is absent and my mom is emotionally and was extremely physically abusive.  He has had terrible relationships where his exes have cheated on him and had abortions.  I am no saint either.  I hit him after I found out he slept with another girl.  We have physically fought several times.  

The past few months have been different.  He graduated before me and all of his friends are gone.  We have spent practically everyday together.  He just moved for a job (hundreds of miles away) and I was trying to see him.  I know that I am being impatient and he gets angry with me when I ask when I can visit because he has to run it by his parents who do not like guests.  I freaked out and called him over and over when he was visiting his cousin because I know they drink so heavily together and I got really insecure.  He got upset because he was trying to hang out with his family that he had no seen for a while so he has not spoken to me in 3 days.  He always does this when he gets upset and when I ask him if we can have a better line of communication, he dismisses me as crazy.  He says that I am too insane to deal with and he just needs to block me out when I am acting this way.  I was hospitalized twice for overdoses last summer.  I have never been a depressed person.  I was always so happy and motivated but for the past two years, I have felt absolutely defeated.  I don't know how to explain it but sometimes, it physically hurts.  Like my chest just aches from my sadness and I would do anything to make the pain go away.  It gets to the point sometimes that every minute feels like an hour.  I can barely sleep at night, I feel so anxious.  I feel like it was my fault this time.  I shouldn't have called him 5 times when he was hanging out with his cousin.  I should have just let him have his space and now he is ignoring me for days at a time...again.  I don't know who to turn to because I was such a burden last summer on my friends and they got so worried.  I have apologized just to get it over with but he is punishing me so that I don't act this way again.  I have tried leaving him before but it is so hard.  I feel even more depressed without him.

edit: I am so tired of fighting.  I am so tired of feeling sad.  I just want everything to be okay."

After the most recent project, I went on vacation, came back, and have not received any new requests for work in a month.  I a curious how to handle this, or whether I should at all.

We didn't set any actual terms such as a defined period where I would work for them, but rather an ad hoc as-needed basis whenever they had overflow from their office.  I fulfill a very specialized skill that they said they used to have someone in house to do, but that person left and they were so busy they were just sending it to me.  It is possible that they have an intern now who does this, or that they just don't have any work, or some other reason why I am not hearing from them.  I have a personal connection with the client as I have some friends who work there - a friend brought me in on the first job - but I don't want to straight up ask one of them to try and find out what's going on for me.  

I would love to continue working with them, and my gut reaction is to just hang out and see if I hear from them again, but I'm interested if anyone has other thoughts about how they have handled this in the past.  I do have other work, but I just really enjoyed every aspect of working with them."

Kind of a long story short but I'll give you the **tl;dr** version. Went to college for Computer Technology, got an internship in the UNIX/AIX department with very little Linux experience. Through the summer I learned a lot and worked hard so they offered me a job right out of college (hell yea) so I had to take it. Now being with the company for over a year I know a lot of the basics of a UNIX/Linux, but I've felt like I've been a little cheated. How I learned was people showing me what to do, and from there I kind of had to guess why it happened and why it worked that way, think of it as reverse  learning.  Now that I've gotten more into UNIX (it's really catching on to me) I would like to go back to the ""roots""  and start over and learn the OS from the ground up. 



So from reading/hearing a lot of cool stuff that people are doing with their raspberry pi's I think it would be a great opportunity form me to tinker around with Linux and learn a little more in depth knowledge about Linux and even about programming.



Well I just found out that Micro Center sells them, I work about 5 minutes away from one. So I'm going to jump right in and get my feet wet. I was just wondering what the most basic essentials I will need to run it, and if anyone has any good recommendations. I heard that you should buy multiple SD cards so have for different projects, I think I'm just going to start off with one for now. But I have my computer monitor and TV that I plan on working on it with. I have a mechanical light-up keyboard, should I be worried about the power consumption of it? I have two 10 feet HDMI cables laying around. Might pick up a USB flash drive for more storage. I have multiple USB power cables and wall plugs from my android phones I own.  I'm just not sure if I've over looked anything.



So if you could any advice or recommendations would be great!


Oh and I forgot to add I would like to pick everything up from Micro Center, unless there is a big price difference or better technology that I can buy somewhere else. "

[How long do you plan to keep doing all this YouTube stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca06w0h?context=5)|3-5 more years unless I die in an airplane or my girlfriend poisons me or something with aliens. ...god damn aliens.
[How do you plan to end your channel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca07374?context=5)|With a wave and a wink.  I was much more dramatic about it in the early years but I dont even know what my life is without YouTube.  I'll always be around but its just the show wont always exist.  I feel like Im in this big worldwide stupid loving and occasionally racist family.  Don't want to lose that.
[What would you like to do after you finish up with YouTube then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca07acd?context=5)|Travel and staring at japanese girls.
[Hey Phil. Whats been your most memorable interaction with a fan?

Thats all I'll say.
[Do you think Youtube will ever hit its peak or just continue to get bigger? If so, when?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca0782m?context=5)|I hope not.  I do get worried because I think they are going to push Google+ so hard they may alienate some users but lucky for them they are THE SOURCE of videos.  The only time I use anything else is when some artsy content producer uses Vimeo.  YOUTUBE is it!
[Some dirt on other YouTubers please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca06vz4?context=5)|A few years ago I probably would have ripped apart a few youtubers but these days I keep out of the dramatastic YouTube and stick to the creative/businessy YouTube.
 |That being said Lee Newton and Trisha fart so much they have ruined all women for me.
[If right now you had to quit Youtube and start another career, which one would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca06z6g?context=5)|So probably the 2nd one :)

[Will SourceFed Nerd primarily focus on Trisha, Meg, and Steve? If so, how often will Lee, Elliot, and Joe be involved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca078ni?context=5)|There will be a nice balance as well as the introduction of a few new faces as part timers at first.  For us NERD is where the fun happens.
[What kind of pranks do you guys ( people of Sourcefed \) play on each other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca075f8?context=5)|Steve's idea of a prank is showing me his balls.  ITS HILARIOUS...for him.  Disgusting for me.  The rest of the hosts are too scared of me to prank me but thats probably because of the constant lashings they get for looking me in the eyes.
[What is the best piece of advice you have ever received from anyone? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca071ug?context=5)|Don't be the first when you can be the best.  
[Since you started the show it's evolved from ""The show that's not really a show but me talking to a camera for 3-4 minutes (yeah.. yeah..\)"" to a show that's now usually at least double that length. Do you see yourself going even longer than this to a show that's 15 minutes or longer every day or do you think you've struck a good balance in terms of video length?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca076jr?context=5)|I dabble with the long form now and then.  I've been playing with the idea of having guests and segments (something similar to a late night show).  We'll see.  The future is looking pretty bright right now.  I usually stay under 10 minutes because its very easy to over stay your welcome on YouTube.

Does it get hard (pun intended\) to stay behind the line of appropriate behavior?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca07jsr?context=5)|No.  The girls are like family here.  Linz and I are great.  You get comfortable in a relationship where you just trust the other person.  Not that ignorant/lazy trust but that we respect each other and would never do anything to hurt the other trust.  It takes time and arguing but once you get it its so great.
[Hey Phil!  What are your thoughts on a DeFranco Does Ottawa? (And/or Toronto\) Also, of all your BAMF and douchebags of the day, who would you say is the top in each category? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca06x1v?context=5)|We've had serious talks about Toronto.  Its all been delayed because we were waiting on a sponsor who just fell through because they had their budget slashed.  We might arrange something on kickstarter for a DeFranco/SourceFed tour but it wont be for a bit.
[How do people get hired to work at Sourcefed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca0796k?context=5)|Most start as interns who apply at Internsushi.com.  The rest are robots we manufacture in house.
[Any chance you leave Youtube and host all your content on your own website?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eh81a/youtuber_philip_defranco_ama/ca076ah?context=5)|Only if one day I was like I should do the worst thing I could possibly do.  Then I would totally do it.

When school is in session and we're rocking awesome views Im on top of the world and when finals roll around and the views take a dip I get sad but I have friends and family that keep me in check.  I don't know if I'll ever feel like I MADE IT!!!  We'll see.

article code 85230150609THG

This blog was written by Alexa Sibio, of North Caldwell, who is a staff accountant at Smolin Lupin who completed her first tax season this year. 
April 16 is a day that will live in infamy. People who are not in the accounting industry figure April 15 is a much more significant day, but I just completed my very first tax season at Smolin Lupin and, as an accountant, I can tell you April 16 feels as if I finally crossed the finish line.
During my studies at Montclair State University, I interned at Turner Construction Company in New York City over the course of three years. My internship was very exciting and I was able to learn a lot about the profession, however, I never worked a tax season at an accounting firm.Sure, I heard a lot about the challenges from my professors, but I never gave it too much thought. I am an extremely focused person who is unafraid of hard work, so I figured, ""How bad can it be?""Needless to say, I now realize I slightly underestimated the situation.
There is no point in trying to detail the long hours, fast-paced and intense environment of an accounting agency in tax season, because the only way to fully grasp it is to experience it for yourself.Still, if I had to describe it, it felt like I started a marathon in February and then in March I had to sprint uphill until mid-April.  Yet tax season wasn’t the monotonous grind of a marathon, there were surprises as well, such as the old adage ""communication is key."" It is critical to keep everyone who is involved with a particular engagement updated on the status of the job.However, communication with the client is just as important as communication within the firm. At Smolin, our policy is to keep the client happy and I do whatever it takes to meet that requirement. It sounds easy, but keeping everyone informed of what you’re doing, while everyone is sprinting uphill to complete a marathon is a real challenge, especially when juggling multiple tasks at once.   
They say it takes over your life. I suppose the moment I realized my life had been completely taken over by busy season was a rare weekend afternoon when I was relaxing at home. I picked up a tabloid figuring my brain could use a little fluff and started reading a piece on ""who wore it best."" Midway through the article, I caught myself calculating how much of a write off these dresses would be, what tax code would apply and what I needed to be careful of in their return.I conceded defeat, threw the magazine out and decided a bowl of ice cream was the best mental relaxation.Tax season is a really challenging experience. I learned a lot and contributed to Smolin Lupin’s clients and the firm as a whole. And dare I say I’m actually looking forward to next tax season. I’ll be working with a great group of colleagues, superb mentors and, perhaps, a recent graduate in their first tax season, uphill marathon sprint.

I'm entering business next fall and I interested in joining in AIESEC but I'm wondering if you guys can provide any advice or answer my questions. I tried looking at one of the clubs website but everything was very genetic.

1. Does it matter what year I'm in, in order to join?
2. Do you have any advice on how can I have the best AIESEC experience?
3. How much do the exchanges cost? (so can I start saving for plane tickets, housing and food)
4. When should I do my exchange? After my first year, second year, third year, etc?
5. What do you do as a general member?
6. How do I move up the ranks? hehehe
7. Where did you go on your exchange and what did you do?
8. To go on an exchange, do you have to have skills already developed in your internship (for example I'm interested in accounting) ?
9. Are there volunteer opportunities with the local clubs?
10. I'm a very shy person would joining this club help me or be opening?

We have 17 employees but we would like to have things more under control. As of now we are looking for some Sales and Marketing interns and full time, until we find the ninja we are looking for, we are building our own plans.

The marketing plan is done, now we are tackling the sales plan. We looked around, but most of the information we found was about products not web services. Any sources, advice or steps we should take to have it good enough to go forward?

(By web services I mean about development (Node.js, Angular.js, Python, etc.), scalability, performances and consulting)"
1ei4ih,5,2013-05-17,Did I blow my second interview? Need some insight from experienced interviewers or interviewees,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ei4ih/did_i_blow_my_second_interview_need_some_insight/,"I went in for my second interview for a summer internship with a company in the telecommunications industry. From the start the manager told me to sit at a table next to her desk, and I sat in her seat apparently (there were papers in the front of the seat I sat in, which ended up being her interview questions).


My main concern in that I did not articulate my answers correctly. Here are some of the answers I am concerned about.


Tell me about yourself? I stated basically my professional strengths.She said she wanted to know more about my personal interests. I said I like recording music and have experience in logic and pro tools.


She asked for three strengths, weaknesses, and three things I wanted to get out of the internship. I gave three solid strengths, but stumbled for a third weakness and what I would get out of the internship(said wanted a experience in the telecommunications industry,wanted experience dealing with strategic/target marketing,  and experience in a professional environment)


She also asked what my friends and work colleagues would say about me. I was completely thrown off guard(did not prepare for those questions) and started with my friends would say I am a nice guy(Probably the most honest answer, but she laughed and I followed it up with I am loyal and easy to talk to). As for work colleagues I basically re-stated my strengths (hard working, motivated, come in everyday wanting to learn).


The real worrying answer I gave was to the question, you are not a marketing major, so what marketing experience do you have(communications and Poly Sci with IT Minor). I stated I am an expert in people because of my field of study, and I have some experience in direct marketing with my previous jobs. Of course with extra words thrown.


She then said many of questions were to determine if I would be a better fit in the analysis or creative side of the marketing department based on that typically people are one or the other but very rarely both. Then asked if I had any questions, which I was well prepared for.


I nailed many of the questions that I didn't mention, but I am worried I may have come off as unprofessional or immature based on the poor ones. She told me I would hear back in two weeks(starts June 1) because they were interviewing a few other people and she would be out of town, and ""wished me luck"". She also did not ask for references. Is this me being paranoid or did I really have a poor showing."
1ei3tp,0,2013-05-17,I'm not sure I [21m] should stay with my on and off girlfriend [20f],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ei3tp/im_not_sure_i_21m_should_stay_with_my_on_and_off/,"I'm just going to call her my girlfriend to make it easier. 

We've been dating on and off since grade 11, and it's now the end of our 3rd year of university, for a total of 5 years.

As it currently stands I'm in Computer Engineering at one of the best Universities in Canada and she lives in the same town as me but is in Early Childhood Education at a different university. If you can't figure out by our problems - we're both totally unable to meet members of the opposite sex.

Our story goes like this: I met her back in grade 11 English class. She was the quiet short Brazilian girl that sat beside me. As I began to know her more, she revealed that she had a long distance relationship with some disabled guy who lived in England. It mostly seemed like she only dated him because she was lonely and I ended up convincing her to break up with him so that I could date her. 

We were sort of in different social groups, I was always somewhat popular and she was always hanging around with the quiet asian kids. My friends always told me that I should dump her because I'm too attractive for her, and that she's not good enough for me. I mostly just dated her because I was extremely depressed and I didn't really like any of my ""friends"", but I really liked her. I stopped talking to a lot of my friends in order to date her. She was extremely quiet and not very ambitious or intelligent - she ended up with high 60s in high school, whereas I ended up with high 80s.

Despite all that that we dated without issue for about 2 years until university.

During first year university I basically lost interest after I started to meet girls who were much more attractive and had more in common with me. I slowly began telling a close friend of mine that I lost interest in her, and that I had developed feelings for other girls. He, of course, told her immediately. She eventually sent me an email saying that we should break up - and I felt oddly relieved for some reason.

I ended up hanging out with a few of the girls I liked but nothing really came of it. I became extremely depressed like how it was in high school and we ended up getting back together in February of 1st year (2011) after a few tough months.

We dated without issue until 2nd year, where I became extremely bored of her again. I met another girl who I found interesting through a mutual friend. I hung out with this mutual friend (female, no feelings) and the other girl a while before deciding that I liked her. I ended up breaking up with my girlfriend, drunk, at a bar in order to date this other chick. We made out a couple times, but I never really felt the spark that I felt with my girlfriend. It sort of never worked out with that chick. I also ended up sleeping with a friend of mines ex-girlfriend (long story). I ended up getting back together with my girlfriend in May of that year and had no issues until 3rd year.

tl;dr of the shit I said above: We broke up twice after I met other girls I liked more, but it never worked out with them.

When we got back together it never was as good as it was the first time. She always seemed disappointed. She ended up revealing that she had also slept with someone else and that she now had elevated sexual standards. As it turns out I have premature ejection issues (self diagnosis, don't judge me, fuck you) and I could never sexually please her in the same way that that guy did.

We broke up again during January of this year and just got back together recently. The issue is, we only have sex about once a month now, whereas it was a lot more before.

She's currently stressed out about a co-op placement she has, and I have a summer internship at a well-known tech firm which pays well. I see her several times a week but I feel like it's just not the same as it was before.

Long story short, whenever we're together we're miserable, but when we're apart we're even more miserable. I'm just wondering if these things will stabilize or if I should just dump ship and put up with being depressed for an undetermined amount of time before I find someone else. I've tried online dating to no avail, and none of my friends know any Women who I find attractive.

**tl;dr** Broke up with my girlfriend 3 times. Still dating her. Can't seem to meet any other women. Extremely depressed when I'm single. Shyness issues. Not sure what I should do. Obvious answer is break up again, but that never worked before.

Other shit I should mention: Her family and friends hate me. She told them I'm an asshole after the 1st and 2nd time we broke up, and now they won't talk to me. She also told a lot of my friends, so as it currently stands, I have zero high school friends I currently talk to besides her."

We're really understaffed right now, but they're hiring on new people to work the line. Apparently I'm going to be getting an 11th grader, an intern, and one of the dishwashers (who does not want to work the line) to train. Right before the summer/tourist season opens. Yippee.

1ei26t,15,2013-05-17,"How long out of college without any work experience until my degree ""expires"" in the eyes of employers?",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ei26t/how_long_out_of_college_without_any_work/,"I graduated last May with a bachelor's in civil and environmental engineering. I was never able to get so much as an interview for an internship, so all I have to offer is a 3.5 GPA and other academic awards.

So with no luck there, I went into a master's program for journalism, which is actually what I want to do in life. I graduate this August. Since I never had a free summer, I haven't had an internship in this field either, though I have worked many jobs as a student journalist at college publications or had my school work published in local publications.

I'm applying for full-time reporter jobs, with no luck so far. I'd gladly take an internship in the fall if I was able to land one that doesn't require me to still be in school. If none of that works, then I would move on and try to start a career in engineering. 

All this has applying has me wondering, is my engineering degree effectively useless at this point now that I am more than a year removed from that degree and anything engineering-related? If I were to apply for an entry-level job or an internship in engineering, would employers even consider me as an option (not that they ever did, but you get the idea)?

I just worry that since I filled the last year with a completely different focus instead of only job hunting for engineering, they might think I'm not serious and never take a chance on me. What do you think?"

Will I be able to be CPA eligible in the same time span as doing my Master's? I'm not too familiar with the Master's route but it usually takes 1 year. I should be able to take 30 credits in a year... isn't that just 10 classes?

1ehzmp,1,2013-05-17,Bad decision? Or reasonable?,wnxgastank,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ehzmp/bad_decision_or_reasonable/,"Hello Reddit,

So I'll give you a little background on the situation:
- Graduated from a top 30 University with a 3.6 GPA (last week)
- Major in Finance with minor in International Business
- No internship; however I worked throughout all my college life (usually 30 hours) including a semester as a TA in a class of 1,400+
- Lead 3 clubs at my University and am part of honor societies

Now to get to the meat of the situation. I've had many interviews. By many, I mean give or take 20 (not THAT many, not a few either). A few weeks ago I got an offer at lets just say; Company A. Company A offered a decent salary, but only has 10 employees, and their line of work (or industry) is not really what I want to do. I declined their offer because I had interviews with Company B and Company C, both of which are perfect jobs, pay well, advancement opportunities, employ well of 100,000+. Company B then flew me down to Florida for an interview, and the other company paid for me to stay in NY and interview. 

Do you think it was unreasonable of me to decline? Did I shoot myself in the foot here? I already asked for an extension from Company A, however they only gave me a week, def. not long enough for any other company to get back to me.

TL;DR: Got an offer, declined. Did I make a mistake?"

1ehwij,2,2013-05-16,Tips on coming out.,GrundlesGalore,gaymers,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/1ehwij/tips_on_coming_out/,"Hey guys,

I am writing here because, quite frankly, I don't have any gay friends that I really feel comfortable with. /r/gaymers was one of the reasons I created a Reddit account in the first place, and I've learned a lot from you guys simply by lurking about, seeing other people's situations as they unfold. Hopefully you guys won't mind me asking a question, but as I said above, I don't really feel like I have anyone else I could really ask.

Anyway, I am gay, and have known it since around 8th grade. I am comfortable with my sexuality, and would be comfortable with it if I find myself changing my mind later in my life. Not saying I will, but I believe that sexuality is fluid, and admit that I am not very emotionally competent, if that makes any sense. I am about to turn 21, and will be the first to admit that I have a lot to figure out in my life. I have a pretty normal life, and have never felt like anyone (other than myself) has looked down on me just for being gay. I've wanted to tell my folks about it for a while, but did not want to broach the subject until I was certain about myself (which is a bit silly, in retrospect, but that was my rationale at the time). After much dating, experimenting etc., I feel sure enough with my sexuality that I can have a conversation with my folks about it. 

However, the situation is a bit unique, and I'm unsure how to approach it. My Mom knows that I am gay, and is pretty comfortable with it. She found out when she walked in on my boyfriend and I, awkwardly attempting to have sex during my high school days. Talk about awk. Now though she seems totally find. We even talk about boys sometimes, which I think is pretty awesome. My Dad also knows, but only because my Mom told him first. Apparently this happened about a year ago, so it's had some time to settle in his mind. Even though he already knows it second-hand, I feel like it's important for me to talk to him about it, both for my personal development, and out of respect for my Dad.

I just had a kick-ass semester and landed an awesome internship with the federal gov't in DC this summer, so I feel like now would be the best time to talk to him about it; while my stock value is high, so to speak. I just don't really know how or when to broach the subject, especially since it's already been half discussed. So I'm kinda confused.

TL;DR I am trying to come out to my Dad, who already sort of knows that I am gay. How should I approach talking to him?

**EDIT:** Thanks guys! I had a talk with him the other day, and it was one of the most open talks I've ever had with my Dad. The talk we had was serious, because he was reminding me of the societal biases I will face, but comforting, because he assured me that I would never have any of the bias at home. I really respect him for that, knowing that his whole family is born/raised in Arkansas."

Start of my story I guess. I am 20 years old. I grew up in a decent sized town called Parkersburg, WV. Every since I was in 7th grade I've battled a growing depression starting with a teacher who told me my goal of being an Aerospace Engineer was stupid and that I should look for something closer to home. I was a straight A student... until that point. I started slacking, not caring.

When I was in high school I didn't apply myself at all. I graduated with a 2.98, not because I didn't know the material, but because I had stopped caring. By that point I'd decided I wanted to be an IT because I had fallen in love with doing computer work. I took the ACT, nooked a 28, and landed a scholarship at DeVry.

After looking things over I decided I wanted to major in Computer Engineering. My aunt helped me land a job at SIS as an intern IT and I moved to Columbus. I got an apartment through DeVry with other students (they don't have housing). All was fine, I loved my job, I loved my classes.

I lived in that apartment for about 3 months. The roommates who at first seemed pretty cool turned out to be douchebags. They would just be general douchebags and then they would drink and smoke and turn into even worse douchebags. It finally got to the point where I couldn't handle it. I called the housing rep and talked to her about it and she moved me from Pickerington to Grove City to live with a different set of students.

These guys were really cool. I hung out with them a decent amount while I was at home and typically enjoyed there company. We had that one sketchy roommate that really bugged me though. He was never home when I was and just always seemed off. First I started noticing little things missing.

The night before Christmas break I got the last $50 out of my account so I could fill up my tank and go home to be with my family. I left that money under my keyboard while I went to work. When I got home from work that money was gone. The other 2 roommates had already left the weekend before that to be with their family and he was gone. I knew he had taken it. I had a friend drive all the way from the outskirts of Hilliard to give me gas so I could go back to WV to be with my family for Christmas.

Upon returning home after Christmas break I found that my laptop was gone. He had come home and taken a $1,200 laptop and ran off with it. I was furious. I packed all my shit and moved it to my cousins house over night whom I'd called as soon as I got home and found that. I called the next morning to tell the housing person that I was giving up and I was leaving their services. I spent all my extra money to break the lease and got out.

While this was happening in that apartment I was starting into programming classes. I decided that I hated programming with a passion and I wanted to just switch to an IT or Cisco program because that's what I enjoyed. Well DeVry didn't offer what I wanted so after finding out I had to ditch that apartment as well I decided that I would just find a different school to go to.

I was advised that Strayer University was a good school. I went and talked to them and everything seemed cool. I got classes scheduled and got to work taking only online classes that semester. Well I started getting calls from Strayer wanting me to pay so much money right then for this loan and what not. They continued to dick around with me and I knew I needed out before they ate all my money. I'm still getting calls from them trying to collect money that I shouldn't owe because of deferment.

At this point I gave up. I'd been living with my cousins for 6 months and had tried my hardest to find another place to live. I still had my job, which I loved and payed well. I was having no luck finding another place to live and I just finally decided I needed to move back home, go to WVUP (a branch off of WVU) and live around my old friends and family.

Bad idea. All of my good old friends are gone. The few that are still here never want to do anything anymore. My family has helped me out financially some when I need it but overall has just been driving me up the walls. They hound me constantly about not having a job. I've been applying literally everywhere. I either never get a reply or they refuse to work around a school schedule. I'm not happy. I've gotten myself into a slump where I don't have money and I can't do anything about it. I've had my phone shut off for several months and I recently shut off my internet.

I had a roommate for 2 months. She bailed on me a month ago without paying me the rent that she owed me from the month before (which her dad finally gave me a couple days ago) and without a notice. I was stuck, I only had the money planned out for half until my next set of student loans and the rest had been used doing things with my girlfriend.

I now realize that I made the worst decision in my life. I moved back home where I felt like I would feel comfortable and I let myself get to comfortable. I let my parents help me out here and there and lost all the motive that I had when I lived away and was completely fending for myself. I left a great job and all my great opportunities back in Columbus. I left the good friends that I had met and grown very fond of when I'd lived there.

At this point I realize that I should have probably just switched to OSU and stayed working at my old job. I left on very good terms and believe that I would have a high possibility of getting back on there. If not I feel as though I would be able to find something before I moved back up there because there are so many more job opportunities in the area. I need to be back to where I am forcing myself to hold a budget and I am fending for myself.

The major problem I have left is money... I have nothing. I have $15 and an empty gas tank. I have 2 months left on my lease and I owe my mother $165 for the utilities I couldn't pay this month. Even if I decided to do all this and I got a job lined up and classes scheduled I would be screwed trying to find a place to live. I don't have money for a deposit and I don't have money to pay out my lease here. 

So basically what I'm saying here is I don't know what to do. This isn't a plea for help, this isn't me begging for a couch to piggyback on, this isn't me trying to get a load off my chest (even though it kinda is helping xD). This is just me trying to get an opinion from some people who live in the area and are fairly well educated (I mean... it is Reddit) and have been through more than me.

TL:DR - I had shit luck with roommates here and there. I'm not happy with the direction I'm heading right now and I want to get back on a forward direction. I'm poor and I'm not sure if there is a way I can make this a reality. What should I do?"

1ehi1t,1,2013-05-16,What's under my seeming alcohol problem?,help___throwaway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ehi1t/whats_under_my_seeming_alcohol_problem/,"I think I may have a problem with alcohol and other substance abuse. It's really weird too because my life seems to be going great on the surface. I'm 20 years old, going to be a junior studying abroad in Europe next fall, and have a really good programming internship for the summer. My family is really proud of me. I had been drinking heavily each weekend at college with my friends, and it seemed pretty normal but looking back it was definitely picking up towards the end. Everyone else kind of just saw me as the typical college ""bro"" drinker guy. I still got really good grades and stuff, but I always went the hardest on the weekends.

Ever since I moved in to my own apartment for the summer, I've been getting drunk every night for about two weeks. At first it just kind of felt like I was celebrating my newfound freedom, I could drink whenever I wanted to since I have a fake ID, etc.

But at this point it seems like it could be becoming a habit, and it's really worrying me. I just come home at 5, make dinner, and then drink for the rest of the night until I go to sleep. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? What is going on? I know I might have a problem with substances - I've gone through small periods of pills (opiates, amphetamines), chewing tobacco, etc. in the past, but it just seems to be whatever I can get ahold of at the time, and it would stop whenever the supply ran out.

I feel like I'm running from something. I don't know. Has anyone been in a similar situation? I don't know what to do."

I'm a 24 year old male, living in Chicago.  I've never had a job, I never went to college, I've never dated in my life or even been kissed on the cheek, and hell **I don't even know how to drive (which I'm so humiliated about, it kills me.  I lie to everyone that I have one, and I've cut off friendships for fear of them finding out).**  I'm stuck in a rut, and every day I'm more convinced that I'll never get out of it, and that my future holds nothing good.  I've been totally depressed for 10 years now, and I don't know where to even begin getting my life in order.  I've been plagued with horrible, horrible sleep problems for at least 20 years also, and I think that might be a major cause of it.

I spent several years after high school pursuing a career in Audio Engineering.  I realize now I was very half-hearted about it and didn't do ANYWHERE NEAR as much as I should have, due to depression and no motivation for the last 10 years.  But it wasn't until after about 3 years of self-studying that I started emailing audio school graduates and studios and everyone I could for advice or even an internship, that I had a big wake-up call and learned how absurdly lucky you have to be to ever have a stable job in that field nowadays, even if you're extremely talented, which I'm not.  **So I wasted a few years and am left with 100% unmarketable skills.**

I think half the reason I pursued that career in the first place is because I dread that daily question of ""So what do you do?"" to the point I get sick to my stomach.  I just wanted to live my life with something cool I could answer with, and what better than a field that combines technology with creativity, two things I've always been good with.  But now I'm to the point where I put off even getting a haircut, or cancel dentist appointments, anything I can to to avoid that god damn small talk question I get asked every time I leave my house.  I just never know what to say, aside from ""Nothing."" and it kills me.  **[[If anything, I'm hoping someone can atleast give me a little advice as to how to answer this question.  I know it sounds stupid, but it makes me feel like I've been punched in the stomach every someone asks.  And it's the first thing everyone always asks.]]**

I haven't had a social life in years.  **My last and best friend actually got me a job at a museum a few years ago, and we were going to carpool, but just before I was going to start, she was killed in a car accident.**  She'd planned to introduce me to all her friends there, but after that I just couldn't face meeting them with her gone, so I turned down the job.  I haven't really had a friend, or applied to a job since.

**I live in a disaster of a hoarder house, I don't even have my own room, I sleep on a couch now.**  My mom got a hoarding problem after she was given 2 years to live from cancer (which she made a full recovery from, though we still live in fear), and sold all her things and antique book collection only to regret it.  Now with my mom living with my grandparents (because of their failing health) and my dad always working and being a raging alcoholic when he's home, I'm trapped in this disaster of a house most people wouldn't even find livable.  I've spent the last few years just on my computer for almost every waking hour, trying to distract myself with movies, games and more recently books, in this crowded hoarder room so packed with stuff you can't even see the walls.  **I have anxiety fits when I'm trying to sleep, just over paranoia of my PC crashing one day (which i know is inevitable), and how much of a nightmare that would be to fix, as I'd have nothing left to do, and not even anywhere to sit aside from at the computer desk.**  Simply getting a single blue screen is enough to make me throw up with worry, and it takes a few days of no problems for me to relax again.

I've seen doctors, but they didn't help, at best.  **One increased my Zoloft prescription again and again, and finally told me to stop taking it entirely.**  I went through such bad withdrawal that I ended up in a hospital after a suicide attempt.  I see now he was a horrible doctor (and I've seen other bad doctors since then), and I don't even know where to begin looking for a good doctor, or even what kind of doctor to see.  A shrink, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a sleep specialist?  I lose my health insurance in 4 months anyway though, so I suppose it doesn't matter.  I've been so depressed for so long, I feel like it's a permanent part of my personality and my way of thinking.

I'm not suicidal, but I can't help but think it's inevitable I reach that point.  This can't last forever, and I don't see light at the end of the tunnel.  Though I am plagued with awful, suicidal dreams about twice a week, that just kill me.  I've started drinking excessively the last few months, and smoking pot the last few weeks just to be able to get to sleep before sunrise, which I can rarely manage even on 48-hours awake.  **I couldn't even get myself out of bed to get my mom a mother's day card**, who I'm very close to but only see once a week at best.  She's probably more stressed and depressed than I am, having to take care of her dying parents every day, and I think she's starting to crack.

I constantly worry myself sick over so many things, that I couldn't even begin to list here.  **Even if I could find a job right now, and had a way of transportation, I don't think I could handle even part time.  And at this point, I just can't see myself ever enjoying life enough to work hard at it.**  I have no one to turn to, and I just don't know what to do.  Doctors didn't work out for me whatsoever.  My life is going so by so fast, and I can hardly stomach the idea of growing old, not to mention wasting my entire youth.  I'm taking such bad care of my health now, and part of the reason is because I really don't want to live past 60.  I don't think I could handle it.  I'm not suicidal, don't get me wrong, but I feel like my parents are the only thing I have left, and I'm just waiting for a time when even they're gone so I can end it.  

Nearly every single day, something bad happens, and I have yet another worry added to the pile.  Failing health in the family, the house falling apart.  **Electrical and cable problems, but the house is such a mess technicians can't get to the walls.**  There's so much more I wanted to mention, but I could easily triple this post, so I'm gonna stop here...  I just don't know... how to even begin making things a little better... I'm lost, and I feel like the only person in the world this pathetic. =[

**tl;dr: I'm 24, no college education, never had a job or a girlfriend, don't know how to drive, live in a hoarder house with an alcoholic father, I have no bedroom and sleep on a couch, have no friends and nowhere to go, so I spent all my waking hours on my computer in a crowded hoarder room, trying to distract myself.  Doctors and medication made me worse, I'm about to lose my insurance anyway.  I'm plagued with suicidal dreams on the rare times I can sleep.  Developing an alcohol and marijuana habit.  Family members are dying, the house is falling apart, I have no future, no plan, no hopes.**

Edit: Feel free to ask me anything.  I don't expect any replies to help, but I actually enjoy answering questions."

I'm also open to general summer jobs; like at a gym, outlet store, or restaurant. Anything goes at this point, but manufacturing is first priority.

1elp9u,228,2013-05-18,Affirmations,Grakmarr,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1elp9u/affirmations/,"I became friends with Daniel, or Dan, in middle school. In the interest of full disclosure, Daniel was his middle name. His real first name, which he understandably hated, was Francis. Who the hell does that to their kid? Anyway, he had more working against him than just an unfortunate name. He was 5'5, 130 pounds soaking wet, wore glasses, stuttered, and was horribly awkward. I was no prize myself, six feet tall and fat as hell, man tits, second only to Dan in awkwardness. We had our share of common interests, but what really brought these two thirteen year old boys together was the realization that without each other we had no one. By staying close, we mitigated the amount of hell that could be directed toward either one of us individually. Instead of everyone ragging on me for being a landwhale or him for being a nerd, we split the attention between us. It was a mutually beneficial friendship, which lasted until shortly after we reached high school.

Before my freshman year, I joined the football team and started lifting weights. I was tired of the teasing, and willing to do whatever it took to be treated decently for a change. The end result was nothing miraculous, but between my subtle transformation and the respect of my new friends it was enough to keep me from being the target of mockery - some of the former bullies even seemed to want to make amends. My new life was going well for me, I just wish I could say the same was true for Dan.

Whereas I made changes to better my circumstances, everything seemed to be going downhill for him. He grew taller, which only made his already slim frame seem gaunt and sickly. His eyesight took a turn for the worse, and soon he was wearing thick rimmed glasses. His personal hygiene became somewhat... objectionable. I tried to remain casual friends with him out of respect for the help we had given each other over the years, but Dan became sullen and distant. Every once in a while he would call to congratulate me after our team won a game, and we would talk for a few minutes. But by and large, even perfunctory gestures like that were rare.


After high school, as it is wont to do, life happened. To wit: I got a shitty retail job, a shitty girlfriend, a shitty security job, an amazing girlfriend (fiancee, now), and a less shitty security job. I forgot all about the past, about school, about Daniel. Until a couple months ago.


I had been home from work for maybe an hour when my phone rang with a number I didn't recognize. Most folks would probably let something like that go to voicemail, but curiosity has always been a weakness of mine. When I answered, I was greeted by a confident baritone voice.


""[Grakmarr's real name]?""


I started to confirm, then asked to whom I was speaking. I don't owe money all over town or anything, but I'm reasonably sure there's a collection agency out there with my file buried in a stack somewhere.


The man on the line chuckled and answered, ""It's me, Daniel. From school.""


I replied cordially, and made all the typical long-time-no-talk greetings, but internally all I could do was wonder when that squeaky stutter of his turned into the used car salesman patter I was hearing on the line.


""I called because I was just thinking about old times,"" he continued, ""and how much of an ass I was to drift away from you like I did. I guess I was jealous that you found your place, while I was still struggling. I heard you're still in town. I was hoping we could grab some lunch and catch up. My treat.""


""Sure,"" I replied, ""Sounds great."" It didn't sound great at all; frankly I was happy to put those days behind me years ago - but again, curiosity. I had to know. We made the arrangements, and ended the call.


The next day I went to meet him for lunch at a local barbecue joint (there's one thing about the American southeast, you're never out of walking distance from a church or a pork sandwich) and started scanning the crowd for someone who looked like a decade-older version of my old friend, when a handsome stranger in a three-piece suit waved me over. As I walked toward him, the realization hit me.


""Holy shit... Daniel?""


He grinned, flashing perfectly white teeth. I made a mental note to smile with my mouth shut to hide the lifetime of nicotine and sugar damage, and plopped down in the seat across the table from him.


""Hey man,"" he said, ""You haven't changed a bit.""


I thought I caught a whiff of derision in the comment, but was willing to let it slide even if it wasn't my imagination. I *am* just an older version of what I was back then, and I was mistakenly expecting the same from him. Instead I got a young Johnny Depp in a cleaned and pressed suit that appeared to cost more than I make in a month. It's not that I expected someone nearing thirty to still have acne or anything, it's just that the characteristics by which I (and everyone else, I suppose) defined him had undergone such a radical transformation that he was wholly unrecognizable. Thick black-rimmed glasses had presumably been abandoned for contacts, lanky build now lithely coated with muscle evident even through the suit, and his quavering stutter a distant memory. It was my turn to stutter, now.


""So uh..."" I squinted, ""Wh-what's new?"" We shared the laugh of two people preparing to address the metaphorical elephant in the room. He told me everything; and enthralled, I let him go on at length. Evidently after high school he went on to earn his MBA, and became the VP of Global Sourcing (whatever that is) for a major local business. He was on the Board of Directors for a non-profit, and co-founded a scholarship program for gifted youths. When he was finally done catching me up on all of his numerous accomplishments, I asked the one question left unanswered: How?


""When I went away to college,"" he said through sips of his unsweetened tea, ""I learned about something called 'affirmations'. Basically you decide on a specific goal you want for yourself, and put it in writing multiple times throughout the course of the day."" He tapped a leather-bound notepad jutting just slightly out of his pants pocket while he spoke, ""You keep doing this every day until you've achieved your goal. It focuses your will, and doesn't let you lose sight of your objective until you've accomplished what you set out to do.""


I nodded, ""I've heard of that before, I've just never tried it. So it really worked for you?""


He grinned wider, ""It did. I think you have to really want it to, though. The more earnestly you do it, the more likely you are to succeed. Personally, it saved me. I was skeptical, it sounded really silly at first. Once I saw that it was working, I began to take it more seriously. What about you, anything new in your life?""


I told him about my boring job, and he listened politely. But when I started talking about my fiancee, his eyes lit up, and he seemed to be paying genuine attention.


""She sounds wonderful,"" he said, ""I'd love to meet her sometime.""


Now this woman is truly amazing, but she's the exact opposite of me in one regard: She is a complete social butterfly. She doesn't nag me about anything, except when it comes to my total lack of friends. And to my surprise, Daniel had turned out to be a seemingly awesome guy, so I excused myself from the table to see if she would be okay with having him over for dinner. She seemed delighted at the prospect, if a bit surprised, so I went back and made the offer to Dan.


""That would be excellent,"" he said, ""I'm looking forward to meeting the woman who could make your life so complete.""


Dan paid our bill and shook hands to part ways for the time being. As he extended his to mine, I couldn't help but notice the maze of shallow cuts along his palms and fingertips - but immediately shrugged it off. I tried to brace myself from drunkenly falling onto asphalt one time and ended up with something similar, so I know these things happen. But when he caught me studying his hands, he averted his gaze for the first time during our entire conversation, and quickly excused himself. Strange as that final exchange was, it was a pleasant nugget of schadenfreude to know that some of the old quirky kid was still left in him. We can never entirely outrun our past, after all.


I helped my fiancee with dinner as best I could, largely by staying out of her way, and got our little apartment ready for my old friend. Dan showed up right on time, clean-shaven and dressed almost as nicely as he was for lunch, and made the traditional platitudes about our humble home. I had no sooner mentioned my fiancee's whereabouts in the kitchen, when he made his way past me in a hurry to introduce himself. The two of them exchanged pleasantries, and we sat to eat.


We shared good food and good conversation, with no sign of the oddness Dan showed when we parted earlier, save for his occassional nervous petting of that same notebook  when my fiancee and I were addressing each other. I was beginning to wonder why he felt the need to bring it with him, but I supposed that's just what you do when you take a compulsion so seriously.


After dinner, my fiancee had slipped off for the night, and Daniel and I saw ourselves to the other room to have a chat and a few drinks. My hand tends to tip the whiskey bottle a bit heavier than the soda, so before long we were both more than a little inebriated. For me, this was any given Tuesday; but Dan seemed a bit less acclimated to the ways of the bottle, not to mention the six inches and god-knows-how-many-pound advantage I had on him. By the time the ice was melting on his third glass, he was stuttering like good ol' thirteen year old Francis again, and his conversation turned a little emotional. He started talking about his myriad failed attempts at romance. This was an unintended development on my part, but again: Schadenfreude. I'm not a perfect man, by any means.


""Remember the affirmations?"" He cocked his head toward me, green eyes squinted knowingly, left hand stroking his notebook, ""They do work. Just not for other people.""


""What do you mean,"" I asked, ""Other people can't use them to better themselves?""


He laughed bitterly and shook his head, ""No, anyone can do that. They don't work when you try to change other people.""


I furrowed my brow, figuring my old friend had imbibed far too much alcohol and was now intrepidly exploring gibberish territory, ""Well of course not. You can't just will someone to be different. People are who they are, there's no changing that.""


Dan jerked his head toward me, glaring, ""Everyone can change. Everyone *needs* to change. *You* changed. Someone *loves* you, now.""


There was venom punctuating his words, and little flecks of spittle as well. I really hate angry drunks, but he was my guest, so I tried my best to comfort him. ""Dan... I had to work at that too, buddy. That's not the kind of shit you just write down in some notebook and wait for it to happen. It takes patience, and an open heart. And yeah, sometimes you have to go through the wrong ones before you find the right one. I've ended up wounded plenty of times, but love is worth bleeding a little.""


He jerked up out of his chair at that, swaying back and forth slightly, stared me dead in the eyes and said, ""I've bled plenty. All I want is what you have, right here in your home. And I can't fucking make it happen.""


My mouth was trying to form words, but Dan was already headed toward my bathroom door. After it slammed shut behind him, I just sat in my chair staring at the floor. Poor guy really seemed to have issues, and I started feeling terrible for reveling in what faults of his remained.


When I finally looked up, I noticed that the notebook must have fallen from his pocket when he rose so suddenly. Curiosity engaged in a brief struggle with respect for the privacy of others, but ultimately won a decisive victory. I leaned out and snatched it up, and began to slowly leaf through the pages.


It started out much as I expected. The first dozen pages were neatly scripted in blue or black pen, repeating the same sort of sentences over and over again.

After some more of this sort, the writing became a bit shaky. The letters grew jagged and seemingly rushed, and the margins of the paper were increasingly ignored.

At this point I thought he had started using watercolors, the letters were thick and streaked with dark fingerprints.

I sat there, stunned, and became acutely aware of the bathroom and the occupant therein. I stood slowly, crept toward the threshold, and pressed my ear against the door. Silence.


""Dan?"" I whispered, ""You okay in there, buddy?"" Nothing.


I tried the knob, surprised to feel it turn in my hand. The door met resistance after opening less than a foot, and I hesitantly stuck my head in through the gap and looked around. Daniel lay there blocking the door, face down in a widening pool of his own blood, his hand extended toward the wall beside him. Choking back the pork tenderloin and whiskey threatening to make an oral exodus, I looked up to the wall - and read Daniel's final affirmation.


There was an investigation, of course. Dan was a very important man in the community, and I'm... not. But the suicide was about as cut and dry as they come; he even left a note, of sorts, on my wall. And the questions really died down after they examined his book. As far as the authorities and the media are concerned, the whole scandal is over. I wish I could say the same for me.


Often I'll dream about what I saw in the bathroom, and wake in the middle of the night. Sometimes when I have that dream, I'll try to sit up without waking my fiancee. When I do that, I swear I can see a scrawny little boy in glasses sneering at me from the corner of our bedroom; and I remember Daniel's final affirmation scrawled on that bloody wall.

I am a molecular bio major currently and was hoping that I could have some insight shed on my next few semesters. First off I should say that I intend on taking the MCAT and applying to medical school, being that it is a bit of a long shot I am also looking at BME or Bioinformatics in grad school if Med school doesnt pan out. I also got some poor grades in some intro classes that will need to be retaken to improve my gpa (the school will drop the initial grade and replace it with the grade after I repeat it to remove the poor grade from GPA calculations). That being said I will be through organic chem 1 and 2 over the summer and my fall semester is as follows:

* Genetics + Lab
 
* Cell Biology
 
* Introduction to Evolutionary Biology

* Human Systems Physiology + lab 

This totals 14 semester hours so far. I still need to take Physics 1 and 2 with their respective labs. 
I am considering restructuring this schedule to better prepare me for the MCAT in spring or after spring semester so I was thinking something more like:

* Physics 1 + lab
* Genetics + lab
* Cell Biology
* Intro to Evolutionary Biology
* Chem 1

This totals 17 hours so far and then in the spring take:

* Physics 2 + Lab 
* Zoology + Lab
* Molecular Biology + Lab
* Chem 2

This would total 15 hours and I would either take the MCAT in the spring semester or right after at the start of summer. After these courses would be completed I would still have to take Human Systems Physiology, Microbiology and lab, immunology, biochemistry, virology, and senior internship as well as one more repeat for GPA purposes. These last few courses would be spread over summer and fall or fall and spring of the 14-15 school year. I would start getting denied from med schools (just a joke, hopefully ill get in) after the spring semester of my junior year and should have enough time to also look at some grad schools in the area as a back up. Does this sound feasible or is there a better way I should be going about this? 

Thanks for your time

I've been playing for about 6 months total. The last 3 or 4 months I've been going to stick n puck and practicing/scrimmaging at 3 or 4 times a week, and even though I'm still pretty bad I've seen some serious improvement.

I'll be in Denver for an internship this summer, and I'm gonna keep going to stick n pucks/pickup games at least 3 or 4 times a week. If I practice my ass off, go to any clinics I can find, maybe throw in some extra lifting and conditioning, do you think I'd have any chance of making my school's team when they have tryouts? I go to University of Maryland; we aren't exactly making it to the Frozen Four anytime soon, but I'm sure most of the players have been playing since they were kids. 


""Tryouts are held the first week of September.  Tryouts are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night of that week.  There is a $100 tryout fee.  The team is selected on Thursday following the last tryout.  The D3 team has tryouts the following week (students who pay the D2 tryout fee do not need to pay again for the D3 tryout).  Students are encouraged to attend the D2 tryouts.  There are typically around 50 students each year at the D2 tryout.  The D2 team rosters 26 players: 3 goalies, 15 forwards, and 8 defensemen. ""


Do you think it'd be insulting to email one of the assistant coaches and ask if he thinks there's any hope? Maybe if there are certain drills they do at tryouts that I should definitely practice? I'm definitely not gonna be on the first line, but maybe a backup 4th line guy?"

She even broke up with her boyfriend after I had told her that I wasn't going to make a move on her until she was single. 80% of the time we spend together has, up until this point, been doing homework with her (the other 20% has been times we've hooked up and slept over at each other's apartments). Shortly after we met, she got an internship offer two hours away in the city and accepted. I didn't even consider continuing our relationship throughout the summer when she initially broke the news to me, but now that we've spent more time together, I don't know how I would cope with NOT being in a relationship with her, even if it is long distance.

She's told me many times that she's going to be extremely sad and unable to cope with the fact that we won't be able to hang out during the summer, and I told her I feel the same way. I don't like to admit I'm insecure, but I'm not sure if she'll continue to be this into me even after she's moved. Part of me thinks it's just the ""new"" feeling of this relationship that's keeping it going, and to add on to that insecurity, I think that the relationship has only worked out so well so far because up until this point, we've always had school work to work on together.

She's proposed the question of whether or not we should try the long distance thing and I was opposed to it but I can tell she really wants to try. So, should I try the long distance thing out? I should mention she's coming back in the fall, so my initial plan was to stay single in the summer (so that I didn't have to think of whether or not she was cheating on me) and hopefully get back with her in the fall, but the trust between us has grown to the point where I can trust her(at least I think I can). Or should I potentially lose her and hope for the best in the fall?
Any opinions are welcome, experienced or not. I really just want to talk to people about this to see what they would do.

TL;DR: Girl I'm in to is moving two hours away for the summer, we're really into each other and seriously considering long distance relationship, should I try the long distance thing out or hope for the best when she comes back next fall?

EDIT: I know two hours isn't that far but the point I was trying to make was that I'll only be able to see her every (other) weekend instead of every day."

Translated using google translator.

An internal battle has shaken Labour and Social Services. It began with a missing handshake and ended with a written warning and damages of 30,000 kronor.

A trainee, directed by People's University, offered an internship in the integration unit. He came to visit to see the work and health of the employees.

But the visit was not developed as expected. When the female supervisor would welcome health intern, he refused to take her in hand. He referred to their religious beliefs that forbid him to take women in hand without having to wash up afterwards.

The female supervisor then announced the intern that he, in order to work at the workplace, must be able to take all the people in place. Possibility of subsequent hand washing is, so it should not be a problem, she said.

The trainee could not accept the decision and the Equality Ombudsman was connected. But before a notification could be established paid Trollhättan city paid 30 000 in damages. The female supervisor was awarded a written warning for violating the Trollhättans urban diversity.

Administration Said Niklund never hesitated before measures.

- The applicant explained that his religion forbade him to foreign women in hand. Based on the correct position, a person adversely affected by their religion entitled to damages. We made a mistake and took responsibility and the person received compensation.

Said Niklund refers to Trollhättan urban Equality and Diversity Plan, which was introduced at the beginning of the year.

- Indirect discrimination may be perceived as neutral but disadvantageous groups in practice, if one condition, he says, and points out that the trainees were disadvantaged because of their religion.

- He would get the internship provided that he takes women in hand. This was conditional internship placement.

Unable situation is solved in a different way than the warning to the supervisor and a large compensation?

- We had a dialogue with the trainee to repair the damage, for example with another internship. But the damage was already done.

One who does not think the issue is that simple is Lennart Andersson, former chairman of the Municipal Trollhättan. The last case before retiring was the missing handshake.

- I've never seen anything like it, he says and continues.

- One must ask the question of who has been wronged. In this case, it was not just the man but also the woman.

From the union's side tried to get the employer to not hand out a warning. The hearing ended in disagreement but Lennart Andersson thinking on.

- There are many questions. What is required to be available for work? Can you refuse to do certain things, and if so what?

Henrik Larsson, MWU new chairman, explains that the warning to the female supervisor does not have to mean anything.

- The employer may distribute a written warning although we are protesting. The burden of proof is not great. However, if the employer wants to proceed with other steps, then weigh the burden heavier.

The problems of integration unit now becomes the subject of a safety investigation.

- It has been created such anxiety in the working group to the senior safety has been switched on, says Henrik Larsson.

Translated using google translator.

An internal battle has shaken Labour and Social Services. It began with a missing handshake and ended with a written warning and damages of 30,000 kronor.

A trainee, directed by People's University, offered an internship in the integration unit. He came to visit to see the work and health of the employees.

But the visit was not developed as expected. When the female supervisor would welcome health intern, he refused to take her in hand. He referred to their religious beliefs that forbid him to take women in hand without having to wash up afterwards.

The female supervisor then announced the intern that he, in order to work at the workplace, must be able to take all the people in place. Possibility of subsequent hand washing is, so it should not be a problem, she said.

The trainee could not accept the decision and the Equality Ombudsman was connected. But before a notification could be established paid Trollhättan city paid 30 000 in damages. The female supervisor was awarded a written warning for violating the Trollhättans urban diversity.

Administration Said Niklund never hesitated before measures.

- The applicant explained that his religion forbade him to foreign women in hand. Based on the correct position, a person adversely affected by their religion entitled to damages. We made a mistake and took responsibility and the person received compensation.

Said Niklund refers to Trollhättan urban Equality and Diversity Plan, which was introduced at the beginning of the year.

- Indirect discrimination may be perceived as neutral but disadvantageous groups in practice, if one condition, he says, and points out that the trainees were disadvantaged because of their religion.

- He would get the internship provided that he takes women in hand. This was conditional internship placement.

Unable situation is solved in a different way than the warning to the supervisor and a large compensation?

- We had a dialogue with the trainee to repair the damage, for example with another internship. But the damage was already done.

One who does not think the issue is that simple is Lennart Andersson, former chairman of the Municipal Trollhättan. The last case before retiring was the missing handshake.

- I've never seen anything like it, he says and continues.

- One must ask the question of who has been wronged. In this case, it was not just the man but also the woman.

From the union's side tried to get the employer to not hand out a warning. The hearing ended in disagreement but Lennart Andersson thinking on.

- There are many questions. What is required to be available for work? Can you refuse to do certain things, and if so what?

Henrik Larsson, MWU new chairman, explains that the warning to the female supervisor does not have to mean anything.

- The employer may distribute a written warning although we are protesting. The burden of proof is not great. However, if the employer wants to proceed with other steps, then weigh the burden heavier.

The problems of integration unit now becomes the subject of a safety investigation.

- It has been created such anxiety in the working group to the senior safety has been switched on, says Henrik Larsson."
1ekvw8,0,2013-05-18,My degree pooped the bed and I want to pursue a masters while I work... what to do for a better job chance?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ekvw8/my_degree_pooped_the_bed_and_i_want_to_pursue_a/,"I graduated in December with a BA in Political Science. I had  a high GPA, glowing internship, 10 years of management experience, and numerous volunteer work experiences. This meant exactly squat in the job market. I was lucky to land a job with an investing firm totally outside my desired field that paid decent 18/hr. However, the job is caustic and the environment is unethical at best. I started April 1st and they seem to love me there, but the job and the 100-mile daily commute is killing me. I just can't work there or even in that industry forever. 

Seemingly, despite my love of political science, the degree itself has shit the bed. It applies to very little and employers take it with a grain of salt at best. If I want to truly utilize it the only sure bet seems to be a move to DC. That isn't going to happen. 

I want to get a masters.  A few fellow graduates in my major have been themselves eyeing an MBA. I just don't know that an MBA will anyone  that much. I know that anything will help more than my current incontinent degree, but I have been leaning towards a master In Computer Information Systems with a focus on computer science. I would take it at a local state college. 

My question is will this degree make me more employable in a fashion that will allow me some more choices in employment. The last time I applied for roughly 300+ jobs and had exactly one offer in something that I didn't really want but had no alternative.  

I just want to make myself more employable so I can move out of this shifty high-pressure investment field. 


Any help you can give me in diapering my wayward BA would certainly help me to recover from the shitty situation I find myself in currently.

(Studying mech eng),[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1ekupd/what_skills_should_i_learn_this_summer_studying/,"I just finished my third year of college, studying mechanical engineering. Unfortunately, I remain unqualified for most summer internships since I am in a five year (3 + 2 year) program and have taken all the background courses such as maths/sciences, but no technical courses directly related to mechanical engineering.

So, at this point I have limited drafting knowledge and little applied thermo/mechanics knowledge.  I am considering using this summer to truly learn skills such as 3d drafting, programming, et-cetera.  I would consider this my ""job"" (studying and practicing 6-8 hrs a day) for the summer as opposed to working a retail/restaurant job.

I guess my real question is what skills I should set a goal to learn this summer in the case that I treat it as a job?  Is this even a good idea?

1eko38,7,2013-05-18,Every country should use monetary sovereignty to implement a Job Guarantee. CMV.,[deleted],changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eko38/every_country_should_use_monetary_sovereignty_to/,"As background in case you are unfamiliar with the policy proposal of the Job Guarantee, I refer you to the [Modern Money Primer by Randall Wray](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/p/modern-money-primer.html) and some of the writings of Bill Mitchell, e.g. [here](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=23719). They are some of the most consistent academic authors on the Job Guarantee.

The tl;dr version (unfortunately, still rather long) is:

* The JG ensures that there is essentially infinite demand for labor at a legally fixed wage that allows a decent living (the JG wage), simply by directly offering everybody who is willing and able to work a job paying that wage.

* JG therefore creates full employment and eliminates underemployment (in the sense that there is no involuntary unemployment - participation in the JG is of course voluntary).

* JG also establishes a de facto minimum wage (because everybody who earns less than the JG wage can switch to a job that pays this wage if they want to). Note that this happens without legislation: popular employers might still be able to pay less than the JG wage to junior employees and interns in hit-based sectors of the economy such as journalism and acting.

* JG provides a pool of better qualified potential employees for the regular job market than unemployment does (because workers in JG jobs retain and can even expand their skills).

* By setting the JG wage on the low end of what consitutes a livable wage, it does not compete with the private sector for workers. On the contrary, the private sector would grow by the additional demand created by the increased disposable income that JG workers have available.

* JG acts as an automatic stabiliser (when the economy heats up and wages rise, the pool of workers in the JG shrinks as they follow better offers into the private sector, and hence the outlays for the JG shrink as well; the reverse happens in a recession).

* JG acts as an anchor for inflation: Today, wage aspirations of workers are ""disciplined"" by the threat of becoming unemployed, hence the buffer of unemployment reduces the likelihood of an inflationary wage-price spiral. Unlike other proposals for achieving full employment, such as classical Keynesian stimulus programs, the JG maintains a buffer of JG employed, who also have no wage bargaining power, to dampen the wage-price spiral.

I vaguely assume that the JG will be decentrally organized but centrally financed. That is, while some JG jobs may be created by a central/federal government, the vast bulk of jobs will be created by regional/state and local governments or non-profit NGOs, perhaps also (with strict limitations) by private individuals and small businesses. The point is that there will be no limit to how many JG jobs can be offered, and they will be financed centrally, perhaps even directly by the central bank.

However, I do not care about the exact implementation details of the JG. What I care about is that it creates essentially infinite demand for labor at a reasonable wage.

Note that in the case of countries in the Euro area, countries would either have to leave the Euro or cooperate to establish a Job Guarantee for the entire Euro area, if central bank financing is to work.

**Why am I in favor of a Job Guarantee?**

Essentially, it comes down to the belief that (involuntary) unemployment and underemployment is a scourge of humanity for a number of reasons:

* It wastes human potential. We could enjoy more total output if we use everybody who wants to work.

* It destroys human potential. The long-term unemployed lose their skills; youth unemployment prevents skills from ever being developed. Hence, the seemingly short-term problem of unemployment thereby actually reduces the long-term growth potential of the economy.

* Unemployment, and even the threat of unemployment, limits individual freedom by threatening economic security.

* It has additional traumatic consequences for the individual: poverty, destroyed families, the psychological trauma of being told by society that you are unnecessary,children growing up without role models.

* It causes problems for society outside of the purely economic realm, in particular crime.

I am aware that some of these issues could be addressed by other policies aimed at reducing poverty, such as a Universal Basic Income. However, many of them can really only be addressed by eliminating involuntary unemployment. From all policy proposals I have seen so far, the Job Guarantee is the *only one* that can do this *permanently* and in an *institutionalized* form (meaning: it is not just a stop-gap measure, and it would most likely be rather stable politically once it has been successfully established).

**What would it take to Change My View?**

Logically speaking, you have to

1. convince me that involuntary unemployment and underemployment are good things or

2. convince me that the Job Guarantee cannot reach its goal of eliminating involuntary unemployment or

3. convince me that the Job Guarantee has negative side-effects that I would consider to be too devastating to justify relative to the positive effects of the JG or

4. offer a better policy to eliminate involuntary unemployment."

1ekj65,1,2013-05-18,Dilemma!! Should I turn down my Americorps position for a different gig?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ekj65/dilemma_should_i_turn_down_my_americorps_position/,"So I'm a new grad trying to figure out what to do. I'm lucky enough to be semi-employed for the summer, and I really do appreciate it.

My dilemma: I scored a summer Americorps spot (2 months) that requires all of my final application stuff to be in by Friday. Pros: I am super excited about the program I would be working on; there is a $1500 educational award at the end of the program; it's a fairly recognizable name to have on my resume. Cons: Pay is ~850/month since Americorps is volunteering with a living stipend; I would have to commute 1.5 hrs one way or work out multiple levels of subleasing so I would be close by.

Today, I got an email from someone in my school's career center suggesting that I apply for a summer internship in non-profit development (which is one of the areas I really see myself going into in the future- I mentioned this in my Americorps interview, in fact). I feel like I would have a strong chance of getting it since I have the skills for it and the internship is only available to students from our school. It also pays twice as much as Americorps (without the educational award). It also seems like it would be more helpful to have an internship doing exactly what I want to be doing in the future. The downside is that if my Americorps site doesn't have a replacement by Friday, they won't be able to have one at all. I really believe in their program and don't want them to be short-staffed because timing doesn't work out. 

Obviously, I don't have the other opportunity in hand yet, but I'm not sure what the best thing to do would be when the timetable is so cramped."

I'd like some advice on the following matter.
I've nearly completed my education (one year to go in a 5 year university course), and I like to think I did well overall. 
After my internship in a department of our university, one of the PhD's asked me if I was interested in obtaining a PhD degree there. I'm really interested to take on the challenge.

But I'd have to dissect rats and mice. Even if I hear about some techniques scientists use to kill or examine them, I think I'm about to faint. I never really did, but I had all the early signs: sweating, looking pale, feeling cold..
Is there any way you could get used to, or ""prepare"" for this kind of work? This dissection part would only make up a minority of my PhD work, but I really don't want to make a fool of myself in front of my collegues. And more important than that: I want to regain my self-confidence. 
I know I can do it, because I did a couple dissections a few years ago. I really don't know why I was able to do it without near-fainting in the past, but for some strange reason, it changed.

1ekiao,3,2013-05-18,In 3-4 weeks I (19f) am leaving the east coast for 9 months to work an internship on the west coast. I recently started casually dating a guy (22m) almost 2 months ago. He's distancing himself from me and I'm confused. Why is he acting this way?,dreamingangel52893,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ekiao/in_34_weeks_i_19f_am_leaving_the_east_coast_for_9/,"I started dating this guy close to 2 months ago. I told him right away that I was leaving soon and he told me that we should just enjoy our time together and take things casually. I wasn't specifically looking to date since I was leaving, but I figured something casual wouldn't hurt. We proceeded to see each other almost every day for weeks and needless to say, I started to get attached.

However, he's not the most emotionally open guy. Half the time I'm wondering if he views me as just a hook-up or if he legitimately likes me and would have wanted this to turn into a relationship. We talked a little while ago and we both agreed that if I wasn't leaving, this most likely would have turned into a relationship.

He's never been the best at replying to texts, but usually I get a text or a response some time during the day. There are very few days that go by where  don't I at least hear from him a little bit. But the past week or two I've noticed him becoming distant. I'm the only one who starts texts conversations anymore, I've gone from seeing him almost every day to maybe once a week and even then I have to practically beg him to hang out, and sometimes he doesn't reply to my texts at all. 

This is really starting to bug me. I can handle it if he's not interested anymore, but he's sending me mixed signals with what he's saying and what he's doing-- last time I saw him (about 6 days ago), he told me, ""Not that I don't want you to go to LA, because I totally support you pursuing your goals, but I really will miss you."" 

Let me tell you, this absolutely flabbergasted me. He NEVER says sweet/emotional things like that. Not saying that he's cold or mean or something, but he's just not the overly affectionate type. 

Furthermore, a few days ago I was in a potentially dangerous situation where I might have been in a car with someone who wanted to kill himself-- someone who previously dreamed about taking me with him. I talked to my guy about it he acted pretty protective and said things like, ""I can't have you getting stuck down there (Charlottesville) or in trouble when I can't come get you,"" ""I don't know what I'd do if something happened to you,"" and ""I just want you safe.""

So... again, pretty affectionate words. But his actions tell me he's totally not interested anymore. I know I'm leaving but I thought that if you liked someone, you'd want to spend as much time as possible with them before they go. This is just infuriating and I'm really hurt by this.

Also, I guess I should mention that previously he's expressed interest in picking things up again when I return. But we haven't talked about it in awhile so I'm not sure if he still feels that way.

TL;DR: I'm leaving in 3-4 weeks for a 9 month internship on the west coast, guy I've been seeing is getting increasingly distant and I'm really confused on what's going on. I don't know if he's not interested anymore or what. "

1ekbkb,7,2013-05-18,Objective Statement: yay or nay?,ReadyToEngineer,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1ekbkb/objective_statement_yay_or_nay/,"Alright /r/resumes, I am feeling troubled about ""Objective Statements"".

Right now I am going to work toward getting an Engineering Internship, I need this experience for both my personal and professional development, now, I decided to come to Reddit and I've found great advice, but I am a little troubled about 'Objective Statements', Reddit tells me:

* [Objectives are generally a waste of real estate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/faq#wiki_what_should_i_write_in_my_objective.3F)
* [Do not include an objective. It really doesn't mean anything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/kxn25/the_most_frequent_advice_i_give_about_resumes/)
* [I hire people. I hate objectives on resumes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/18ek10/rant_i_hire_people_i_hate_objectives_on_resumes/)
* [I don't like objectives. objective for a resume is to GET HIRED.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/10wpjl/i_help_hire_people_will_critique_resumes/c6htw8d)

So it seemed to be the common denominator here, so I decided to drop my ""Objective"" and instead converted in into a ""Personal Profile"" (as suggested [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/10wpjl/i_help_hire_people_will_critique_resumes/c6hdm7n)).

Now, I was pretty happy with my decision, I've started applying upon doing some work on my resume, while doing so I came to find that some of the companies have some ""Resume Tips"", where I found the following: 

* [Objective - to formulate a solid objective try to answer the following questions. What is it you really want to do? For whom? Where? At what level of responsibility?](http://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/content.do?id=16307) 

* [A career objective explains why your resume is in the reader's hands. It is a simple statement about your employment goals. It should immediately follow your name and contact information.](http://www.maximintegrated.com/company/careers/career-opportunities/resume-tips.cfm)

So this makes me feel like they are expecting an Objective Statement, I feel like my ""Personal Profile"" would cover that, but I am afraid that because they give this resume tips they are expecting an Objective Statement and from not getting it I'd be immediately disqualified and it also makes me wonder about what other companies could be expecting this as well.



**TL;DR** - **Had an objective, changed it for a 'Profile' upon browsing the Top posts on /r/resumes, then found out some employers encourage to add an objective.**

So /r/resumes,

* Do you think I should stick to my 'Profile' or go back to an 'Objective'?
* What's your opinion on objectives?
* For those of you that have gotten hired, did you have an 'Objective'?
* Hiring managers (if there are any around), What's your opinion?

1ek76r,9,2013-05-18,"""I matter!"" screamed the speck of dust",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1ek76r/i_matter_screamed_the_speck_of_dust/,"I'm not going to apologize for making you use your reading comprehension skills like the intelligent human beings they say inhabit the earth despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. So don't expect a tl;dr, since that was the bane of my fucking existence in the first place, and the lack of attention spans that go along with it. Since this is the last thing I might ever type, it's going to be good and long. And it's going to be the truth for once. 

I'm a writer. I was born one. I write, and I tear it all up to do it again because it never meets the standards I expect of myself. As far as I'm concerned, you can be a good writer or a successful writer, but never both. Good writing is antithetical to the tropes of fiction that play out interminably time and time again. It's constantly changing, growing, and it requires that people pay a-fucking-tention! If a couple million dumb shits wanna read the latest tripe banged out by Grisham, that's fine with me; it just proves I shouldn't have had anything to do with the human race to begin with. But it doesn't leave me with a whole helluva lot of options for making a living.

But let me start over. I am many things. Above all, I hate myself. I cannot even begin to explain the depth of loathing I reserve for myself; I am everything in a human being and more that should be shunned. I am cowardly, lying, lazy, prideful, jealous, greedy, avaricious, and above all I am filled with wrath. I am also fiercely independent and believe in the quality of life over its length. I am not an optimist, and am more a realist in that I am aware how little human life is worth while at the same time hating society to the core of my very soul for promoting systems in which it is so worthless. 

I am a fan of the Socratic view of ethics, in which the good of the many does not come at the expense of the few because the needs, feelings, and soul of the one is the very basis by which we can call ourselves human, and to try to rationalize that one person suffer for the betterment of many others is to allow evil into our minds and into society. Thus I hate law enforcement, government, the medical field, and will most definitely kill myself if I get so much as a whiff of an idea that someone is coming to commit me. If I'm feeling particularly angry, I'll be taking anyone who comes for me with me. 

God-fucking-dammit! Even my own cocksucking suicide note isn't coming out how I want it! 

It all amounts to finding the right narrator. I hate myself so much, that I can't even stand the sound of my own voice in my head. To begin to tell a story, I must find a quiet place and listen to the voices until one begins to speak. He (or she) tells the story, not me. It is like diving down into the depths of the collective subconscious, and if I'm very lucky I can bring back some of the wisdom we all carry deep within us. But much of the time all I have to show for it is the pain of losing those beautiful, morphean words just as easily as I found them. Like trying to hold onto smoke. And by talking about myself, I'm forcing myself to face up to a lot of lies that even I believe so that I can function from one day to the next. 

I am, at heart, a liar and a child. I want nothing more to return to that illusory, childlike moment when I could find comfort simply by running to my mother and confessing my fears to her. But, even as a child, I was troubled. I am a very intelligent man. Near eidetic memory, IQ of about 160, several degrees, and an extensive personal library. But for me knowledge is earned for its own sake. Learning something new is the point, not what you can do with that knowledge, as that leads to material bias and a perversion of pure science and pure scholarly work. I never could square myself with the notion of morally bankrupting myself for money as a boy, and as a man I never got the chance. For that I'm almost grateful, as opposed to all the drones on this planet who say they're just doing their jobs and in the process are contributing to the institutionalization of evil. 

I had a deep and abiding fear of Hell as a boy. Raised Catholic didn't help, though my mother was and still is sufficiently open-minded to be non-denominational spiritually. I suffered from crippling social anxiety before I could even walk. Being around people was and still is horrible, feeling as if I'm constantly being watched, judged, and mocked for not being able to keep up in some way. But at the same time I've been so very lonely throughout my life; I used to put on a brave face and soldier on, but the truth is that I've never had a friend I could be completely open with. I've never trusted a girl enough to get past the first date. I want so very much to have friends, family, and be loved, but I see myself as a social Frankenstein's monster. I can act human, but eventually I'm discovered for the freak I am, and I must run. 

I have some problems, physically. I was born big for my size, stand at over 6' 8"" now, and though I'm slightly overweight I'm a very imposing, scary looking person. I used to be complimented on it growing up, and used it to keep people away from me, since getting others to fear me meant they were no potential threat, but it was all an act. I've been trained to fight by Marine Corps personnel. I've been in a couple scrapes. I'm extremely proficient with firearms, but I've never done anyone harm because I know that if I attack someone I won't stop until they're dead; the human body is surprisingly easy to break, and there's so much poison locked up inside of me that I don't dare let a bit of it out or it will all come out in an explosion. Everyone I know thinks I've been stabbed, shot, been in serious street fights, and worked as a bouncer. They were all lies to make me feel better about myself and to explain all the self-inflicted scars and gunshot wounds. I have hurt myself terribly over the years, but the pain in my head from wanting to die and not being allowed always hurt worse. I could never drown it out.

I'm getting ahead of myself. Sorry. I have suffered from anxiety, panic attacks, and depression since I was born. I have nameless fears, and my dreams have been haunted by creatures seeking to torment me from beyond the grave for all my life. A part of me is tired of waiting and wants to go meet them in death so they can take me and have done with it, another part of me is still fearful, which has gone a long way toward keeping me from killing myself so far. I don't know if it's contributed, but my mercurial moods and frequent changes in temperament (sometimes as if someone is talking to a completely different person) may be due to an imbalance in my limbic system caused by a very minor deformity in my brain. I also have a slight speech impediment. I can only speak in a slur, or when I try to annunciate I sound like a robot. My choice of words is atypical, and it feels in my head as if there's a linkage between my brain and my mouth that's broken. I literally cannot voice my thoughts and feelings most of the time. 

This has led to a great deal of frustration in trying to get myself across to people, as well as a focus on written mediums, hence the writing thing. 

I spent most of my childhood alone because I was raised in a southern town and became known as the only kid there born north of the Mason-Dixon line. I tell myself that I got used to be alone, but in truth I still cry sometimes remembering what was said to me and how I was treated. I never did get used to being alone; I just learned that fewer people could hurt me that way. 

As if to fuck with my confidence even more, I became ill at the age of nine. My father was healthy every day of his life, so he didn't respond well. It was irritable bowel syndrome. I know, sure, lots of people go, ""Oh, I've got that,"" and think it's no big deal. No, you don't have IBS. I don't care what you think. If you don't spend 30-40 hours a week shitting blood like I have for the last 19 godforsaken years, you do not fucking have IBS. 

I bounced around from one specialist to the next. Had barium poured in every orifice, along with some very wide tubes. Turns out I'm resistant to most anesthesias, which I learned because I woke up with a colonoscopy scope shoved up my ass. The doctor actually cussed at me when I started screaming because he thought I wouldn't remember it after they dosed me again. Asshole. If you ever meet a guy named Joel Andres at Nemour's Children's Hospital, kick him in the dick for me and keep your kids well away. 

Some doctors said it was in my head. Some said I was faking it. Some said I was shit outta luck and just had to try to find some way to cope. I was a scared kid who just wanted to have some hope for his future; I just wanted to know it was going to be all okay, and all I got was the cold shoulder. I fucking hate doctors for that. They're the last person you should see if you're sick; no chance of getting help unless there's a drug they can push on you. And if it's a pain pill you need, you're better of just shooting yourself since in this puritan fucking country you're a damn dirty criminal for wanting the pain to stop, but that's a rant for later. 

My dad, it turns out, very likely poisoned me. He'd taken out a huge life insurance policy on me about a month before I began showing symptoms. Happened to my mother and brother too, whom Dad has also insured in the same fashion. Since he was a supervisor at one of the largest government-owned chemical facilities in the state, getting drugs would've been easy for him. But there's no way to prove it, and he fucked off and abandoned us when my mother became disabled while I was in high school, so there's no point in blaming him unless I go to shoot him before killing myself, which is not that likely since it's a long drive. Sadly, that's about the only reason I wouldn't kill him. 

I was homeschooled from that point on because I could not attend my classes. As an intelligent kid, my panic attacks and moments of hysterical crying increased. I knew full well that if I wasn't well enough to attend school, there was no way in hell I was going to hold down a job. And if you can't hold down a job, you're pretty much fucked. My parents, for reasons I will never understand, just kinda assumed I'd get over it. They were so very surprised when I got older and, guess what, I was still fucking sick!

So I managed to earn a couple scholarships. Paid most of the way for a 4-year university. I approached my professors, let them know the score, and they agreed to waive the attendance requirements provided I kept up with my tests and coursework. I went into psychology. Double-majored with English Lit. Figured I might be able to be a therapist since I'd spent so many years counseling my parents after their epic fights. Graduated salutatorian out of a class of 5,000 (I bombed a couple tests because I was going to shit myself if I stayed there any longer). I couldn't give a speech or walk because the graduation ceremony was expected to last 8 hours. I hadn't gone 8 hours without bleeding out of at least one orifice for more than 10 years at that point. No way could I sit in the middle of a football field while 50,000 people watched and I soiled myself. Not with my panic and anxiety issues. 

I was set to keep up my education (because it was putting off the fact that I couldn't work) and go into the school's master's program. But they changed the requirements. Mandatory internship at a mental health facility. I couldn't even attend lectures; no chance of managing this internship. So the school fucked me and kicked me out. I was forced to go back home. 

But my mother wasn't there. There was just some neurotic old hag in her place who kept whining about odd smells and bitching about the cats that she wouldn't let anyone else do anything about. I didn’t know her, but she kept acting like she knew me. With nowhere else to go, I moved in. 

The man she introduced as my stepfather was a slob. He disgusted me more than any slasher film I'd ever seen. At about 5' 4"" he was close to 200 pounds overweight, a severe diabetic, he never did anything around the house, and lived only for the sake of packing himself with potatoes, cheese, bacon, butter, and diet soda. I have lived with him for almost eight years now. And witnessing his rampant displays of gluttony has sworn me off most unhealthy foods there are. I haven't eaten in a month right now, and just the thought of that gross fuck hacking out a glob of phlegm from his fluid-soaked lungs and filling his toothless maw with an entire three pound box worth of instant mashed potatoes is enough to banish my appetite for another month. 

Right now he's forcing my mother to watch as he eats himself to death. I recently encouraged him to use his legs before the doctor took them; he didn't understand. And the twisted thing as I listen to him hacking and coughing because he's in the early stages of congestive heart failure while writing this is that it's not fair. If he's allowed to kill himself, I should be too.

If those were my only problems, I might be able to survive. But they aren't. You see, there's an Indian saying I heard once that goes something along the lines of, ""Just because a man is arrested doesn't mean his house won't burn down in the meantime.""

I was diagnosed with late-stage nut cancer shortly after coming home from college. I cannot tell you how elated I was thinking that I was gonna die. But they saved me, and while the doctor is joyfully giving me the good news across the desk in his office and my mother is crying into my shoulder next to me, I've got to smile and laugh, all the while inside I'm screaming bloody murder that my chance to go was taken from me. I was robbed.

And the after-effects, fucking Christ on high, the after effects are worse than cancer itself. And every sonovabitch gives me this shit-eating grin and tells me it's better than dying when I complain about it; if only they fucking knew. I've been diagnosed with an immune disorder similar to Lupus except without the wolf mask. It will rot my teeth out, eat the cartilage in all my joints, and kill me from renal failure in about 20 years. There's no cure. I've also been diagnosed with an eye disorder THAT HURTS! Every day for the last 5 unholy years, every single moment, I have been in pain. My eyes burn. They burn terribly, like someone poured onion juice directly into them. It has taken me that long, five, count 'em, five long years to convince an army of ophthalmologists that something is wrong. One finally came up with a diagnosis that fit. A diagnosis that about a hundred people on the planet have. It's only fixable with surgery. 

And the search for a willing eye surgeon was like the quest for the Holy Grail. 

Because, stop me if I'm crazy, I'd really rather not be conscious while an uncaring stranger sticks a fucking knife and tweezers into my eye. Somehow all these wretched mercenary fucks think it's no big deal. Guess what? Big-ass big deal!! Because there isn't a team of wild horses that's going to keep me from clocking the surgeon if he comes at me with a knife and I'm not drugged into the next dimension. It got so far that the first time one of them called me into his clinic for surgery, the first thing his nurse did was try to tie down my arms to the operating table. 

Well, strength born of panic and rage is not to be screwed with. I broke his damn table and stomped out, bellowing like a bull with its balls in a vice at the audacity of the sick bastard. He tried to have me booked for damage of personal property, I successfully had him booked for attempted kidnapping. 

So, finally the eye surgery has been scheduled and all the kinks ironed out. After 5 years of unrelenting pain, I don't know that I have enough of a mind left to be salvaged once the pain stops. My psychiatrist says I've likely developed PTSD because it's been the same as being physically tortured. All because there's no doctor who's willing to prescribe pain meds in the interim. I've got a damned excuse for having no balls, they don't. 

So, to sum up, I'm disabled, living with a fat bastard who's doing his best to eat himself to death and a graying hag that's steadily turning into a cat lady. I'm receiving SSI and doing my best to save it, but the increasing cost of living (plus the fact that no one has any money for retirement) means we'll likely all be homeless in a year or two. Everyone seems to think my writing will save them, but after writing about a hundred short stories, 9 novels, and collecting upwards of 10,000 rejection letters from every major publisher and literary agent in the English speaking world, it's apparent that I'm destined just to be pushed aside and left to die in the gutter. It's not that I want to die; I've just got no means to live. And if you dare mention self-publishing I will find you and gut you.

I wouldn't mind being able to make a clean break with that, maybe shooting my father, and then myself, but the problem is that my mother, step-father, and brother all seem to need me while at the same time being really tired of me being depressed. I know. I'm suicidally depressed and fantasize about death the way addicts fantasize about high quality heroin, and somehow it's my fault for making the people around me stressed. I'm such a selfish asshole, right? 

Seriously, I have decided that when my mother dies I will kill myself. I have planned to employ a nitrogen tank and an oxygen mask to kill myself via hypoxia. I'll sign all my assets over to my brother and help him sell off everything he can't take with him (our house will end up being repossessed because no one has the money for the mortgage). The problem is that there are nights (like right this instant) when the people I'm supposed to love remind me of just how fucked up everything is that I'm really, really, sorely, unbelievably tempted to kill myself and get it over with just to spite them. 

Since I'm not using a throwaway, and I don't care who knows as long as my real identity remains a secret, consider this my suicide note should I stop commenting or browsing Reddit.

""Exciting New Reality Show Seeks Talented Crew! (West Village)

Production Assistant @ meal, copy and credit""

Even though I know hard it is to get gigs when you're just starting out, I have to wonder, how legal is this? In one of the comments, the guy mentioned it was for Hot 97, the music station....and if they're putting on an entire reality show, I would imagine they have some funding somewhere...

I use that example, but there are plenty of them, and lately I've been wondering how legal it is for a company to advertise for these types of things. 

I've also seen ads advertising for G&amp;E worker ""Interns"". These positions tend to be highly specialized, and usually command about 300-400 a day (It varies depending on what type of shoot you're on, but that's what I've heard GE guys I know talking about). The example below is a feature film which clearly has SOME people paid to do their jobs, but is advertising for more unpaid labor. 

""Seeking Grip interns for ULB Feature! I realize this position is unpaid, but will get you in the door for Grip &amp; Electric! Dates are 5/23, 5/28, 5/29 and 6/5. Please send resumes to kerry@**********.com

-And then below in the comments she wrote the following.

I have received several resumes from individuals that have G&amp;E experience, but not quite enough to be hired yet. It is important that these individuals have basic knowledge of G&amp;E so that they do not create more work for the dept. in the end. Get it?""

Again I don't know this whole situation, but this is what really set me off to wondering: From the ad and the comments, this seems like a FEATURE film, with SOME people getting paid, and even though they don't neccesarily have the budget for the massive crew they want, they're advertising for people with experience to work for free. But she says clearly there is a department, and you can't run a feature film with a full GE crew on nothing. 

And again, if it was a short film or a passion project where everyone was working for free, I would get it. But these don't seem to be the case. 

Lest you think it's just these two scenarios, I see this ALL THE TIME. People  on corporate jobs advertise for interns to do regular PA, AC, Camera, and Electrical work (I can't tell you how many people respond because I tend not to respond to those ads). 

I had thought I read somewhere that 1) Interns can provide no immediate benefit to the company hiring them, and 2) They must either be paid or given college credit.

That is really not the case with most of these shoots. I didn't think there was anything wrong with it until a friend gave the explanation that if someone wanted a job at a bank, it would be illegal for the bank to have them work as a teller for free for three months just to ""gain experience"". 

So basically....am I completely wrong and just don't know anything about labor law? If you have a company, need a worker, and just don't want to pay them, how legal is it to just call them an intern and not pay them?

TL;DR: Basically, can feature films and corporate jobs hire unpaid, off the books interns as free labor? In positions where they NEED a professional but don't have the money? And is that illegal?

Edit: clarification on the TLDR."

As I unpacked my clothing and put them away, my parents made a couple of comments that nobody would take me seriously if I continued to wear argyle-patterned socks into the working world. Even though I've scored a summer paid internship and a rather exclusive fall internship, I'd rather play it safe and ask the community.

Have any of you been chided or taken less seriously for wearing matching argyle dress socks? I'm talking gray and blue dress socks while wearing a navy blue suit and yellow tie, and if I really want to go flashy, a gray and purple pair of socks while wearing a gray shirt and purple tie with a charcoal suit.

Is it acceptable to do this in the business/legal world, or do my parents have a point?"

1ek167,7,2013-05-17,What kind of (odd) jobs did you do to support yourself before you became financially stable in this industry?,Daisuke69,FilmIndustryLA,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/1ek167/what_kind_of_odd_jobs_did_you_do_to_support/,"  I graduated last year from UC Berkeley with a degree in film studies with a focus in screenwriting. However, I've spent the last year unsuccessfully trying to find a decent job that can help me pay my bills. I'm currently working as a writer for a start-up ad agency, but the pay is horrible, and I also don't get any benefits. I recently had to move back home in with my parents (about an hour and a half east of Hollywood) and the lack of income has really been putting a toll on me.  I'm also kind of limited to what jobs I can do as I suffer from a broken foot that never healed properly from when I was young, so I can't really have a job that requires me to stand for long hours.  I'm kind of at a lost at this point and my parents are really pressuring me to go back to school, get a ""real"" degree, and find a more stable career path. 
  
Unfortunately, even though I graduated from a top school, I don't think my film studies degree is helping much.  Therefore, I've been trying desperately to get an internship but almost all internships require you still be in college and are also unpaid.  In addition to that, I'd have to be commuting approximately 3-4 hours a day without pay. 
 
 I was just curious, what did you guys did to support yourself before you found a ""stable"" job in this industry and if you had any suggestions/advice into what I should look into (especially given my circumstance).  I know a lot of people do food service jobs but I was wondering if there's anything I can do that's related to my field that pays a little better.  "

We can afford part time or clerical support right now, but an internship might allow us to get someone who would be a better long-term fit.

I understand to do my own projects and put it online, but what I have done in class and what small little programs I make on my own aren't exactly comparing to the elaborate programs you look at on github or bitbucket.

And I have no work experience with programming, so would that just lead to a half empty page with the top section listing my school, GPA, and known languages, and my ""github"" link?

I know some of you must be in the same position now or have been in it and I am just asking for some direction. I do feel worthless, but I want to have some experience during college so my resume can actually look like a proper resume when I graduate.

[How many people have lost their shit in the tank? (freaked out, not crapped their pants\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t3us?context=5)|In terms of people losing their shit, it doesn't really happen. It seems like a crazy idea at first, but if feels really familiar once you're in there. It also puts your body into a super relaxed place, so it's a really hard environment to lose your shit in.  You can see crazy visuals and hallucinations in the float tank, but there's no point where you feel like you're not in control, so it differs from a drug trip in that way.  People are really forgetful after they float though, so our lost and found is pretty impressive :)
[How critical of a role has sensory deprivation tank technology played in keeping Portland, OR stuck in 1993?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tfaw?context=5)|Don't tell anyone, but float tanks are basically the flux capacitor in this equation.

A lot of those people have trouble quieting down that voice inside of their heads, and letting their body relax, and the float tank is amazing at helping you do that.
[How profitable is your business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0t5mf?context=5)|The business has been profitable from day one, pretty much.  We started with very little but it has been doing well.

It would be hard to do.  We check the tanks after each person.  If they did, it would mean we would have to reschedule on a bunch of people and cost us a lot.

[How is the water in the isolation tank cleaned? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ukfk?context=5)|The water is cleaned after each person with a cartridge filter.  Our pumps are powerful enough that the entire water in the tank goes through this filter system 3-4 times before anyone else gets in.  We also clean the water with hydrogen peroxide.  The fact that the water is so extremely salty does wonders to keep it clean.
[That's fascinating. I'm really pumped to use a tank for the first time soon.   *Most of our cleaning is dealing with the salt getting everywhere.*  I have a petty question about that. I do a lot of kickboxing and I play soccer regularly. On top of that I own a very strange cat. How worried should I be about getting in the tank with (little\) open wounds?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0uwxk?context=5)|If you are kick boxing your pain tolerance should be good enough to deal with a bit of salt stinging.  With that said we provide Vaseline to cover cuts, and the salt really helps heal said cuts up really fast if you man or woman up, hop in without covering the cuts up and let the salt do some work.
[*According to the team, it helped immensely.*  There's nothing like a good science experiment.  And that's nothing like a good science experiment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca11po1?context=5)|Look up studies on REST (Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy). That is the name that a lot of clinical studies on float tanks have been done. None of the studies had super large samples sizes, but they're still really interesting to look at.
[Anyone fall asleep in the tank? how do you keep them from drowning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wrwd?context=5)|The difference between sleep and deep meditation can be a fine line.  It is very difficult to submerge oneself because of the salt.  Also as soon as you get any near your eye, nose or mouth, you will be very aware and need to get out of the tank.
[What's the longest float you know of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vap2?context=5)|We have had someone come in and float 24 hours straight, and there are rumors that John Lilly did a 2 week float using an IV way back in the day, but for sure a 24 hour float has happened at Float On.  The Float Tank was first created in 1954 and the first commercial tank was released in the early 70's.
[How do you regulate the temperature in the water/pod?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vap2?context=5)|Different tanks use different methods, but the most common method is a set of water bed heaters under the liner.
[How did they feel after 24 hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vlij?context=5)|He said time was very silky, and had used the time to recover from a very long walk, which worked quite well.  Words and language take a bit of a backseat after that long in a tank, so not so sadly he was not a sound byte machine when emerging from a day in the tank.
[Are they impractical to have personal tanks at home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0vlij?context=5)|You need to be really committed to have a tank in your house, for a few reasons.  Cost, space, how close to a shower you can get it, salt is going to destroy things, and you need to float a lot before you are going to save money over visiting a center and letting them deal with the rest of it.
[One more question. Excluding rent since that varies, how much would you advise a new float business to have on hand before attempting to open a float center? Say in a popular but underserved city. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0w2f7?context=5)|That is going to depend hugely on how many people are on your payroll and how many tanks you want to have.  We shoestringed and bootstrapped to make this one happen.
[Where can I find cool shades to coordinate with my outfits, Float On guys? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tf37?context=5)|At our shop!  Come to Portland! 
[Is there a prize system? Like, save five shades and trade them for a mustache ride? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0th76?context=5)|You can definitely earn a mustache ride, but it involves a very hairy punch card.
[Have you read The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown?  Did the bit about the bad guy spending time in the sensory deprivation tank bug you as much as it did me?  Do you think Dan Brown is perhaps America's worst author?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0u49b?context=5)|Yes, yes, and yes.
[How does the experience relate to a DMT trip? Is there any ""mind fuck"" ?  I feel like going in a flotation tank would be claustrophobic and kind of scary. Is it as scary as it sounds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0v52k?context=5)|The tank is only as scary as the voice inside your head... So for me not so scary, for you...who knows.  In all honesty though claustrophobia is typically more about control than it is about space, and you are in total control of the whole thing.
[So can you open it up whenever you want?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca1gbc2?context=5)|Absolutely.  No locks or no latches on the tanks.  You are in complete control.  Of course, there is a client controlled lock on the main door to the float room... we want clients to feel comfortable (being naked and what not).
 |That's right. You just push the door and it opens. No locks or latches.
[How much does it cost to build and maintain a single tank? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0udj6?context=5)|It will probably cost you somewhere in the 2k-5k range to build your own float tank (with a decent amount of planning and handiwork).
 |The salt you'll need to fill it for the first time will be about $500. After that, they don't cost a lot to maintain. If it's just you and a couple other people floating, all you really need is about 50 pounds of salt a month, a few pool chemicals, and a tiny bit of electricity cost from running the heaters and the pump.
[As someone who wants to have his own float tank one day, which route/option would you suggest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0x13p?context=5)|Have you floated before?  I would start there, if you haven't.
[How feasible do you think it is to build on my own? I'd definitely consider it due to the cost but my biggest concern would be about making sure that the quality is up to par. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xhuz?context=5)|You are basically making a box with a heating element.  Everything beyond that is up to you.  The cheapest tanks are usually wood with a pond liner and some water bed heaters.  Fiberglass is another common option.
[Has anyone requested music? Sure, this defeats one element of its purposes, but having something made for a meditative state like Filosofem piped in during a float sounds awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0u7q6?context=5)|People can bring music in if they like.  We strongly suggest that people try a float in silence first, just to get a sense of it.  
[How does that work?  Can you bring an ipod and have it plugged in?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca176l5?context=5)|Exactamundo.
[Has anybody ever pooped in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tkyp?context=5)|Nope!  Thank goodness!  We check the tanks after each person.  Also a filtration system cleans the water after each person.
[What would you do if somebody did poop in it?   How would you decide who gets the privilege of cleaning it up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca19fah?context=5)|I was going to say that sounds like an intern task but I would actually make the owners do cowboy-ninja-bear to determine that one.  I'd imagine that the cleanup would depend on the nature of the feces.  We would probably have to throw out all the precious precious water.  :(
 |The water is filtered after each person so if they don't wash their butt enough your tank is still clean.
[How do you feel about people wanting to experience different types of drugs in your facility?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tgsr?context=5)|Wanting to do drugs is absolutely fine! Unfortunately, federal law frowns on actually doing them, and we have to take the same stance...
 |Legal drugs, like marijuana (with a medical card in Oregon) can be great for relaxing into the float, but a lot of people, after trying it, actually prefer doing the tank a la carte.
[Could you actually replace your bed with one of these tanks?  I guess it would help you a lot, but... will it be safe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xpnp?context=5)|There is one person I know of that did this for an extend period of time, but she was already quite experienced with the tank, and living a crazy exhausting life style, I think it is possible, but not for too many people.  
[What are possible drawbacks you're thinking of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ygoi?context=5)|Since the float tank promotes such a meditative state, it can be hard to actually slip into REM, which of course your body needs.
 |If you float every night for long periods of time, eventually your body will be able to easily slip into REM in there.
 |I've heard of one woman who slept in her tank every night, and then had trouble sleeping when she traveled because no bed was as comfortable as being in a float tank.
[What are your thoughts on the use of the sensory deprivation chamber on Fringe? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yabi?context=5)|I've only seen a youtube clip, but it's a lot less spooky than that. For one thing, we don't lock you in.
[You guys need to get an Olympic sized float tank.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0y2jl?context=5)|Do I hear a kickstarter in the making?
[What do you think of the Simpsons episode where homer went in one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yodi?context=5)|Fantastic! I remember watching that episode before ever knowing about float tanks, so I guess even in my own life, the Simpsons did it first.
 |They're a lot bigger than pictured in that episode, and we only put 1/4 of our customers on the back of moving trucks.
[I have to ask - how often do people have sex in these tubs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tiig?context=5)|That would be a salty and chaffing experience.  We only run solo floats.
[Is there such a thing as double (or group\) float?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tpzg?context=5)|We don't do those at our center.  They do exist.  It's different than floating by yourself.  I find it a little distracting but to each their own!
[I want to start a float tank business in my town. It's a town of 300,000. Can I ask you questions in private? I have no idea what I'm doing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wwcz?context=5)|Feel free to PM us.  Also check out [floattanksolutions.com](http://www.floattanksolutions.com/)  Best of luck to you!
[What's the best way to find one near me? Is there some sort of directory of these places internationally? I live in Germany so am not really sure what the terminology would be in German.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0x1nl?context=5)|[Link to www.floatation.com](http://www.floatation.com/wheretofloat.html)

[How do people react when their float ends and they are ""woken up""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yrdi?context=5)|Most people are really surprised that an hour and a half actually went by. Pretty much everyone feels super relaxed, and would hop right back in if we let them :)
[Oh, well. No one saying stuff like ""I was relaxing; you woke me up. *I hate you!*""? :D.  How do you wake people up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0ywyn?context=5)|We fade music into the tank. Each tank has transducer speakers that are below the water line, so it's actually a pretty neat experience to have sensory stimulation eased in like that after suck a long time without.
[How sound absorbent are the tanks compared to anechoic chambers ? I remember reading that most people couldn't bear to be in them for more than a few minutes and would think that with the deprivation of the other senses it should be even more uncomfortable. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wzjj?context=5)|The tanks are no -7 decibels but they are very quiet, a lot of the sound reduction comes from how you build the room, and we also have our tanks on sound isolators that keep the vibrations that come from the floor out.
[What are the age limits in the tanks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0w8sv?context=5)|There really are no age limits.
 |When it comes down to it, you're just floating in water and Epsom Salt.
[Yeah, i live up in Vancouver and I've heard a bunch about these tanks but I wasnt sure how old you need to be. Whats the youngest person thats floated at your location?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0wg2r?context=5)|At least 8 but I think his mom was in the room with him.  A 12 year old was floating on a semi regular basis a while back.
[I have OCD related to being dosed with LSD...absurd I know. Would the experience in the tank be something I could handle?  Ie no wild psychedelic experiences?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xg15?context=5)|You might have an experience but it is more mild than wild.  You are also very in control, being able to get in and out at your own pace and take a break any time you like.
[How intense are the visuals?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xvv7?context=5)|Anywhere from no visuals at all, too Flying across the universe, to being a crow on a lake.
[Oh man, I've always wanted to try a sensory deprivation tank. Until I went to your website I thought ""I wonder if there are any in Portland"". Well now I know!  So my question; who is your favorite lawmaker to work with? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0x1k0?context=5)|We have yet to deal too directly with any specific lawmaker, but I am a fan of a few specific politicians totally seperately from Float On. Elizabeth Warren, Dennis Kucinich, Ron Widen and Alan Grayson would be awesome to work with towards making opening float centers easier.
[Open one on the east coast? How much do you think that would cost?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0xl9l?context=5)|Depends a lot on the city, Manhattan versus some suburb of Atlanta are going to be two very different beasts.  With that said what tank style you choose, whether they are new or used, and how much work you do yourself versus hiring people are also going to be huge deciding factors regardless of where you end up opening.
[Cool. I wonder if their is anything nearby NYC.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0y2gt?context=5)|There are definitely a couple small places in NYC. Google that shit!
[I love the idea of sensory deprivation tanks but many of my friends think they would be too claustrophobic to even give it a try. Is claustrophobia a big concern of first time customers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0we1t?context=5)|It's something that everyone is concerned about being a problem that doesn't actually turn out to be a problem.  The main thing is knowing that you can get in and out.  Are they claustrophobic when they sit in a car or when they take a shower?
[Could someone bring goggles in and swim around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yqrj?context=5)|I routinely do laps in there as my morning exercise. With only 8 feet of length, you can get a couple thousand in before breakfast.
 |You have to be careful around the lifeguard though, he has a strict ""no splashing"" policy.
[As a supplier of sensory isolation tanks, do you know if there is still much scientific interest and activity in the consciousness experiments of Dr John C Lilly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0z2cs?context=5)|Interest - I think so. Activity - not as much, it seems. Are you thinking of something specifically? John Lilly did a lot of crazy stuff...
[I'm surprised I haven't heard of you guys before this, and I live in Tigard. Do you guys not run advertisements? And I am definitely going to stop by sometime in the near future because the experience sounds sublime.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0z4ne?context=5)|We don't do any paid advertising, but we run lots of fun projects that usually gets the word around. We've been on the news a couple times too :)
 |You should definitely swing by and visit us. We tend to book out a 1-2 weeks in advance, so give us a call before you come.
[How bad does the water taste with all the salt? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca13vty?context=5)|It's pretty intense.  It's magnesium sulfate (no sodium), so it doesn't really taste salty.
[Is it true if your placed in a sensory deprivation tank where you can't even hear yourself talk outside, that eventually you go crazy and want to commit suicide?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0yjw3?context=5)|Not that I know of, but I guess anything's possible.
 |There are some old myths about sensory deprivation and torture, but they're mostly fabricated.
 |The original studies on sensory deprivation involved people being put into dark rooms and told to lie on beds with cardboard and cotton all around them for incredibly long periods of time. It seems like most of people's anxiety and discomfort came from the laboratory settings and the fact that you're lying wrapped in cardboard for 24 hours.
 |The salt water we use nowadays is basically the most comfortable thing we've been able to come up with as humans. Once we invent anti-gravity machines, we might switch to that.
 |We now have people float for incredibly long periods of time who have amazing experiences. The record at our shop is a 24 hour float. The dude came out and said he thinks he can go for 48.
[What do they do about food/ water? Seems like you might get hungry or thirsty after a long period of time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0zm3k?context=5)|We advise people to eat 30-90 minutes before coming in, so you both don't have to listen to yourself digest, and are not getting hungry mid float.  For longer floats your body is in such a state of rest you just don't need the same amount of calories as you normally would.
[How tall and wide are the tanks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca2fa4y?context=5)|The tanks range form about 4-8 feet wide, and also 4-8 feet tall.
[Doesn't bouncing into the side of the tank cause sensation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca2fa4y?context=5)|You bounce a little at first, but if you don't push off the walls, you get centered pretty quickly, and then you're good.
[I am quite late, but do you float against the side of the tank? Doesn't it interrupt the relaxation? I want to do this so much!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca14oso?context=5)|You end up getting centered pretty quickly, and then not really hitting the sides.
[I've been interested in these Tanks for a while now. I know it relaxes you but is their any other long term effects at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca17nfs?context=5)|Absolutely. Basically curbing the effects of stress on your body consistently has incredible long term improvements. Look up research on REST (Restricted Environment Stimulation Therapy).
[Are there any at-home substitutes for those of us who aren't near a floatation center?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca10gax?context=5)|It can be hard to replicate at home, but basically just try to cut out as much sensory input as you can: dark room, no noise, a really comfortable bed, etc.
[How about doing a GroupOn for $10 USD for one hour, but that hour must be between 2 and 8 am? That way you can get lots of potential new customers, without antagonizing your user base.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca1yjyp?context=5)|We already float people between 2 and 8 am :)
 |That's a good idea though. I like the idea of happy hour floats.
[I'll be stopping in the next time I head up to Portland. Want me to bring you guys anything from the Rogue Valley?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca16vfb?context=5)|Heck yeah!  Bring yourself in for a float.
[Really want to try this. So cool.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0trun?context=5)|Come on over to Portland! Best known for float tanks, beer, and strip clubs.
 |Of course, there are also many other little float centers located around the US where you can experience the sweet awesomeness that is floating.
[My wife goes to this place occassionally and finds it to be a very positive experience. She considers herself midly claustrophobic. One of the tanks is apparently more of an open room, but it is dark. She likes that a lot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tws8?context=5)|That's great! We get a lot of people worried about claustrophobia before they hop in the tank, but then almost no one who actually has a problem with it once they're in there. You can open the door to the tank at any time, so you're really in total control of everything. The pregnant ladies love to float. There's actually a certain position in there that takes all the weight of the the mother's stomach off of her body. We even had one woman say she really got to know her child for the first time in the tank...woah...
[Also, when she was deep into pregnancy and was uncomfortably huge, floating was a great relief.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tws8?context=5)|

[Do you have any Naruto posters hanging up in your building?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tada?context=5)|None...yet.
[Please make an announcement when said Naruto posters are prominently displayed within the building.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca0tfzy?context=5)|You will know because we will change our business name to Naruto Posters On.
[Pretty much what I've heard about these is from Joe Rogan who says he smokes pot and goes in. I am completely against drugs, would there be a benefit for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ejeog/we_are_the_largest_sensory_deprivation_tank/ca1bsjw?context=5)|A lot of people associate the tanks with drugs because of Joe Rogan and John Lilly (the guy who invented the tanks).

Under this major the 4 concentrations my school offers is Accounting, Finance, Marketing, and MIS. I have taken classes in all concentrations, however have not had the opportunity to secure an internship in any fields. 

So I'd like to ask you the following: 

* How rewarding is a career in marketing?
* Do you enjoy what you do, and what specifically do you enjoy about it. 
* What does your typical work day consist of? And how often are you working outside of normal work hours?
* How long/what does it take to reach a high salary in marketing, and what might that salary be?
* What steps would you tell yourself in your sophomore year of college to take in order to boost your career?

Please feel free to answer as many or as few of the questions, and please leave any other advice you may have. Thank you in advance!"

I am a recent college grad (2 weeks ago! Whoo!) that has moved back home to Tulsa to attend the OSU-Tulsa campus for graduate school. 

These student loans aren't going to pay themselves back, so I am looking for a full/part time position, preferably in the metro Tulsa area. I've been using the traditional newspaper and craigslist routes, but i figured it wouldn't hurt to reddit network a little bit!

I have substantial experience in receptionist/clerical work, having done both for the past two years in work study positions at my university. I'd love to do more work in this area but I am open to other opportunities in any other areas you might be aware of.

I'm courteous, professional, and extremely technology proficient. I did well in school (graduated magna cum laude) and have done both retail sales and non-profit internships to round out my professional background. 

I can offer receptionist work, data entry, knowledge of Microsoft Office Suite, filing, multi-line phone use, and any other kind of office work that might be needed. If it's not something I know how to do already, I will be eager to learn. 

I'd be happy to supply you with my resume upon request. If you know of any opportunities I could look into, I would be very appreciative.

Have a great day!"

1enmsw,7,2013-05-19,I'm not sure if...,throwaway23446756,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1enmsw/im_not_sure_if/,"I'm 20 years old. For the last 6-7 years of my life, I can easily say that I considered suicide to be an option. An easy way out if things get too tough. As an atheist, the idea of my consciousness ceasing to exist is pretty appealing whenever I'm going through hardships in life. 

I've actually had a pretty good life so far. My parents are not too wealthy but they make a decent living... decent enough to send me abroad to US for college. My social life has never been better but it still isn't amazing. Never had a girlfriend. I always had mild-to-moderate social anxiety and still do, but I manage to be more social now. I've had girls wanting to get into a relationship but never the girls that I'm interested in or found attractive. I have a good internship waiting for me right now. I'll start in a month and live in San Francisco, making a decent amount of money.

I never had a good relationship with my father. We just can't get along. He can't get along with anyone. He can't get along with with my mother or with his sister or with his parents. My parents have a dysfunctional marriage and I've been told by both of them separately that the only reason they are together is me. I'm the only kid in the family and growing up, I would hear them fight and yell at each other every three months or so. After having some stronger fights with my dad, he told me that he will get divorced from my mom after my college education is over. He said this in the spur of the moment, no decision or anything but he says he won't support me or my mother after my graduation. This wouldn't be that easy, of course. Legal obstacles, family pressure etc. My mom also says the same thing... that she's still with my dad because he pays my tuition. He is not abusive or anything. He is just a negligent and rude asshole. Strangely enough, my mom's family is moderately wealthy too so we can afford the tuition either way but she would have to ask my grandma.

So far, not too bad, right. Well, everything is getting harder now. I'll graduate in two years and many problems recently emerged. My mom has a kidney disease called nephrotic syndrome. That's why she has been especially down and depressed lately. My dad is supportive but he's still an inconsiderate asshole. I've reason to believe that he cheated on my mom when I was younger. My mom on the other hand sincerely loves me and is a great human being. She gets angry easily and says things in the spur of the moment but I have no doubt that she has immaculate intentions all the time and I love her.

I've always been very close with my mother. As a kid, I would tell her that I loved her like every two minutes. As an anti-social kid, I spent a lot of my time at home and this brought us even closer I guess. Obviously my leaving for college was very hard on her. That's why we got a dog before I left. They get along very well and they are very dependent on each other. Two days ago, my mom had chest pains so I drove her to the hospital. As the avid smoker she is, we knew she was at risk. It's not cancer but she developed pneumothorax and had to spend the night at the hospital. I called my dad so that he comes to the hospital and spends time with her and he said he was on his way but he came in after four hours. I called him two hours in and he said he was somewhere on this way. My aunt called him and he said he was on his way but at an entirely different location, which is unacceptable. My mom had a nervous breakdown at the hospital bed because of this and stress of everything combined. They both spent the night there and I went back home. However my dad insisted on going to work the next day. We had a huge fight and I got him to spend the next day there too. He is there with her even right now. Other members of my family (grandparents, my aunt, her cousin etc) are also visiting and supporting her. She is going through a lot of pain and trying to endure it as she has some operations to drain the liquid from her lungs etc. My dad is still there, trying to be supportive but also still being an asshole even though it is to a lesser extent.

I've been taking care of our dog which I love and cherish. She misses my mom and it breaks my heart. I try to be supportive and play with her all the time but I'm not mom -- I can't do a lot of the things she can do. Today my cousin came over and he dropped one of his ""workout supplement"" pills. It is just amino acids and it shouldn't be a huge danger but it got me very worried. As a psychopharmacology-enthusiast (aka informed occasional drug abuser, will get to that later) I looked up all the amino-acids and found out that the risk profile is low. It is unlikely that she'll get any harm from it but she'll get some effects like stimulation followed by sleepiness. Even though I shouldn't be greatly worried, she took a lot for her body mass. I took her out for a run and she was very stimulated and agitated. I had to hold her back using the leash and even though I didn't hurt her or anything, it broke my heart doing that. I hate being assertive with her. It feels like I'm breaking her heart. She is so happy and full of life, smiling. It was very hard to bring her back into the house because she wasn't cooperative and this entire situation demoralized me even further. My mom will probably be in the hospital for at least 4-5 more days and I hope she gets better, and that my dog is totally fine tomorrow morning. But even the best case scenario happening, I don't see myself having an happy/ideal/comfortable future ahead of me and ceasing to exist looks like a great option. I feel lonely.

I don't know if my mental psyche has a text-book definition but I don't think I'm depressed. I'm prescribed ADHD medication and I can feel better if I decide to take them now but it doesn't feel like real happiness. It's just synthetic euphoria. I usually just use them to study or socialize. Throughout the last year, I smoked weed once daily before going to bed and it helps me immensely but I don't have access to it right now. I also experimented with psychedelics, hoping that they would make me a better person, let me discover myself, solve my inner-problems but they didn't help either. Even when high on cannabis, I still feel an emptiness inside me. I'm missing some integral part of what I want out of life. I need to change, I need to change something.

I've thought about just running away. Just getting a good amount of money, assuming a false identity and traveling across the globe... however far that money takes me. But the problem there is with that is that I'll be alive and I'll think about how sad my parents (especially mom, I don't care that much about my dad) are because I did what I did. They'll feel the same way if I kill myself but at least I won't exist to see it. I don't even know how I would kill myself. I would have to guarantee it. I would probably buy a lot of heroin, use for a long time until my tolerance is too high. Overdose and jump off of a bridge or something.

I feel empty. I feel like my future is in danger. I feel like I'll never truly be happy. If my parents stop supporting me, or if I don't have a job when I graduate, I'll have to go back to my country and I don't want to. But also not going back means my mom will miss me even more and she might need me both emotionally and physically.

I realize this is a huge wall of text but thanks for reading. For others... TL;DR: I'm thinking of ending my life.

1enmc8,3,2013-05-19,Aetna's medical history form and pre-existing conditions. Please help!,Jazzerciser24,Insurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1enmc8/aetnas_medical_history_form_and_preexisting/,"I just received a medical history form for my Aetna PPO for a doctor's visit a month ago. They say they need to know ""the name, address and phone number of any doctors"" who treated me during the six months before my insurance kicked in.

So, my question is, what type of medical visits am I required to tell them about? Here's a list of the visits I had during that time period:

Naturopath: physical examination (""doctor""?) 
Acupuncture: once a week for a few months for my irregular periods (not with a ""doctor"") 
Counseling: with an MA intern (not with a ""doctor"")
Elective surgery (followups only--procedure was over a year ago) 
Eye doctor: for eye test and glasses prescription (I think Aetna covers vision, but I'm not sure if I need to mention it.)

I am hesitant to mention the acupuncture visits because I am having some issues with acne lately, and I might see an endocrinologist about it. I am afraid the irregular period will make it a pre-existing condition, especially if it turns out I have something more serious like PCOS. Also, because my acupuncturist technically isn't a doctor, is it even necessary?

Also, are they allowed to look at my past applications for health insurance? I tried to buy my own insurance before I got my current job, and I was denied. I'm worried they can just look at that, where I mentioned the acupuncture and counseling, as well as my whole five-year medical history.

Thanks for reading and for any insight you can give me!"
1enl0g,2,2013-05-19,Intern needing advice on an office transfer,drthrowawayexpense,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1enl0g/intern_needing_advice_on_an_office_transfer/,"I'm interning at a big 4 this summer (medium sized office), but I would like to start at another location full-time (large city office).

**Do I wait until after I secure an offer to ask, or should I bring it up sooner?**

The recruiter had previously mentioned they would accommodate people who would like to intern near school, but start near home, however, I don't fit into that category and I had not been interested in starting somewhere else at that time.

I read another thread and the top post mentioned bringing it up on day one or even beforehand, but I talked candidly with some staffs and they said to wait until the offer. I'm torn between what to do and would like some advice from someone who's been there or seen it first hand.

Sorry that I'm bringing this up again, but the other thread's reply was from an account that posted once and has not since been active, it would be nice to get advice from some active posters.


**EDIT**: Wanted to edit this just in case anyone in a similar situation searches and comes across this. I ended up talking with the recruiter during week 2 of the internship. It was about 2 weeks earlier than I wanted to bring it up, but the recruiter I had worked with was leaving and I didn't feel comfortable bringing it up with the new one. So I bit the bullet and told the outgoing recruiter in week 2 and she was super helpful and set everything in motion. From there I checked in on the status of the transfer throughout the summer, but the basic process was:

My office sends my info (application, resume, transcripts) to the other office -&gt; I work during the internship and get evaluated -&gt; My evaluation gets sent to the other office -&gt; Other office determines need/availability for transfers -&gt; If they have room they look over all of my info -&gt; Automatic offer or phone/live interview

She told me it is DEFINITELY important to bring it up PRIOR to the offer, because it creates a huge mess for HR if you wait to bring it up. My best advice would be to bring it up during recruiting and intern in the city you want to work in if possible. If something comes up (like my situation), definitely get ahead of it and don't be afraid to talk with the recruiter. Ultimately, the firm's view is that they'd rather transfer you than have all the money they've spent on you go to waste."

1enf8g,1,2013-05-19,A (hopefully) quick question about archival research and graduate admissions--,[deleted],AskHistorians,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1enf8g/a_hopefully_quick_question_about_archival/,"Hi /r/askhistorians! I forgot to ask this in either the Thursday or the Friday threads, and I've checked the archives so I don't think this has been asked before, but sorry for the longwinded spam!

Anyways, I'm interested in going to graduate school for twentieth century Britain and America, and I've been pondering my undergraduate thesis - there's money from my school to do research abroad, but you have to apply for it early (like as soon as the semester starts, almost). So, I've been working and doing a little preliminary research and I think I've got a topic that would be pretty well-suited for a thesis, and there's archives in London and Bristol that I think I could use. (I'm thinking the *Lady Chatterley's Lover* trial of 1960, if it matters.)

But my academic advisor (who isn't a history professor, such is life) has been really pushing that I try to wrangle some sort of public history/museum/archive internship in Washington, switch my topic to something else that I could research there (like the Library of Congress or wherever), and squeeze in the archival research on weekends. I'm not exactly keen on this plan.

I feel like an internship in Washington or wherever would be nice if I could get it, but 1) there's a chance I wouldn't get it, and then I've passed up on funding opportunities and the topic I originally wanted to research, 2) if I did get it, I wouldn't get the same funding anyways, and I'd have to do a different topic (I could probably find one, though), and I'm not even sure I could fit in all that I want to do on weekends or afternoons or what-have-you, 3) I'm not fully convinced that an adcom would place an internship, even if it's a prestigious one, over extensive research abroad (particularly if it's funded by grants).  Is this the case?

Also, for what it's worth, I do have one archival science related internship lined up (as part of my degree) -- so it isn't like I'd have zero internships. But I guess I'm trying to ask - how much do internships really matter? Will I really be screwing myself over if I don't apply for one and opt for the international research instead? Because that's really what I'd rather do, but I don't want to make a mistake and forever screw up my chances or something.

Sorry again for the long-winded question! I really appreciate the help.

I'm living at home while taking time off from college, and I got a job at a restaurant for the months that I'm home because I love cooking and I figured it would be something better to do than sitting on my ass all day feeling sorry for myself.  It's been a rough two months, but I think I've been getting a lot better.  

My boss has said the restaurant (a relatively new one) hasn't been doing so well lately, and everyone's hours have been getting cut.  I'm the low guy on the totem pole and probably one of the least competent, so I've gone from 35-40 hours a week to a bit over 20.  This is not a huge deal for me, since my paychecks are just going into my spending money and savings, and I'm fortunate enough to have my folks still supporting and feeding me and such.  For other people, though, I imagine the cut hours mean a lot more.

Yesterday was a crazy day at the restaurant.  One of the relatively new people got fired during the shift (he just really wasn't cutting it), and towards the end of the shift, one of the line cooks went batshit over something and flipped out/ragequitted (for the night at least, since it was at the end of the night). 

After all this, it really dawned on me that I'm carrying a good deal of responsibility on my shoulders.  I'm working alongside people whose paychecks go to actually putting food on the table, and I'm taking up a share of a limited number of man-hours which the restaurant can employ.  The thing is, I'm pretty sure I can get a job with better money doing work more often associated with people my age (being the 'intern' at an office).  I'm currently battling depression, however, and I think that sitting at a desk brooding all day wouldn't be good for me.

I don't feel like I'm a waste of man-hours, and I'm not a big detriment to the kitchen (if I was either of these things, I'm pretty sure my boss would have let me go by now).  Moreover, I'm pretty sure I'm making less than my co-workers (and rightfully so), so my hours cost the restaurant less than everyone else's.  But I feel a bit guilty about holding this job in this economy and while the other folks in the kitchen actually have their paychecks going to feeding, clothing, and housing people.


I know I don't belong in this industry long-term, and I don't intend to be here long-term.  I'm a good cook and I do my best as a worker, but I know that I won't be happy working my ass off like this for years to come.  I'm just trying to do my best until the time comes for me to go back to school.  But I'm wondering if it would make things a lot easier in the restaurant for me to go work at an internship like the rest of my friends are instead of having a job with consequence and where my co-workers' paychecks actually mean something.

Would I make things easier if I were to quit and work somewhere else?  Am I just exhaggerating things and making too big a deal out of there being poor job security in the industry?  Am I doing the wrong thing by being here in the first place when I don't intend to stick around long-term?"

I am a molecular bio major currently and was hoping that I could have some insight shed on my next few semesters. First off I should say that I intend on taking the MCAT and applying to medical school, being that it is a bit of a long shot I am also looking at BME or Bioinformatics in grad school if Med school doesnt pan out. I also got some poor grades in some intro classes that will need to be retaken to improve my gpa (the school will drop the initial grade and replace it with the grade after I repeat it to remove the poor grade from GPA calculations). That being said I will be through organic chem 1 and 2 over the summer and my fall semester is as follows:

* Genetics + Lab
 
* Cell Biology
 
* Introduction to Evolutionary Biology

* Human Systems Physiology + lab 

This totals 14 semester hours so far. I still need to take Physics 1 and 2 with their respective labs. 
I am considering restructuring this schedule to better prepare me for the MCAT in spring or after spring semester so I was thinking something more like:

* Physics 1 + lab
* Genetics + lab
* Cell Biology
* Intro to Evolutionary Biology
* Chem 1

This totals 17 hours so far and then in the spring take:

* Physics 2 + Lab 
* Zoology + Lab
* Molecular Biology + Lab
* Chem 2

This would total 15 hours and I would either take the MCAT in the spring semester or right after at the start of summer. After these courses would be completed I would still have to take Human Systems Physiology, Microbiology and lab, immunology, biochemistry, virology, and senior internship as well as one more repeat for GPA purposes. These last few courses would be spread over summer and fall or fall and spring of the 14-15 school year. I would start getting denied from med schools (just a joke, hopefully ill get in) after the spring semester of my junior year and should have enough time to also look at some grad schools in the area as a back up. Does this sound feasible or is there a better way I should be going about this? 

Thanks for your time

I am a CS junior in university. I started a year and a half long full-time internship about 4 weeks ago. However, from the get go, I did not click with the company. The environment, I feel is not conducive for learning. I did not like the product, nor did I find people I could look up to or learn from. 

This isn't my first job, though it is my first CS job, so I'm not sure if the expectations I had were too high. My classmates who also took on internships have had a very different experience. My day-to-day routine is nothing related to software development, I can't help but feel that I may not learn even a small percentage of what I expected.

So here is my question - should I suck it up and stick it out? Since, any experience at this stage could be considered good experience. Or, should I look for something new?

I'm working to get a Bachelors of Nutrition. I didn't want to do the Registered Dietician program mainly because of the 1 year unpaid internship. I don't have time, or the money to afford me not working for an entire year... or rather, working and just not getting paid. I looked at the curriculum difference and the only thing missing from the Bachelors program is added government regulation classes and food safety and sanitation. 
My career goals don't involve hospitals, jails or school cafeterias. I don't want to work in government. I mainly want to personal counsel, write, etc. 
Along with my Nutrition degree I am wanting a Life Coaching certification (with the national life coaching association, yes it's a thing), and I've been heavily toying around the idea of a Chef 2 year degree on top of that. Those three degrees would work so well together I think.

Anyway, a lot of people have said I'm dumb for not just going for the Registered Dietician thing. But, with my given interests and situation... Do you think I should be getting it? Just wanting some second opinions.

1emi7p,36,2013-05-19,Studying Engineering in germany. A Quick report.,3l3s3,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1emi7p/studying_engineering_in_germany_a_quick_report/,"Hi guys!
I thought i'd take a couple of minutes to give you a rough idea what it's like to study engineering in germany, mainly because I find that it is quite different from studying in the U.S. from what i read here.

**General:**
I study chemE with focus on biotechnology at one of the [TU9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TU9). I am currently in my sixth semester working on my Bachelor's thesis. I'm an active member of the students council and help other students with whatever they need to be successful in their studies.
**Edit:** In Germany it is absolutely uncommon not to get a master's degree. We had the ""Diplom"" before and as that took about 5 years, one is hardly considered a fully educated engineer without a master's degree. There are positions for bachelor's graduates tough, and also special combined programs working closely with industrial partners where you are part time at work in the company and part time at university and work full time once you got your bsc.

**Semester times:**
We have two semesters a year. Wintersemester from October through March, summersemester from april through september. Approximately half of that is filled with lectures. As a rule it should take 6 semesters to get your BSC, one of which is your thesis. Enrollment for most engineering programs only in the wintersemester.


**Lectures:**
We have approximately 6 different lectures per semester. Some of them come with extra classes where a TA shows how to solve problems and/or tutoring where you can solve problems yourself in small groups. Generally it is good advice to go to lectures and take exams in the order designed by the school. There are hardly any classes where attending is mandatory. Nearly all lectures are taught in german only. (There is a mechE program completely in english tough, and us chemE's have the same maths classes, so you could go ahead and attend those)


**Exams:**
Very unlike what I read here very often about a designated 'finals week' our exams are spread out over the entire time of the semester where there are no lectures. (I have had as little as a friday+weekend entirely free time after my second semester, most was about 4 weeks) This makes for about 2 weeks of studying time for each exam. This may seem odd to you, but from my experience, there are hardly any students that would pass the exams with significantly less time (they are frickin hard). Most exams are closed book closed notes but with formula sheets+ calculator. (Eg thermodynamics I + II closed book, closed notes, calc, formula sheet; higher mathematics i + II + III: lecturescript including notes + one published mathematical piece of literature + formula book + no calculator).


**Tuition:**
There is no tuition at most public universities. There is a relatively small administration fee (about 250€ per semester).


**Housing:**
There are dormrooms for as little as 150€ a month (9 m^2, including warm water and internet). Most people don't live in dorms, as there are not enough rooms available.


**Personal remarks:**
I am currently looking for an Internship abroad; unfortunately I want to intern during the winter. That makes it somewhat harder...


**TL;DR:**
Studying engineering in germany is quite different.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask!
**Edit:** added something to the general part"

1emg39,2,2013-05-19,My journey to day 13,blitzrain,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1emg39/my_journey_to_day_13/,"So yeah, I've been lurking here for some time. I have/had masturbation/porn-related ED, which was only apparent to me since last summer, which is where I stopped using my harem of girls and went exclusive on a girl. The harem of three-four girls was convenient; if I needed release, I'd call one of them, we'd have fun, and I'd throw her out the next morning. 

Going exclusive for one girl is my attempt to find back that high school sensation of having a girlfriend, but ""sadly"" it means having to abide by her period cycles. Thanks to her P-implant, she occasionally has very weird period cycles; at one time she had her period for three weeks straight. For a guy used to having sex four-five times a week at least, usually with at least two different women, having no sex but sleeping with a girl most of the week without having sex with her didn't really cut it. Blowjobs didn't do it for me in the long run. So I dug up my old harddrive, plugged it into my TV and started. Lo and behold, binging. Lo and behold, girls in general grew very unexciting. Unless I was drunk.

A few weeks ago, I attempted some tips here. I hung up a note on my cabinet, wrote ""NF"" and added a notch next to it for each day. I failed after three days. The next day I installed blockers on my browser, deleted all my porn, and cancelled my subscriptions to NSFW subreddits. I am currently on day 13 since then.

It hasn't been that difficult, it was worse the first days. My girlfriend blew me two days ago (shit was so cash), and as expected I suddenly got the cravings, but fought them down, since I had no external stimuli to go to; so it was back to finals reading instead. Libido is about nonexistent, but my girlfriend has her period, so it's not that big an issue yet. I feel that I can make it this time, without breaking and binging again. Till the end of the year, perhaps. It's bound to be challenging this summer, when I'll live alone in a small condo right next to my internship on the weekdays, with nothing to do after work than to work out, eat, sleep, read, hang on the internet... actually, there's so much else to do that I shouldn't have to feel the need. 

It'll be tough, but I can be a tough son of a bitch when I want to.

tl;dr: Install browser tools, acquire self control.

Thanks for reading. "

I'm graduating in June so I've been shotgunning my resumes everywhere. I had a few questions regarding cover letters for those experienced with either writing them or reading them (hiring managers).

1. How important are cover letters? Are those in charge of hiring briefly glancing over them or are they an important part of your decision?

2. Is it professional to include a little bit of your personality? I have a great sense of humor. My immediate superiors during my internship have commented on it on multiple occasions. Considering the fact that I will be working with a company for possibly years, is showing a little glimpse into who I actually am (and not just another engineer) beneficial?

He didn't have a choice in housing and thus is sharing a house that was provided by the program with a fellow female intern. I'm finding myself starting to feel slightly jealous and insecure. This is our first time doing long-distance and the fact that he's sharing a house and spending most of his free time with this girl is starting to get to me in ways that I'm not sure are appropriate or not. I see photos of them having fun and being goofy together on Facebook and my heart starts to hurt a little bit. Sometimes I feel angry. Is it understandable that I feel a little upset? Or does this ultimately boil down to my own insecurities? I feel like we have a pretty strong relationship (been dating for seven months now, known each other for three years, and there hasn't been a blip yet) and I don't think he would cheat on me, but it's not outside the realm of possibility that something could happen and that thought is perennially sitting in my mind. 


Also, do I tell him what I'm feeling? Or do I just let it be still and try to assuage my own insecurities the best that I can? I don't want to wreck this experience for him, because it really is a great program and he is going to gain so much, and I also don't want to cause bad relations or drama between him and his housemate. At the same time, I feel really really bad sometimes and I'm wondering if this is something he should know.

Things seemed to be hit, so we texted more and went on a few dates. He was pretty much a workaholic with a job that took up most of his time, but I really didn't mind much because I'm very active on campus with multiple jobs &amp; internships. I also wasn't looking for anything too serious right out of the gates. Anyway, I got way too drunk on our third date and we ended up having sex, which was pretty fine with me. We kept seeing each other about 1-2x a week and texted frequently, but never officially defined the relationship. After about 5 weeks of dating... BAM... he just stops talking to me. He stopped replying my texts &amp; at first I thought maybe he was busy with work. After about a week I realized that I was dumped by someone who didn't even have the decency to *actually* dump me.

It's been a few weeks since all was said and done. I *thought* I was over him, but I still find myself wasting way too much time thinking about how things ended. At this point I don't even care that things are done, or why they're finished, but rather why he just decided to stop contacting me. I've been running over how things went and I truly don't know what I did wrong. I sent him a text asking why (weeks ago), but of course I got no reply. And any further contact I would extend would just make me appear pathetic &amp; needy, but I just don't think I can move on until I get closure, which won't happen.

**TL;DR:** I got dumped by method of dropping communication, by a guy who I was only seeing &amp; sleeping with for about 5 weeks. I should be over it by now, but I'm still hurt by how things ended."

Specifically, I'm wondering if I should get something like [this](https://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?parentCategoryId=12205&amp;catalogId=10901&amp;categoryId=73499&amp;langId=-1&amp;productId=1061109&amp;storeId=10051&amp;seq=01) in the navy color, but I'm having a hard time biting the bullet on it. I've wanted a light jacket in this style for awhile but I'm not sure whether it's east coast appropriate or I would wear it in DC weather. Plus I don't want a jacket that makes me look about twelve in it, and I'm not sure how 'adult' this looks. I'm on a pretty tight budget so seeing this pop up on sale was perfect timing. 

To be clear, I'm working in a business casual office, so this would be for to and from work and out exploring on weekends. Advice?"
1eq1tk,20,2013-05-20,Communication,CreepyFishes,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1eq1tk/communication/,"Hey, /r/nosleep. I come to you all today in the hopes that you can help me identify a mysterious series of manuscripts regarding some rather strange topics. The manuscripts in question come from a shabby, nearly-destroyed manilla folder with no markings other than a red ""CONFIDENTIAL"" stamped on the front and a handwritten note - ""DRK1"" - in black pen on the back. It bears a resemblance to a military document, but this cannot be easily confirmed. The document was found by an intern in an old filing cabinet at a DOJ office I work at - because I'm not really supposed  to be in possession of classified documents, I'm going to not give out any personal details like the specific location. The document is slightly water-damaged and seems to have several red stains. It has also been redacted with a thick black marker.

I'm not sure exactly what the topic of the paper is, but it could very well be something from as early as the 60's or 70's due to the nature of how long the government keeps paperwork around. It also seems to be written like a bit of an informal log. Either way, I'd appreciate if anybody could tell me anything more it.

The document reads as follows:

----

DATE: [REDACTED]

*Day 1:*

Day one of our experiment - I must say, I'm rather relieved that we finally managed to get the approval of the POTUS. Unfortunately we have made very few friends in our negotiations - but that's irrelevant. In more practical matters, all of the subjects have been successfully acquired with minimal fuss and no notable media attention. The [REDACTED] has also been acquired, but that acquisition caused a bit of a scene which will be remedied with a few leaked stories about terrorists. In a related vein, the chambers have been prepped and will be used on Subject 1B tomorrow. 

*Day 2:*

[REDACTED] introduced successfully - however, Subject 1B is behaving a little differently than expected. Approximately four hours after an injection of a 1:20 mixture of [REDACTED] and argon into the chamber, the subject lifted his head and started humming to himself quietly. This was a marked change from his previous attitude, which was mostly concerned with the topical irritants we applied to his arms in order to accurately measure pain relief. The apparent analgesia caused by the [REDACTED] was to be expected, considering that it *is* a [REDACTED] derivative - however, the humming was not a symptom present in any of the [REDACTED] subjects, and may be indicative of some of the expected desired traits. Tomorrow the ratio of [REDACTED] will be increased in the hopes of achieving desired effects.

*Day 3:*

There is a slight issue regarding the subject's attitude. Twenty minutes after another dosage of the substance was released into the atmosphere, the subject's analgesia had progressed to the point of not noticing small cuts inflicted on him from behind body armor. However, this caution was likely not necessary - the subject has degraded into grinning and staring listlessly at the wall, humming softly. Oddly, this humming appears to be based on an Arabic style of music which features 24 semitones to an octave. The subject is also noted as quietly muttering to himself, though the exact nature of the dialogue cannot be confirmed, as every time the subject is approached he falls silent. In addition, the subject refuses to respond to any verbal or visual cue; however, he clearly understands the requests as he is later seen pantomiming the action in question. 

*Day 4:*

There have been three casualties of the guards today by an unknown assailant or group of such. All three guards were inside subject 1B's chamber when video feed suddenly cut off. This, of course, caught head security's eye immediately - however, by the time that a force could be assembled to investigate, the camera feed cut back on to the scene. Subject 1B was sitting in the same spot as before the deaths of the guards - however, the guards had been completely dismembered by some sort of non-explosive and non-ballistic weapon, seemingly akin to a mace or a sword. In direct contrast to this hypothesis, however, the force required to disassemble the human body in the manner that was demonstrated with the guards could not have been mustered by any human. Technicians are working on recovering any possible video feed and have still been unable to identify the cause of the feed blackout.

*Day 5:*

(Please note that the writing here has become very hurried and nearly illegible. I will thus present it as completely as possible without making any changes to help with readability.)

escape has become futile &amp; this message is to serve as a warning to any who may read it. [REDACTED] must not be used for test on human subjects in the future. a short recount of events: yesterday at 0900 hours oxygen supply to chamber was cut off to test endurance in low-oxygen environment. subject appeared to be completely unaffected and continued as normal. two guards entered the subject's chamber. No living witnesses were present at the scene when more personnel arrived  but the bodies of the guards were indistinguishable from one another as well as those of the onlookers. the subject was not present at the scene. all living personnel retreated to safe room in basement which became a slaughter as an entity, presumably the subject, killed everybody within reach. only three people including myself escaped and are now hidden in a spare room with no hope of escape. *containment procedure [REDACTED] was not initiated.* (This statement was underlined several times) entity may be at any location. only link between occurrences of violence from subject 1B was that in all instances verbal communication was occurring between victims within earshot. proceed silently and w/ caution

---- 

There was also a seemingly encrypted hand-written note at the bottom of the manuscript.

1eq118,1,2013-05-20,I need some serious advice about moving out.,DoubleADeep,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1eq118/i_need_some_serious_advice_about_moving_out/,"So right now I'm a student taking classes at my local community college to save cash. However I just finished out my last semester here and I'm now taking online classes at the university I've transferred too. I choose to take online classes to get a head start on what I'm going to be doing there. Heck I was already taking classes in the spring while still taking classes at my community college.

Now the issue is I'm going to move in the fall. The question is should I move now, (two months in advance) I think I may have jumped the gun and went for a few job interviews and I have three offers on the table. Not great jobs but enough to pay for rent in an apartment and utilities I've have to work two but only because one only gives me like four hours a day anyway.

Also I hate my current job, we were too efficient in our work and we got our ours cut because of it. I love what I do there but I hate the office environment.  However if I stay there for two months it will cover the cost of tuition for the classes i'm taking online which is about roughly 2 grand. I'm in a financial situation where 2 grand can make a big difference.

So now I have to worry about the apartments I've picked out now being available, jobs not being as plentiful as they are now and I just really need a objective outside view to help me make this decision. 

I could move out now, start paying rent and working at the jobs that will take me. While taking two online classes before gearing up for the fall.

 Or I could stay at home, pay no rent, work the job I hate and make the money back before I leave for the fall. However the job and apartment prospects may not be as plentiful at that time. The apartments were really nice, right across the street from the campus. I wouldn't even need to pay for a parking decal since I'd just walk to school everyday. 


EDIT: I don't know if it will help but at my current savings I'm covered for tuition for the next 2 years. About 60 credits in total. Since that's back to back fall-spring semesters. I plan on going in for internships in the summer to build my resume. The two grand equals either 7 credit hours or roughly 2 or 3 months rent at my month rent of 525 a month(that includes all utilities, and internet connection) ."

[What was the worst accident youve had? Worst one in your shop that wasnt you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2ig71?context=5)|[Answered about cutting off my nose here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2iqv1)
 |The one that wasn't me, I was working on a film production and the producer showed up a week in advance in a very expensive suit and probably $2,000 shoes. He walked in my workshop as I was forging his pieces. I explained to him that it's dangerous and he shouldn't be there.
 |I put the red-hot metal over to the side of the forge. He walks over to a work bench and picks up a razor-sharp knife I made and runs it across the ball of the thumb cutting it to the bone while asking if it was sharp.
 |I take him to the first aid center, and bandage him up. He walks back to the workshop, picks uip the blocks of metal I had just forged for his production, fusing it to his hand. He shakes off the metal that's fused to the skin of his hand and immerses it into a big plastic tub of what he thinks is water.
 |It's actually a phosphoric acid pickle used for cleaning the metal. So he's cut his thumb, burned his hand and immersed it into acid.
 |Shop etiquette: when you come into the shop, assume everything is hot, sharp, poisonous, and offensively rude.
[What was your favorite build on the show? Least favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hr6t?context=5)|Well the favorite build was Gimli's Axe, as I mentioned above. Pattern-welded steel.
 |My second favorite would have to be [Raphael's Sais](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-nI7xSmBHk). The bladesmithing, the forging of it required a lot of skill.
 |My least favorite would have to be [Captain America's Shield](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyFGE0Me9ug): due to time constraints it didn't come out as perfect as I like to make my work. I'd redo it correctly if given the chance. 
[How did you get into this line of work? Were you approached by film studios, or did you actively seek it out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2huks?context=5)|I started cutting gemstones and making jewelry from 7. At 13 I started cutting rocks professionally. At 15 I met the creator of the Conan swords, Jody Samson, who I pestered until he was willing to critique my work: a knife I made.
 |When I was 17 I went to a renaissance fair. Saw a guy making armor. He was using a railroad track as an anvil and modified hammers and chisels. He wanted $5,000 and a year's wait for a suit of armor. So I watched him work for a few hours, went home and replicated all his tools to make my own armor.
 |I was working as a machinist making stonecutting equipment in my early 20s. The business adjoining the shop I worked at was a prop house, and they saw the work that I created: the weapons, jewelry, leatherwork, and they commissioned me to make seven sculptures for Disney World, Epcot Center. That was in 1987. That same company referred the movie Hook, Michael Jackson's tour, and everything else.
[Of all the civilizations and styles that used pattern welding for their swords, who do you think did it best?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hqvr?context=5)|Probably the vikings. They were using pattern welded steel in the 7th and 9th century, and it created a very strong, durable sword. It's one of the better uses of pattern welded steel.
[What is the most requested weapon for the show that you might not be able to do? People say you can't do the Mastersword because it's been asked for too much or has already been done to death? Comments? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hxjv?context=5)|Master Sword will have to be done at some point, it's asked for so often.
 |When? You'll have to wait and see.
[Swords in the movies seem to be impossibly sharp. Chopping off heads like a warm knife through butter. Cutting lesser swords in half. What degree of sharpness is actually possible and what is the sharpest thing you've ever made?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2husx?context=5)|A sharp sword could definitely cut a lesser sword in half. I was interviewed for a Japanese TV show and forged a sword out of D2 steel. Shaved the hair off my arm to show how sharp it was, then cut through a piece of 4""x4"" oak beam, then took a 1"" round bar of unhardened mild steel, chopped through that, shaved off chunks of steel, then shaved my arm again. Then they realized there was no tape in the camera, and they had to do it all over again.
 |The second time, they lost battery midway. The third time went smooth and it maintained that sharpness the whole time.
 |I sharpen knives. My showroom's open to the public on saturday and I offer knife sharpening and razor sharpening while you wait.
 |My process will leave an optimal 1 molecule thick on the cutting edge of a blade. That is the sharpest it will ever be. Then it's just a matter of the type of steel whether it maintains that edge or not. I do that on the daily basis, they're all the sharpest.
 |Most of the pieces I make for film aren't ever sharpened (actors with a sharp knife?!). They're predominantly made out of aluminum for lightweight prop purposes.
[2\) Also, what style of weaponry would you say is your favorite? Things like types of swords (Katana, Rapier, Epee, Scimitar, Kilij, etc\) or daggers or polearms or the sorts.  3\) And in relation, what type of armor have you found the most interesting/appealing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hund?context=5)|1) I do take custom commissions. Right now I'm booked until about 2015. Most knives and swords cost $500-1000. I would need clean design work, and without seeing that I can't comment more on that.  2) Probably swords. They're what I make the most of.
[I live in NY, and would love to take up blacksmithing as a hobby. Whats the best way for someone with no experience to start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hsrn?context=5)|I'm self taught, but I don't recommend that route. I would join an organization such as ABANA - the Artist's Blacksmith Association of North America. They have regional affiliates, I don't know what the affiliate is in New York, it's probably the New York Blacksmith Association. In California it's the California Blacksmith Association.
[Also, I love the Man at Arms series, and would like to thank you for doing it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hsrn?context=5)|The affiliates have meetings and you can take classes from them.

That's more for burning man.

None of these pieces are for sale. These are my fan-based interpretations of other people's copyrighted products. I've probably had about a thousand requests for a damascus steel [Bat'leth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNcyzbcECbM) and 500 requests for [Finn's sword](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_HxKReSSlA).

[What was your favourite job you did for a movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hwlg?context=5)|Probably Hook back in 1991. It was my first big commission. To see my work on billboards throughout the world was really gratifying.
 |In case you can't tell, I made the title weapon. The hook.
[I hear you mention over and over how dangerous the grinders are on Man-At-Arms. Whats the worst injury you've seen in a shop? Worst injury you yourself have sustained?

 |I forged it from Damascus Steel, which is one of the things that makes it more exciting for me. It's actually a challenge to make the piece. It raised the bar over aluminum. It's a real weapon with folded steel.
[Tony, firstly let me say I love your show. Everything you make is so nice.

I'd go with a kite-shaped shield, I've made plenty of those.

That would have required a month and a half build time and we had three days notice. I had to use existing shop equipment that didn't match perfectly.
[Can you tell us more about the trouble you had with the Captain America Shield? It seemed the least polished of all your other entries. Was there anything you could have done to make it look closer to what it should, as if it was made from 1 block of metal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2htpv?context=5)|If I had more time to build it, it wouldn't have had the gaps on the medal. That's the problem a lot of people had - it didn't look like one piece because we couldn't have one piece to have that anodized color that I heard Stan Lee prefers.

Is it just ""copy the comic?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epkt7/i_am_tony_swatton_a_blacksmith_whos_made_weapons/ca2hvn7?context=5)|For Kroenen's swords I had a lot of input. They're based on a tonfa, a Japanese police baton weapon, but with edges all over. The grips were wire wrapped from my design and incorporating a black cabochon gemstone in the handle.
 |It was funny when United Cutlery got the licensing to reproduce that, Kit Rae called me trying to find the stones. The black stone that I cut the cabochon from was from a piece of obsidian I found while camping in Mammoth, CA.

So that means I'll have a six month gap between finishing my degree at the end of December and (hopefully) starting a PhD program in August. 

Now I'm aware that that PhD positions in the US do not pay very well, and since right now I have zero in savings I'd like to use that time to earn some money. But, I'd also like to leave for the US asap to sort of ""acclimatize"". 

Does anyone know of any job or internship opportunities that would be open to international students? I would love to do an internship at some company, but I'm afraid that I won't have that many skills to offer since I've been focusing on theoretical physics. To be honest I wouldn't even know what kind of companies to get in touch with. Teaching could be an option since I have some prior experience, and I have heard that test prep companies hire students as teachers, but only part-time. It would of course be ideal if I could go to the grad school where I will end up going and do some preparatory work there, but I don't think I would find out until late march or so if I'd even get in. And REU's are off the table since I am technically already a grad student. 

Any advice is appreciated!"

I just received my MPH and have only had internships, great internships, internships that I should be proud of: but nobody is actually giving me a chance to work for them.

My masters, according to hiring managers, makes me too qualified for entry level...

but because I've only had internships (in this field) they don't want to hire me for anything more than entry level.

My interview on Friday went like this:

- genniside, this job is called an analyst but it doesn't have any real analyst responsibilities - you don't want this
- I know someone who may have a different position for you, so you may hear from HR about it.

This has happened to me 2 times before, and the end of the story was that I was underqualified for the other positition and didn't get an offer from either.

In this particular instance (last friday) I wrote an email saying I don't know about the other job when I am really looking for entry level work. Basically telling her that she may perceive me as being over qualified for the job, I do not see it in that light.

2 questions:

Did I do the right thing by sending that email?

How do I escape this paradox and actually get an entry-level job?

Thanks, any help will ease my mental health. Seriously. So stressed over these dumb situations I get myself into."
1epq2a,1,2013-05-20,Junior Year,YourDrillSergeant,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1epq2a/junior_year/,"I just finished my junior year of college for a degree in Computer Science at a pretty tough university and I just needed to get something out there.

I've been pretty insecure of my intelligence ever since elementary school. My teacher used to call me a dunce (this was in a different country where it was acceptable for teachers to emotionally and physically punish underachieving students) and I've never had any confidence in my own abilities. Because of this, I became extremely introverted, somehow finishing high school (in the US) without ever making a single friend.

Now, I actually did fairly well in high school and got into an Ivy League school, but my insecurities stayed with me (in part because some of my high school teachers told me that I would never amount to anything) now blossoming into not just issues with my intelligence, but also with my appearance. I did poorly both socially and academically my first year at college, barely making a 2.9 GPA even though I pretty much just locked myself in the library all the time, and ending the year without any support or friends and severe social anxiety. At the time, I realized that any chance I had of getting into graduate school was probably dashed. During the first month of summer that year, I slipped into really deep depression; the suicide of a close friend nearly had me at a tipping point, and one night, while my friends were out without me, I seriously considered ending it right there and then. I made myself sleep on it, and I finally decided against it the following morning.

I began pulling through at the beginning of my sophomore year. I used to be very overweight, but I started working out that semester and shed close to 40lb to date (but more importantly, I got over the fear of going to the gym and being judged). I finally got a roommate, and we became extremely close friends; he helped me get over most of my social anxiety and make new friends, and I actually became quite happy. Without the constant anxiety, it became easy to focus on classes, and I pulled my GPA up to a 3.4. Still not great, as I couldn't even find a summer internship (I still had to use the freshman GPA when applying in the fall), but things are finally starting to look up.

Over the summer of my sophomore year, I promised myself that I would put all of my energy into getting as high a grade as possible the following year, and I'm proud to say that I have pulled through.

I have just earned a 4.3 (equivalent to an A+) on all of my classes this past semester (and about a 4.2 average for the entire year) which pulled my GPA up to a 3.75 (equivalent to an A-). Not only that, I also took the hardest courses offered here including a few graduate level courses. Two of my professors have now asked me to be their research assistant and I've been asked to TA two classes next semester. I even got several job offers and I finally have a shot at grad school! For the first time in my life, I actually feel accomplished.

Unfortunately, this did take a toll on my social life. I do feel like that I have regressed a little bit. In order to juggle between all of my classes, I pretty much studied endlessly this year and hanged out with friends less and less. I ended up losing a close friend of mine and have recently started feeling alone again, but I hope that this will change once I move into a new environment with new people and fresh faces (only a few people are still left on campus). 

One more thing that I'd like to address: I have never had much luck with girls before. I had been interested in a close friend for the first two years of college only to get shot down, which made me quite defensive around girls. I am very inexperienced, and because of this, I often don't know how to behave or what to say. I don't think I'm unattractive: I'm pretty oblivious and even then, I've picked up getting hitted on many times; unfortunately, I usually just clam up whenever this happens to me.

Anyways, thanks to anyone who had the patience to endure through this incoherrent mess. Hope things will look up for you guys too :) "

My question is this: should I put down both charges or just the second MIP that actually shows up on my record. I'm a little confused on what I should put down before they do the background check.

I recently completed my Masters degree in a mental health field and had an internship at a local psychiatric hospital during my advanced year. The hospital doubled as one of the only public hospitals for more than 40 miles, so we received most of the people with mental illness and/or substance abuse problems from a wide area.

Through that experience, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with local law enforcement. By the time I completed my internship, I knew most of the officers by name and am still friends with a few of them. It often was beneficial for both sides of the aisle to have a good working relationship, as it was a lot easier to know what to expect out of each other beforehand without having to be explicit. Different patients responded differently to our various skill sets, I suppose.

I know I shouldn't generalize, but having you guys around made it a hell of a lot easier to work with patients that were incredibly drunk or high as a kite on bath salts. In the same vein, I think the local PD appreciated us stepping in when someone was suicidal or depressed. I don't think I'd want to be a LEO, but to be fair, many police officers have told me that they wouldn't want my job either.

I hope that I can maintain a positive relationship with law enforcement throughout my career. Keep your heads up and stay safe out there."

I should probably start with a little background information. It doesn't matter how hard I try, I will still get bad grades in school. Even though I'm nearing the end of High School, I still have no idea what I want to do with my life, absolutely no idea. Now, this is not really my problem, the real problem is a little more sophisticated.

In the fourth year of the course I'm currently doing, it's mandatory to go on an internship to a country where English is the native language. For my internship I went to Maidstone in England. I stayed there for 2 weeks with a lovely family. I had an amazing time and I was very happy, everybody thought of me as a very clever guy and people only saw the ‘good’ side of me.

But when I came back home, I felt very different. My home reminded me of how bad I am in pretty much everything I do, it reminded me of every single bad characteristic I have.

This, and some other factors, have resulted in me not feeling at home anymore. My home reminds me of how miserable my life is, I feel like I have no future, and I have absolutely no motivation to do anything anymore. I would rather just stay in bed all day because I don't really care anymore.


I don’t even know what I’m supposed to do anymore, I feel like shit.  I really want to talk about it with someone, but I don’t know who. I was hoping someone here could maybe give me some advice, because I’m absolutely clueless on what I should do, I have never felt like this before.

I picture being famous and important. I picture my friends looking up to me and having a steady income, attending parties with famous people and being interviewed. I’ve often written about others as well – the influential businessman, the wealthy entrepreneur. 

I picture these instances, because I know that I am capable of becoming these things, if given the chance. In the end I do not know how. 

I want fortune to smile upon me, showing me with money, praise and admiration. But it never does. 

And I walk the city streets, hoping to be discovered for my style, hoping to that chance encounter with a businessman who is impressed with my youth and ambition. But these never come. It depresses me sometimes, when  I think that I am twenty-five and jobless. And it depresses me when my roommate writes me a text message about throwing detergent into the washing machine like I am his intern or stay-at-home wife, because he thinks that I am at home doing nothing of importance and therefore can do his laundry. And it depresses me when I think of my future – which at this point is so insecure and on such a darkened path, that I cannot picture where I will and a week from now or a year from now. 

It is not that I do not want to work – it is that I do not know what to work at. In truth I want to work and I want to work hard.  I want to make money and earn respect and meet interesting people and intellectuals, but aside from drifting through expensive bars at night, hoping for these one-in-a-lifetime encounters, I do not know what to do. 

There is always the possibility of taking the entirety of the bottle of Xanax in my desk drawer, but I do not really have the balls to do that, and I would hate to think about what it would do to those around me. That is not a solution, that is giving up. It is there though. 

And so I wish and I wait and I write lists of what I want.  And the feeling in the pit of my stomach comes and goes, and the feeling of depression and hopelessness comes and goes. And I print and I write into this little book, documenting my feelings and sometime adventures, the writings getting so personal that it is really not fit for anyone but myself to read. Lamentations on life and New York City, the world and women.  The mantra, “kill myself, kill myself,” floating through my head at night or when walking down the city streets. And I do not know what to do.

College is ending in a week and my friends - people I've known from freshman year and even high school - are always hanging out with each other for one last hurrah before various internships and jobs take us apart.

Problem is, everyone has a girlfriend or boyfriend and these events become ""couple"" events, except for... you guessed it! Me. I'm the one single person tagging along to the restaurants, to the parks, to the clubs, in the last few days/weeks.

""But premeddit,"" you may say. ""They're your *friends*. They don't care if you're single, go have fun with them!"" And this is probably true, but I still feel so incredibly frustrated by seeing them holding hands and cuddling and making eyes with each other that it doesn't MATTER how much of friends they are with me. All the friendship in the world couldn't make up for that total withering that happens inside me when I see such behavior which just reminds me how much of a loser I am.

Recently I've started to back out of events. When we went to a club last week downtown, I snuck out after once again being rejected by the random single girls I asked to dance. I snuck out and walked around the building for a while, my phone and texts constantly ringing from my friends asking where the hell I was.

I've asked out so many girls this year, put myself out there so much, developed so many hobbies, and nothing. Now I get to watch as the end of my college experience becomes a tapestry around me, of what could have been and what I'm missing out on.

Should I suck it up and go hang out with my friends before we all go to different parts of the country? I really want to be with them. But I don't want to feel this loneliness and frustration.

I guess this post doesn't have much of a point, just me rambling and letting this shit out. Thanks for listening."

My cramps are brutal even after taking 6 Advil, my lower back hurts so much I can't quite stand up straight, and the flow is... well, it feels like 5 months worth, so I'm doubled up with pad and tampon, running to the bathroom to ""change"" frequently.

My supervisor is a woman so she might be understanding, but I don't want to give her TMI if I call in and I don't want to look like a flake.  

Any advice on how to handle this?"

SF State's website is pretty sparse, I can't find a course list or any kind of manual.  Anyone know of where I could find either of these?  Also, if you have attended SF State's MSW Program, what did you think about the program?

San Jose State's focus on a multicultural approach really interests me.  Has anyone done their MSW at San Jose State, what are your thoughts on the program?  Also, I can't find any real information about the competitivity of the MSW program.  Is it considered as competitive as SF State and CSU East Bay?

As for Chico, I'm a bit concerned about lack of internship opportunities living in a smaller city.  Has anyone attended and can offer some insight?

Last, has anyone done the Title IV-E program?  How competitive is the program?  Was it easy for you to find a job in child welfare services after graduation?  Did you find that all the child welfare services jobs were case management or are there more options?  Do/did you enjoy working for child welfare services?

Some info: I'm a 20 year old girl who just happens to be an asshole magnet.

Around mid last year, after being strictly platonic with Elmo for more than a year, we decided to give the whole relationship thing a try. The relationship was wrong from the start, as Elmo was in a relationship at the time and he basically cheated on his then-current girlfriend to be with me. Yea, I was stupid but that's not the point of the story. 

Additional info: this guy got kicked out of his house after he beat the shit out of his own father, had to stay with me because he had nowhere to go. Didn't have any money at all, so obviously I was financially responsible for his fucking well-being. I gave him food, clothes, a working phone (after he smashed his phone to the wall one day when he got angry at me), and money. He literally almost never paid for a single fucking thing while he was dating/living with/leeching off me for about 10 months.

Fast forward 8 months, Elmo turned out to be a complete asshole. I found out he was cheating on me through MY WhatsApp history (Yes, he cheated on me while using my cellphone. Low sunovabitch). Also found out that he's been using MY car to meet up with random skanks, take them out, take them back to their places and sleep with them (Keep in mind that he used my car when I was sick, sleeping and/or he just borrowed it saying that he needed a car to go to his friend's house to study).

Also found out that he has been cheating on me several times from friends who has seen him in public with different girls (using MY car) and paying for them using MY money. 

Once, I also went out with Elmo and a few friends and 2 juniors of mine. I had shit to do so i didn't stay long and I had to take myself home to my parents house. Since I can't have Elmo following me around as my parents hate his guts, I suggested for Elmo to catch a ride with the others which he gladly did and ended up harassing on of my juniors/forcing her to kiss him (BTW, the junior was his best friend's little sister) .

I finally had enough of that shit and confronted him, which only ended up with him slapping me, dragging me out of the house, smothering me while I was trying to scream, banged my head against my car, picking me up and threw me to the floor. All of this happened at around 3/4 in the morning while it was raining hard so none of our neighbours had any clue of what was going on. 

(Now this was my fault) We broke up but still kept in contact and hung out together. there were no feeling left, but I guess I was just used to having him around. He had to leave to Europe for an internship so we parted. 

i ended up dating this really nice guy, Ari, who I've also been friend with for about a year. As you've figured, Elmo goes all batshit crazy. He started calling my close friends, asking them where I was, who I was with, what I did that day, etc. This went to a point where I start getting complaints from my friends, saying that Elmo was utterly annoying. One friend even had 88 missed calls from Elmo within an hour. He also started stalking all of my social media accounts, sending me texts saying something like ""You replied his tweet, why won't you reply my messages?"" or ""I know you're online"". 

He also started sending me messages saying how he doesn't have money to eat there, how he has lost so much weight since he got there, basically saying how he is just suffering in Europe. A friend of mine who is also doing an internship there and sees him every day said he was doing just fine. He also went to a point where he told my best friend that he was using drugs, and that he wanted to commit suicide. Luckily my best friend didn't really give a shit, knowing that he is well known for his over-dramatic behaviour. 

The cherry on top of the cake was when he threatened to kill my friends and my family members if I didn't want to get back together with him. So obviously, being tired of all his shit, I told my dad about this Elmo guy, who calmly said that he wouldn't mind taking this whole thing to court if Elmo won't stop harassing me.

Eventually all the crazy stopped. I have blocked him on every social media app available, but I still hear from friends that he still tweets about me sometimes. As for today, I am still happily dating my boyfriend Ari and haven't had Elmo trying to reach out to me for months. Thank God for that."

I am just passing a year post graduation without having a single job offer. This worries me. 
I have had a handful of responses and even less interviews. My concern is that my experience is stagnant and it isn't helpful when they ask me what it is I currently do. I don't mind doing internships and relocating isn't an issue either.

I spend hours drafting cover letters for these amazing companies I want to work for and then submit it on their cookie cutter online application processes, probably getting lost in a sea of other applicants. I know there are things I am doing wrong and I can only blame so many variables at once right."
1eoief,17,2013-05-20,Getting the ball rolling (story inside),LightDownpour,comingout,https://www.reddit.com/r/comingout/comments/1eoief/getting_the_ball_rolling_story_inside/,"I've known since freshman/sophomore year in high school that I was gay. I denied it, rationalized it away, ""bargained"" with being bi, everything. Graduated high school and nothing happened. I'm normally really shy, but I told myself that in college that I'd be open to whatever happens. My best friend from high school is the only person I know in college (Auburn, for reference). I still couldn't take that step. We end up joining the same fraternity and I repress my feelings. I take girls to formal and date functions (never leading them on), make friends, etc. college happens, but in hindsight, I'm not happy. Sitting here, I still don't know how to describe what exactly I was feeling. My mind was deluding myself the whole time, trying to act straight, but watching gay porn, and I can think I could be straight? I'm an idiot. Well, three more years fly by and Junior year ended. Still no girlfriend, still no honesty within myself. I sit there so close, but again I cant take that step. I'm not sure if its my hyper-sensitivity to my sexuality or paranoia, but I feel like the people around me are dropping hints. My mom and aunt have talked about a gay cousin in front of me, my previously-mentioned best friend has sat down outside with me on many occasion just to relax and talk about everything, and once when catching up with an friend at lunch, I make a comment about my lab partner and she asked if I was out (I take it back, in hindsight I'm a MASSIVE idiot). I just can't do it. When the marriage-equality debate came up a few months ago and my roommates and brothers voiced their support, I felt so tempted to use the moment to come out then and there. From what I can tell, everyone I care about around me is just waiting for me to come to grips with myself, but I literately cant. I read some of the posts here talking about how things have gone so right and I feel uplifted; I read the posts here talking about how things have crashed down around them and I'm terrified. I cant count the number of nights I've cried myself to sleep thinking of worst-case scenarios. My family is very close to me and losing anyone would kill me. The thought that someone in my life could walk right out is killing me. I'm bawling right now typing this, and I dont really know how to encompass everything I'm feeling. 

This summer I have an internship in a different city, and I finally tell myself FUCK THAT! I am gay. No rationalization, no caveats, no nothing. I build an OkCupid profile and I can just fucking nut up and deal with any consequences later. I am going to do something with my life. A couple of days later I chat with a cute guy and I meet up at his place. The movie ends and we get closer; every moment my heart was furiously beating in my chest and silly ""this is the last moment to turn back"" thoughts tried to surface. We end up hooking up, and I do spectacularly awful (thanks a bunch nerves). It isn't until we're texting the next day that I notice that I'm happy. Not just happy - beaming. I have 0 regrets and a lot of anticipation for the future. I did it. No matter how many people I end up coming out to, I have fully accepted myself and it feels AMAZING! Now all that's left is the rest of the world."

I wasn't sure where else I could ask, but I am looking for advice.  
I am a college student, I work full time at a decent job making $9 an hour and I also attend school 12-15 credit hours a semester, 2 nights a week right now.  Before I transferred from community college to a 4 year university I was majoring in accounting, something I wasn't really that interested in.  After speaking with a few people and some family members, I decided that Marketing would be more intriguing and more fulfilling throughout my life as it seems that there are a lot more opportunities for a Marketing major, but I may be wrong. 

I have been looking for internships on and off for the past 3-4 months and have gotten 3 phone interviews so far and have not gotten the jobs.  My interview skills need work, but they are getting progressively better I feel.  The problem was that all of my jobs going through my life until now (I got my first job when I was 14) have been acquired through friends or family.

Now that I am getting more serious with this Marketing career with my graduation date approaching in May of 2014 if all goes as planned, I am starting to second guess my decision to switch from the usual job that my family has chosen (we have 6 accountants in my family) and went with Marketing for reasons that I thought it would be better for me.

My problem that I am coming across now is that I feel that I will not be good at this.  Granted I have only taken 4 or 5 core classes toward my bachelor's in Marketing, but I feel that I may be too introverted for the jobs that will come my way.  I know these things take practice and I have made it conscious effort to become more personable with people I encounter at work and have been working on talking to people, but can somebody with these kinds of social skills be successful in Marketing?  I believe I am a smart individual.  I get good grades, am highly motivated in my work, and feel that I am a well rounded person who is quick to adapt to environments, it is just that before I am ready to make a huge jump out of my current job environment of 3 years, I want to have something where somebody will really help me learn. 

Do entry-level Marketing jobs all require sales?  Can I be a successful marketer without being a super salesman?  Sales is something that I really don't think I could do well unless it is a product that I truly believe in in an environment that people are looking for information, not looking for people to sell to who were not interested before, if that makes sense.

I am just looking for advice from someone who may have second guessed their major in college and what happened with it.  I know there are more things to do in Marketing besides sales, but do analysts, market researchers, internet marketers all fall under the same blanket ""Marketing"" degree?  

One more thing, if I want to specialize in the online side of marketing, is learning HTML, SEO, and even graphic design a must?  I feel like that would be really useful, just don't know where to start..  

I think I may be overthinking all of this. I am really looking for some insight here.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How often does someone get falsely convicted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca20rwq?context=5)|It is impossible to know how many innocent people are in prison. There have been 1,000's of documented cases of innocence. If just 1% of the people in California prisons are innocent, that means more than 1,700 innocent people are in California prisons alone. 
[What crimes would you guess that a person would be most often wrongly convicted for?  And sorry your walk has to end in Sacramento. That's going to be kind of a let down after walking so far.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca275ku?context=5)|We hear every day about exonerations of people who were convicted of rape and murder, but that's because, in those cases, there is often DNA that can prove innocence. I am sure there are actually more innocent people convicted of lesser crimes, such as drug crimes, but it is very difficult to prove innocence in those cases after you are convicted. 
[What do you think the odds are of the gov acting on the petitions you are delivering?  Do you think walking them is increasing the odds?  What if he's going to sign them any way, and your walk is just keeping these prisoners locked up for an extra two months?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca23epl?context=5)|We think the odds of the Governor granting the petitions are far better if we have the support of the community.  The walk is intended to raise awareness, while garnering support for our innocent clients in prison.  Since the majority of the California Twelve are at the end of the road, this is their last chance to seek freedom.  We want the best chance for our clients, and our chances have increased already in the first 23 days.  We have received word that the Governor is aware of the march and will assign his top aide to review the cases.  We just hope with your support he'll take it seriously.  Sign the change.org [petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/governor-jerry-brown-grant-clemency-for-the-california-twelve) to encourage him!
[Have you ever had to defend someone who you knew was guilty? What did you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca23o8p?context=5)|Criminal defense attorneys represent the guilty every day. All people, whether innocent or guilty, are entitled to a fair trial and representation. However, The California Innocence Project is devoted solely to representing innocent people who have been wrongfully convicted. We only take on cases where there is strong evidence of innocence. 
[That kind of sucks for innocent people who don't have easy cases, doesn't it?  If the judicial system needs you guys to clean up the obviouse screw ups, who is cleaning up the ""medium evidence of innocence"" cases?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca289oi?context=5)|Let me assure you that none of these cases are easy. The burden of proof to overcome a wrongful conviction is extremely high. Only cases with strong evidence of innocence have a chance. Of course, we spend time trying to change policies and procedures (such as I.D. procedures) to decrease the number of people who are wrongfully convicted.
[Would you walk 500 more, just to fall at my door?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca21bzh?context=5)|If you're innocent.
[If a police officer asks my name or other information, what do I have to tell? What are the ramifications of not speaking to him or refusing to answer any given question? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca21m51?context=5)|You have a right to remain silent and never answer any questions.  It could be deemed suspicious in some situations but you can never be compelled to talk.
[Can I be taken to the police station and/or arrested for remaining silent or otherwise compelled to leave where I am? Does this vary state to state?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca21pqe?context=5)|You cannot be arrested solely for being silent, the police must have probable cause to arrest you.  You can, of course, be compelled to leave certain ares (such as private property).  State laws vary on what is criminal, but probable cause for arrest has been established by the US Supreme Court and applies throughout the country.
[I was listening to a Radiolab episode titled ""Are You Sure?"" that was about a women who had sent a man to jail who she believed to her rapist. The Innocence project freed him with DNA evidence. He unfortunately went on to actually kill a women and is now in jail.  I suspect that most people freed don't go on to commit major crimes, but what is normally done to reintegrate these people into society after they have spent years in prison culture?  Are there any major success stories of freed prisoners who went on to do extraordinary things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca20tvy?context=5)|There are very few cases we know of where someone was exonerated and then went on to commit a crime.  Unfortunately, our system is not set up to help these exonerees re-integrate back into society.  It’s a strange thing because, if you get out on the parole process, you actually have more reintegration services available to you than someone who gets out on innocence. As for successes, we have had some great success cases.  Recently, our office helped exonerate Brian Banks, a high school football star accused of rape, spent time in prison, and who was eventually exonerated.  He just signed with the Atlanta Falcons. He even came out to march with us during an event in Malibu. Here is a photo of Brian and Justin at this event addressing the media  [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/JDGpi3x)
[What leads to wrong convictions? Does corruption play a factor in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca2294m?context=5)|The leading cause of wrongful convictions is bad identifications. The worst identifications are cross-racial (I.E. black people identifying white people, or vice versa). Other causes of wrongful conviction include false ""snitch"" testimony, false confessions, and junk science. Also, there are some cases where police and prosecutors falsify evidence, but those are rare. Wrongful convictions usually happen due to mistakes, not deliberate ""set-ups"".
[What about False Witness ? Charges stemming out of spite or ""Revenge"" because a person felt wronged. That is what I suffered. I broke up with a girl in a pretty bad way ( Publicly , I was young and dumb 17 years ago. \) and she falsely accused me. That is why I asked about Pennsylvania.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca22rya?context=5)|Yes.  False witness testimony is the leading cause of wrongful incarceration.  Sometimes it is just mistaken identifications.  Other times it is false snitch testimony.  Sometimes it is just completely fabricated for some personal reason. 
[If the Governor does sign the petitions and grants clemency will the people be released straight away or will you have to go back to court for each person?  I think what you are doing is amazing.

Be Safe!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca20zus?context=5)|If the Governor grants clemency, these innocent prisoners should be released immediately and we would not have to go back to court.  We’re based out of California Western School of Law in San Diego, so they cover our overhead and salaries.  Students work during the school year as part of a clinical internship program.

[From the perspective of someone who lives outside of the US, I find it perplexing that there seems to be resistance from the judicial system to clear someone by DNA (or other evidence\). Is it a case of them thinking that they've 'got their man' and don't want to acknowledge mistakes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca2377d?context=5)|It is very difficult for anyone to admit they are wrong.  Prosecutors get very vested in their work just like other people.  Sometimes they have spent years getting a conviction and don't want to accept that it is mistaken.  That is understandable.

The prison officers union is the largest in California.  There are lots of people making lots of money building prisons and keeping people locked up all at the taxpayers expense.  That is a dangerous formula.  Politicians get elected on ""tough on crime"" policies, we build more prisons, lock up more people, and who pays?  In California, this is breaking our budget as we cut education budgets which results in more crime.  The war on drugs is a total failure just as the war on alcohol failed during prohibition.  We've filled the prisons with drug offenders and new offenders take their place in the business.  We need to somehow stop this crazy cycle...and yes I think innocent people get caught up in the business of policing and corrections.

We are doing our best to stay safe.  We all think people with no money get screwed in the criminal justice system when they round up their savings and hire a lawyer with no experience.  We tend to see quality work by public defenders.  A cheap private lawyer versus an all-powerful prosecution with nearly unlimited resources for investigation (police) and crime lab is tough to compete with.

Also, along the way we are holding rallies and walking with family members of our clients and people we have gotten out of prison to raise awareness. It's a powerful and difficult journey.

We fully understand how painful it can be for them when we reopen a case so we only commit to cases where there is strong new evidence of innocence.  Sometimes victim's family members reach out to us and are happy we are investigating the case because they have always had doubts about a conviction.  Other times they have not been happy and we have invited them to sit down with us and review the evidence.  Sometimes they take us up on that and sometimes they don't.  The bottom line is, everyone is hurt when there is a wrongful conviction.  The wrongfully convicted person is a victim and their family are victims.  Plus, there is often a guilty person at large in the community.

[What are your guys thoughts on the death penalty?  I mean there have been numerous cases of people wrongly being put to death and found out afterwards they were innocent, so does that change your opinion on its legalness... (not a word but do you think it should be legal everywhere\). And stuff. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca277v4?context=5)|I believe the death penalty violates the 8th amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Furthermore, the entire western world, except for the United States, has banned its use. The potential execution of innocent people is just one reason it should be abolished, but it is a very compelling one. I've sat on death row with clients awaiting execution. It's easy to support it in the abstract, but very difficult when you see it up close and personal. 
[Where are all of the rest of the criminal defense attorneys in California?  Why isn't there a cohesive movement?  This is an honest question.

[You are doing a terrific job answering everyone's questions.  Thank you.  Still I ask; where are the rest of the CA attorneys, concerned about the system?  There are obvious issues.

But we would certainly welcome the support of civil lawyers in reforming the criminal justice system. Often, criminal defense attorneys aren't listened to. A unique aspect of our program is that we're part of a law school (California Western School of Law). We're able to train future lawyers to care about these issues.
[Link to site.  How often do you take a case, do a lot of research and digging only to find your client really is guilty?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1entc2/hi_reddit_we_are_three_lawyers_and_an_unpaid/ca2300m?context=5)|That happens quite often.  Thousands of people write to us, and it is not surprising that some of them are guilty.  That is why we scrutinize every case and only proceed to court on cases where we have strong cases of innocence.  Out of the 1500-2000 cases we review each year we close the overwhelming majority of them.  We maybe do a full investigation on 50 cases a year and file in court on 5 of them after we have found compelling evidence (like DNA).  On a good year we walk 1-2 people out of prison and give them their lives back.  There are many more innocent people in prison, but once you are convicted it is tough to reverse the conviction.  We need hard evidence.

Our work involves collecting every document related to the case, interviewing witnesses, getting expert opinions, and getting DNA testing.  By the end of all that, we have a pretty good handle on whether someone is innocent or not.

We have an excellent relationship with the DA office in San Diego and we review cases together.  Sometimes police officers actually come to us with old cases they are troubled about.  But, we often are obstructed by District Attorneys and police, even in getting access to evidence rooms to see if evidence still exists.  Good DAs and police are interested in the truth.  In California, the further we travel from the ocean the less cooperation we seem to get.  Desert justice. Go figure.

The limit of appeals is that you can only raise issues that are in the trial transcript.  With habeas we can bring in new evidence.

My job title says ""Software Developer Intern"" yet they put me into the QA team for the system group that was hired for. The software architect stated that I would start in QA to become familiar with the system and then move on into development, but I am afraid that I may get stuck in this role for 16 months. This is because of several things:

* I came into this team with another new intern. He started in development immediately whereas I started in QA
* There are 2 old interns that are leaving in August and I'm working with them. I am afraid that I am supposed to be their replacement.
* The interns have been doing this since the beginning of the year now. So this indicates I may be QAing for quite a while at least.
* They cannot simply move me into another team. I would need to replaced. Just as I am replacing the old interns.

The next full release cycle of the product starts in July and ends in October. My ideal situation would be to experience one cycle as a QA and get out. I don't really mind being QA to get the experience of being one but I definitely do not want to be QA for 16 months.

How should I tell my manager that being QA is not what I expected and that I do not want to stay in this position indefinitely? Is there any timing that I should be aware of(like don't say it so soon since I've only been here 3 weeks)? How can I be diplomatic about this?"

I graduated with a BS in Accountancy and a BS in Finance. I had a 3.49 GPA in both. I graduated this past December, and since then, have been studying for and taking the CPA exam. I thought I would be done with it by now, but it's taking longer than I expected. I should hopefully have it done by August though.

Another big mistake I made (other than not working) was not networking. I spent college having fun (although I did relatively well in school as well.) I entered college thinking ""here comes 4 years of awesomeness"" without really thinking too far ahead of that. I kind of assumed I'd be fine, but I now realize that the job market is horrible.

I haven't yet started applying for jobs, but I will in the next few weeks. I'm applying everywhere. Even if it's a dead-end accounting job, or a finance position (i'm more interested in going into audit though.) I figure doing that and applying again to CPA firms in a year or 2 might work. Do I have any chance of getting hired by a CPA firm? I'm capable. I'm competent. I can do the job. A CPA firm would not be disappointed with me. It's hard to convince them that though when I'm competing with people who have relevant experience (in the form of internships) and have networked.

I answered the personality profile honestly, including questions about comfort levels with new people and confrontation, which is why I assumed I didn't get an interview for a claims position. How do I handle the situation professionally? The thought of turning down  a job offer before I even graduate kills me, but I sincerely think the position would not be a good match. Now it feels as if I am wasting their time if I stay on as a finance intern. They are training and paying me for a job in which they have no openings. Any advice? I know this is not the job market in which you can afford to be choosy. "

It's got one pipe running from the motor, which then splits off into 2 mufflers right below the trunk. I don't know how much longer I'm gonna keep this car, but I gotta do something about the noise and I don't want to dump any more money in this car than I have to. My question is, Could I remove one muffler and weld that side closed, and just replace one muffler with a cheap universal one? I replaced both before and it was like $150-175 bucks for the actual mufflers, I don't want to spend that much. 

If I replace it with just one cheap universal muffler, will this negatively impact the cars performance/fuel economy significantly? This summer I drive it an hour round trip to my internship, otherwise aside from the occasional trip back home it just drives around town the rest of the year.

My internship doesn't start until mid-summer, and when it does I will still have a ton of free time. Right now I spend it gaming. Thankfully my grades have not suffered, I have a great girlfriend and an okay social life. Even though it has not affected my life negatively, I realize I am addicted to video games. Whenever I have free time from schoolwork, I am playing video games. When I'm not actively playing, I'm always thinking about them, or spending time on forums reading about them.

Sometimes I'm not even having fun. I just play out of habit. I want to quit, because I feel like I am wasting time that could be better used learning skills to improve my quality of life. I've started learning music and how to play the tin whistle. It's a lot of fun, and I actually feel like I am improving myself by learning something myself and others can enjoy.

My only problem is I need things to fill several other hours of the day. I'm already in good shape and I exercise daily, alternating running and resistance training. I'm not looking for something like reading, because that's along the same line as video games, just entertainment. I'm looking for more something I have to learn, either something that will improve my life or just a cool talent that I can keep improving on (hence the instrument). Ideally away from the computer so I am not tempted to get lost surfing the Internet.

This kind of stuff is what makes me hate the church. Sometimes I get discouraged and bored with the church, but I can deal with that. I assume that people just haven't had the same experiences as me and they just don't realize how amazing life with God can be. That's alright.

But when I see things like this... people saying *right to a person who is being vulnerable* that they are advocating for satan... well, fuck that. I have plans to go back to the conservatives. I want to be among them. The church I'm attending now (and planning to intern at) is a conservative church. I want to worship with conservatives, have fellowship with conservatives, and follow Jesus with conservatives. I really just feel like giving up when I see this kind of garbage, though.

What makes people keep thinking and talking like this? Why are people unable to see that calling pro equality movements ""satanic"" is so hurtful? Why are people unable to just let things go? Let other people sin; it literally has no affect on your life whatsoever. This kind of thing seriously makes me want to give up on the church altogether, or at least the conservative side.

I was happier substitute teaching than I am trying to be a part of the church. It seems like people are more open to what God's doing out in ""the world"" than they are in the church."

We are Kroo, and we are an extremely small startup based in New York City. Our goal is to expose you to internships in an industry that you care about. All it takes is sign up with your email or facebook account right here at [http://kroo.fanbridge.com/](http://kroo.fanbridge.com/). 

I myself being a college student in New York City,  I find it so difficult to find and land an internship in the music business. It is such a niche market and simple google searches gave me very few results. And when those results turned up, I was turned off by how much expertise they demanded of me. I want to intern so I can learn, but companies are not willing to take people with no experience like myself. I was in a predicament. 

That’s when I realized it wasn’t only me who had that problem. So many others had that same problem, as I found my colleagues stuck in the same dead end I was in. 

And that’s where Kroo comes in. Kroo is an email list that sends you an internship opportunity with little to no barriers to entry, every day for just signing up. 

Right now, Kroo is still in limited beta. We can only find you internship positions in the music business located around Manhattan. In the future, we hope to expand to other businesses and other areas of the U.S. and perhaps beyond.

But for now, if you are located in Manhattan or near it, and if you are interested in the music business, we are here to help. 

So, if you want, please sign up at [http://kroo.fanbridge.com/](http://kroo.fanbridge.com/). We will try our best to find you an internship that you can apply to! 

With thanks,

I'm working M-Th. I tried to work all 5 days a week but they suggested doing 4 and enjoying summer. This is important because it seems like they're fairly flexible. I want to go to Bonnaroo. To do so, I'd have to ask for a Thursday and a Monday off. Is this frowned upon or generally acceptable? Do you think I'd be allowed to make it up by working two Fridays to cover the missed time? I don't want to look bad as they're known for hiring interns after graduation and it's in the practice area I want to work in after graduation. Is it worth asking for two days off or should I skip the festival?"

I am a summer intern for a place in Hartford (3 years now) and I'm curious as to what happened to the dirt lot Market street. Its still there, but I've noticed 50% of the parking lot is open compared to it usually being full every work day.

1errjd,2,2013-05-21,My goal is to become a Ruby on Rails developer. A few questions.,Guy_Cecil,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1errjd/my_goal_is_to_become_a_ruby_on_rails_developer_a/,"I, like many others, discovered codecademy through reddit and was blown away. Being currently unemployed I had a lot of time to put into the site, and 1000 exercises later realized I needed to pick one aspect and stick to it if I ever hoped to have a marketable skill. I chose Ruby and Ruby on Rails in particular, because I looked at the applications section of their site and saw the breadth of what was possible with this web framework.

Now, I have been working through the Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl, and while I'm only four chapters in and it still all seems like magic, I have successfully created a GitHub and a Heroku account and actually pushed these tutorial apps to them in a few days, which is more progress than I made in a month on my own with just codecademy. I understand that before I claim to be 'job-ready' I will need many more months of experience. 

My questions include the following: 

* I live near DC and would love to attend a conference or meet up of web developers or Ruby programmers, but I have no idea where to look, besides the one upcoming event, RubyNation, which with a $295 price tag, is currently out of my range.
* How can I best summarize my goals on LinkedIn? Other than ""I am an aspiring Ruby on Rails developer, seeking an entry-level or internship position as a junior developer, in a small company or startup."" Is it too presumptuous of me to send messages asking for advice to random strangers that I've found only by searching ""Ruby on Rails"" on LinkedIn?

I haven't even finished the Rails tutorial yet, so I must sound like I'm getting ahead of myself. But after so long being unemployed I just want to know what the best course of action would be to show that I'm serious. Once I have finished the tutorial my first goal will be to create a very simple app on my own and post it to my GitHub profile."

Like some of you, I was quite anxious about finding a job after graduating.  I had no internships under my belt, almost no contacts save my professors, only a couple of substantial personal projects, and a resume that consisted mostly of relevant coursework.  Really, the only thing I had going for me was a very high GPA.  After interviewing with only three different companies, I landed my first programming job.  

I understand my situation may be the exception, and certainly you should not discount the advice you will find in this sub, a lot of it is really good.  But to those of you who are like I was, who are discouraged that they may not have the most competitive, ivy league, ""rockstar programmer"" credentials, just know that it *is* possible.   Also, make sure you have a good relationship with your professors.  If you're a good student, they're your guaranteed network/connections.  One of mine is actually partly responsible for me getting this job.  He gave me the name and number of one of his industry contacts and a good referral.  So, make sure you talk to them and develop a good relationship outside of the classroom.

Good luck!"

It's now going on six months post-breakup after a 2 year relationship, and I feel like myself again, for the most part, so keep your heads up and keep moving forward while focusing on yourself! 

Recently, I moved back to her neck of the woods for an internship. I don't really like it around here, but the opportunity I have exceeds any uncomfortable feelings. Anyway, I have been no contact and she's been blocked since a few days after she broke up with me over the phone. I got a friend request the other day from a person who I thought I had met through another friend. I found out after I accepted that she goes to the same grad school as my ex. She invited me to a small get together, then deleted me off Facebook a few hours later.

I'm pretty sure now I met her through my ex and not another friend late last year, so I think she friend requested me so my ex could see what I was up to. Why would she do that, hell why would she invite me to an event then delete me? This is bringing me back down now, because all I can think about is my ex, and my surroundings aren't helping either. 

r/BreakUps, help me understand the motivation behind this. I just want to be left alone, and if my ex ever wanted to contact me she still has my phone number, not that I would answer or reply. She made herself out to be the mature one, but I'm beginning to see the opposite is true.

Thanks!

TL;DR: Moved back to her hometown for an internship, random friend request from girl I met through my ex of six months last year, accepted it, invited me to event, then deleted me a few hours later. Feeling myself falling back down into the hole I just dug myself out of."

I finally got an internship lined up the only problem is that it requires me to live down home with my parents, but it'll get me the money/experience I need. So here's the plan:go down south in a few days, finalize the job to start working the week after next, then I can come back to my apartment, and melt my face off after my longest tbreak in the past two years of regular smoking. Just a few questions for the hell of it if you feel like answering 

1. What kind of job do you work at this summer?Do you like it, how often do you work, and how often do you go to work high? Did you have to pass a drug test before you started?
2. What is your favorite thing to do with your friends while smoking? what about your favorite thing to do when its just you lighting up?
3. What are you most excited about for the summer of 2013? Is it an awesome party, music festival, vacation, or something totally random?

TLDR: I haven't smoked in over a month, it SUCKS. I envy all my fellow ents out there who get to enjoy their trees but I will soon return and I could not be more excited. asked some questions above^

What should I do? UPDATE: I need 'acknowledgement' from my University or I cannot legally take this job because it's unpaid. Strange....**

So this summer, I had been searching for internships for over a year now, throughout college. Unsuccessful; email after email of ""oh, please send me your resume and we'll see what we can do"" without further contact from said person. Summer has come and still no offers, so I take up a job in a nearby plaza since I don't have a car (walking-ish distance). Any income is better than no income and sitting at home, right?

Well, this one company finally emailed me back THIS MORNING, right after I've accepted the job offer at the near by store. It's an internship. My first internship. Something that'll spruce up my resume so I can work my way up to a job in my field.

But.... I feel rather rude suddenly going back to the store and saying ""well...... so I got this internship"". I'd love any advice. I'm rather torn....

UPDATE: The internship I applied for contacted me a few hours after posting this, and offered the internship to me officially, and said they'd send an ""official"" letter. I get a call back about half an hour later saying that I cannot be offered the internship if I am not being 'acknowledged' for this work by the University, whether it be in the form of credits, or a written letter by one of my professors saying ""yes, I believe this internship will benefit xConfuzzle in her future studies"". My professors have also been very...... limited in email responses, even during the semester due to a ginormous amount of incoming letters. I have a week to obtain acknowledgement.

1erbge,101,2013-05-21,Salary/performance review... am I planning on being too aggressive here?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1erbge/salaryperformance_review_am_i_planning_on_being/,"I have a salary/performance review coming up and looking for some feedback on my plan. Last year I was moved to a full time position in my company, I've been with the company several years now going from intern to part time to full time. We were a team of ~5 when I started, and we've grown to 15+ and I have trained almost all the new members in some capacity over the years.

When the full time offer came, I was ecstatic. I had been paying out of pocket for insurance, and they had been dangling the idea of a full time position for at least a year at that point. I had also gone from 25 part time hours to ~50-60 hours with overtime. My responsibility was increasing. I was so happy about the full time offer that while I did negotiate, I didn't stop to consider that management was offering this for their own advantage.

Shortly after we negotiated my salary and I accepted the offer, my responsibility increased probably 3-fold. A senior member of my team left for another team, and I have taken his place. Some weeks, I have calculated it and my salary works out to a lot less than I would be making at the hourly rate, BUT...

My job is extremely flexible. I work from home since I moved to a new city, and I have only been back maybe 3-4 times for meetings since then. I am sometimes given comp time off when I work a lot(when possible). My company fully covers all insurance costs for a pretty decent plan. If I decide to have a kid in the next couple of years(we are considering it), I will not pay a dime out of pocket and will have a generous maternity leave.

My problem is that had I known the amount of responsibility/stress I would be taking on, I would not have accepted their counter-offer of $45k/year + some RSUs, no yearly bonuses. Even leaving it at $50k doesn't compensate for the change in responsibility. 

**My plan was to tell my immediate manager that I would not have accepted the counter-offer for $45k had I known what the job would entail, it was not properly communicated and I feel we should use $50k as a starting point for my salary review.** Is this too aggressive? I don't have a frame of reference for whether this is appropriate. This will be my first salary review as a full time employee, and the first time my manager(who used to be my team leader) will be the one reviewing. The previous salary was negotiated with someone else. This manager has a very clear picture of my work and accomplishments, but still I will be able to list at least 20 ways that I have made a huge impact on our team's success over the last year.

I just got a job offer as an Operations Manager at a large manufacturing facility. I'll be moving back home and the employer is a one hour drive each way.  


The facility operates in three shifts, and I'll probably be getting the unfavorable 12:00 AM to 9:00 AM shift. Yeah, the hours are crazy, but the money is good, $65,000/year. I'm not sure if I should take it though as it honestly doesn't seem very interesting to me. I was hoping I could take the job and look for another job while I'm working so I can make some money and gain some experience. Would it be unethical to take this job, even though I know I'll quit the moment something better pops up? Or should I ride it out for a year or two and then start looking at other places?  


I'm really torn as to what I should do. My GPA isn't the greatest (2.63), so I don't think a lot of employers would be too interested in me.  But I do have good work experience, including an internship at a top-tier medical company. I'm scared I'll be jobless for a long time if I don't take the offer.

I've applied to some positions posted on internships.com and internmatch.com, and almost every position asks for links to my best work.

Anyways, there was NO WAY possible I was going to test positive for that but all I could think about was how I was going to get kicked out of this internship and I would be stuck in this city and the lease I signed.... Man those 5 days before hearing I passed the test were the most anxious I've ever been in my life.

1eqtg2,9,2013-05-21,Help.,MRN1982,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1eqtg2/help/,"I am a 30 year old man that is happily married with a beautiful, loving wife and have a 6 week old baby. I haven't been working for over 3 years. I became a firefighter when I was 21 because I like to help people. I worked hard and pursued my dream and attained it. On the advice of my retiring captain I attended paramedic school to better myself. In order to do this I would have to take one year off in order to attend classes and 800 hours of an internship. Over 1200 hours of work in total. My internship lasted 600 hours, a far greater time than is normal. My preceptor, normally a hard ass (but an amazing preceptor and paramedic) with a 60% fail rate kept me on and gave me as much extra time as he could. He saw how hard I applied myself, how hard I studied and applied what he taught, however, I still was unable to make the cut. I had folded under the pressure of a few bad calls. He told me that failing me was the hardest thing that he had ever done with any intern he had. I will always remember his kindness mixed with disappointment.  After I had failed. I tried to return back to my fire career. My old captain had retired out of the country. The captain who replaced him a deeply conservative, homophobic, and mean spirited man blocked any attempt for me to rejoin the department. He had tried to terminate a young lesbian woman who worked at our station the previous year and my testimony cast doubt upon what happened. Every other firefighter had said ""I didn't see anything."" I told the truth and her job was saved and subsequently transferred.  I also had transferred to another shift with the retiring captain. After failing paramedic school, and not being able to get back in to the job I love. I have been lost ever since. I decided to work on an ambulance and was employed for 2 1/2 years. Due to depression and a back injury I could no longer work for them. 

It has been 3 years. My muscular and athletic body has turned to fat and  I am now an embarrassing 310lbs. I am unemployed and have tried to find other careers but nothing has been able to stick. I have only a high school diploma and was never very good at school. My wife is a very successful business woman who's career has skyrocketed. She will be graduating from a top 5 university with a MBA. I am ashamed to stand beside her when we are with friends. I have seen therapists for depression. I had started experimenting with drugs for a short time behind her back. She never found out. When she got pregnant I stopped.  Now I just sit in front of the computer for an average of 12 hours a day playing video games, just happy to get lost in them. My wife's irritation and exasperation has been growing. She says I have the power to change anything I just have to put my mind to it. This makes me feel even more weak and powerless. I try to avoid looking at myself in the mirror and every day feel a mix of shame and self loathing fill my chest. I was bullied most of my time in school. I am a 30 year old man, but I feel the same familiar helplessness as I did when I was younger. I feel myself sinking, and see no ways to fix it. I feel as if I am dragging my loved ones down with me. I sometimes think that my child would be better off without having my influence in her life and that my wife could find a better man after I am gone.  These thoughts of suicide are not the first I have had. I have battled with them ever since I was a teenager. They went away when I had my dream job, I had the drive and the fire to improve myself and had become living proof that nerds to become great after school. Now I am back full circle. The shame, embarrassment, and feelings of worthlessness have come flooding back, this time however, they are much stronger. I sit in front of my computer and cry when I am home alone. When I am out running errands I fantasize about being murdered during a robbery or run over by a careless driver. Having worked in the Emergency medical field I know what happens to people who say they are a threat to themselves and others. When I started planning to jump off a bridge while her family was here to visit (so she could have support nearby) I decided to post here. 

I have been to the top. Since then I have lost so much. My career, health, faith, and soon my family if things don't change. "

1eqrc4,2,2013-05-20,I'm planning to propose an entrepreneurial alternative to the co-op program at my university. I would appreciate some experienced advice on the subject.,7RED7,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1eqrc4/im_planning_to_propose_an_entrepreneurial/,"My university has a solid department dedicated to helping students get work experience through internships and co-ops, but there is currently no internal support (that I've been able to find) for starting a business in the same manner. One of the main advantages of a co-op program is that a student can dedicate their full attention to working at a company for a semester while maintaining their status as a full-time student (financial aid, and other continual study requirements are not affected as the student has ""full-time"" status while only paying for 1 credit hour).

I want to set up a system that can provide students with the same benefits as a co-op program, but instead of going to work in the field of their major (under the guidance of an industry veteran) they could be working to start a business under the mentorship of an experienced entrepreneur (which we do have in both the engineering and business schools here). The mentor could set up specific milestones tailored for the startup in order for the student to succeed and evaluate their performance while providing feedback.

What are some things I should be considering here?"

The last month has been so hectic, going through an unexpected breakup, the death of the family member who supported me most in my transition, severe stress with regards to finding an internship for the summer and passing my classes (did both thankfully), and figuring out when/how to come out as full-time. Yesterday I had a trans woman I don't know that well beg me to save her life, as she was kicked out of her friends house and wanted to die. I got her to a hospital after a few hours of panicking and not knowing what to do, and as far as I know she's safe. Some of the most nerve wracking four hours of my life, not knowing what the fuck to do. Thankfully my mom helped me in that situation, even though she disapproves of my life choices to transition.

I'm so stressed out from all these stressors that I don't know how to cope at this point. That was too much, and too real. I'm so depressed/borderline/who knows at this point, and I know some of it has to do with not being full time even at 16 months of HRT because my mom disapproves. But I'm scared shitless to go full-time at the disapproval of my mother and facing all my classmates my last year or two of college as a girl after being a boy.

Too much stress, too little joy, I don't know anymore. I'm desperate. Sometimes I wonder if my unhappiness is just me being a little bitch about things, and I just need to force myself to be happy."
1eqlqv,18,2013-05-20,My mother...,smarmodon,SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1eqlqv/my_mother/,"1) So I'm in college and  I have my first ever real-person job this summer. Okay, it's an internship, and it doesn't pay, but I'm going to be doing something I am passionate about that will help me get a paying job in my chosen field eventually... hopefully. The fact that it doesn't pay means I'd have to take a second job at like a McDonalds or something, which will suck but I gotta pay rent! So I'll be working 50-60 hours a week.

2) Also, I come from a very wealthy family, which means that during the school year I am entirely financially dependent on them. My parents pay my tuition and give me spending money. (I'd get a job but it's impossible on my campus if you're not work/study which I don't qualify for.) I totally understand that this is a really privileged position and I am very grateful for the fact that my parents support me and that I won't have to graduate with any debt.

3) Thirdly, over spring break I chose to go on a vacation with my boyfriend's family instead of staying at home with mine. I did it because I wanted to meet some of his extended family and get to know his parents better. I would not have done it if my family had plans, but they didn't because my brother didn't have a break. So I didn't spend much time at home over last break.

With all of those things in mind, here's the real issue. My parents are trying to plan a vacation this summer. We usually go somewhere really far away for at least 10 days. But I only have a week between the end of my internship and school's start date. I also have plans the weekend after my internship that can't be moved because it's for a fixed event. So I really have 5 days for a vacation. Which apparently means I can't go on any family vacation, although I tried suggesting a long weekend or short vacation just to a local beach or something. But apparently we just have to go to the Galapogos or Alaska or SE Asia or something far away and long.

My mother is guilting the crap out of me over this. ""Oh is it that you love [SO's mom] more than us? I'm really hurt that you chose to go on vacation with her but not us!"" ""We never get to see you!"" and more. She wants me to ask my boss for vacation time but I don't feel comfortable doing that, because it is only a 3 month internship and who takes a vacation on that? In addition I'd have to get time off for two jobs which means I might not be able to swing my budget for that month... it just seems very complicated.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to go on vacation with my family, but circumstances may make it impossible for me to do so. And my mother is furious over this. She's very manipulative and can get quite nasty when she wants to. Usually when she gets mad enough at me she threatens to stop paying my tuition or giving me spending money (which I mostly use for essentials, it's not like I go skydiving with it or anything). I kind of want to tell her that her little baby is growing up and that I simply cannot swing a vacation this summer, but she would probably do that icy ""I'm not speaking to you until you give me what I want"" thing and maybe take away my spending money/freeze my checking acct which is technically under her name. She hasn't done it before but I would not put it past her if she gets mad enough.

I realize this is such a privileged little baby problem but I honestly am just so confused and I don't know who to ask about it. So my question is how do I deal with this situation and should I even bother confronting my mom? This whole ""control"" situation has been bubbling for a while now just below the surface and I have to deal with it eventually. My plan is to call my dad at work tomorrow and make sure he'd be okay with giving me spending money if I didn't go on vacation with them, and then call my mom and tell her that I can't go and sorry but I really need to focus on my future right now."
1eqljd,6,2013-05-20,Is (steel) reinforced concrete the ideal material for structural construction?,deepthoughts1,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/1eqljd/is_steel_reinforced_concrete_the_ideal_material/,"Hello all,

I'm currently an intern at an apartment construction site in Korea (I don't particularly do anything, but I'm here to learn over the summer). I talk to my mentor daily and one day he told me if I came up with faster and more efficient way that could replace the reinforced concrete, I'd make enough money to retire at any moment. I know it sounds silly and asked other workers when I realized I couldn't come up with one. 

One of the workers told me that the reason why we use the same construction method in Korea since 1970s, is because we haven't found better methods. Now, I'm not sure how the construction is in other countries, but he said the reinforced concrete is the 'ideal' even in this modern world. He then explained to me why...blah blah

Long story short, reinforced concrete is known to be the ideal when in comes to structural construction. Other methods are known to be expensive. Can there be any other way?"

Midway through April I was tentatively offered a choice of two positions—one would be as a daily operations consultant at a major buy-side fund, and the other is a post-M&amp;A operations restructuring role that would start in several months. I expressed hesitation about the travel that was involved with these positions, especially the restructuring option. I'm in a serious relationship, plan on getting married in several months, and don't want to spend the first few years of that away from my future spouse for 6+ weeks at a time. 

I have also been pursuing an equity research role at a boutique investment bank, and was offered an internship position that would likely allow me to transition to full-time in 2-3 months. Recently, my contact at the consulting gig desired setting up a meet-and-greet informational interview with his entry-level employees to help me make a decision between the two positions he offered me. I accepted the ER position earlier today because it's aligned with something I actually want to do, but I'm not sure how to turn down my contact at the consulting job. Given the longer-running nature of our relationship, I'd like to part on good terms. Is there a good way of going about this? He's invested some of his time in me and expressed considerable interest in bringing me on at his firm. What should I do?

At the moment I really didn't know where else to turn.  My parents would silently judge me and are relatively impossible people when it comes to emotional support.  Yes, I have friends, and yes, they will/do support me - but that's not necessarily the point at the moment.  
Also, keep in mind, I didn't come here for any information I could have found on the first few pages of Google - I'm well aware of most of the information. 

I'm 19 years old and I have been drinking for roughly 2 and a half years, roughly 3 times a week, moderately-heavily.  
To say this brings much judgment, so I feel the need to also toot my own horn - mostly with the fact that I hold a job that I work 20 hours a week at, have an internship where I perform neuropsych evaluations on clients for 15 hours a week, attend a University with a 3.7 GPA, have very few enemies, and am a group facilitator volunteer at a child grief center.  
La-dee-da. 
Anyways, as I said, I'm not looking for someone to Google this, I was looking for other people's stories of withdrawal as a form of support for me.  The last few weeks I have had difficulty sleeping without drinking - as of last week I started to sweat bullets in my sleep, when I slept, which was difficult as it was. 
Because of my age and the way my parents (aka way to get any real medical help) are, I do not see in-patient or out-patient care being an option (AT THIS TIME).  
This is now 4 days sober.  While working I experience minimal withdrawal symptoms, although I sweat much more.  I keep hydrated as much as possible, and have found no current signs of dehydration.  
Along with the sweating, it has been very difficult to fall asleep.  The last 2 days have been relatively easier to do so, but I do wake up at least twice in the night to drink water.  
Also, beginning yesterday, I seem to have very small bouts of ""being out of it"".  I would label disorientation to be as close to the feeling as I get, but it is just moments of it and haven't affected my life by any means (as I hear symptoms seem to be worst around 3-5 days after your last drinking session).  
I came here because I wanted to know how long it actually takes to have a good nights sleep again, along with other stories of those that have struggled with withdrawal.  I am ADAMANT in not drinking until well after these effects cease, and because I find myself to be a bit knowledgeable of what's actually happening to my body, I find that I'm able to trudge through it in a relatively safe way.

By job shadowing someone in the company you want to work for, not only do you see how day to day work is at this place, but you get to know someone in the company and possibly get introduced to higher-ups. It gets you connected before you even apply, and possibly even recommended. If anything it will only help you."

I'm anxious about submitting my resume and interviewing since I don't really have a good explanation for the last semester.

Last bit before my question, I'll have about a month before the position starts that I could devote to learning Php - however that would be well after the application deadline.

1ev20s,6,2013-05-22,My [21F] (wannabe) boss[32M] is driving me crazy!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ev20s/my_21f_wannabe_boss32m_is_driving_me_crazy/,"I've been volunteer interning at the Texas State Capitol for the 2013 session for the Rep that represents my hometown. It started in January 2013, but due to the suffering from horrible allergies, I didn't actually start until February 2013.

I work in a state representative's office and his chief-of-staff is driving me crazy for a few reasons. 

First, because he began to hit on me. I have a... curvaceous bottom and he's made several comments about it. I didn't really make a big deal about it at first, but I just got progressively more uncomfortable. He'd say that when I step right, it goes left. I chose to ignore it. I got a boyfriend mid-March and I've been pretty vocal about it with the other girls at the office so I know he knows. After he found out I was in a relationship, he stopped making those comments.

Second, I've been trying to lose some weight this spring. I'm nowhere near fat, but I'd like to lose about 10 pounds. He's made comments about my weight and sometimes I'll cheat on my diet and he would say, ""aren't you supposed to be eating clean?"" Just constant ridicule of my body. I'm also Facebook friends with the representative I work for and I know his chief-of-staff runs it. I'll post my meals on Instagram and link it to my Facebook and he has said things like, ""brown rice and corn isn't eating clean,"" in a really condescending way. Again, I chose to ignore it. 

Lastly, I was sick for almost two weeks last month and I had to call in for about 6 work days. I haven't had anything to do in the office since March and I don't get paid to do this job, so I figured calling in wouldn't be such a big deal. BIG MISTAKE. He's basically forced me to be the only intern in the office since after the school semester ended (I'm an undergrad student at UT Austin) without anything to do. I spend my time at the office being on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit. Finally a few days ago I went to him and said, ""do you need me to do anything? I'm really bored."" His response: ""You're the only intern who took almost two weeks off from work. You claimed you were sick. We have constituents from the rep's district call everyday and can easily say 'we saw one of your staffers out and about today,' which I know is a total lie because I was NEVER out an about in the district. So basically I'm being forced to twiddle my thumbs at work.

He's always making shitty comments around me while in front of me. For instance, our legislative director and him were talking and our legislative director said, ""that means our interns have to come in this weekend, right?"" and he goes, ""well I know TG (another intern's initials) is down,"" basically saying that I won't do what's asked of me. WHAT THE HELL? I have never indicated I would not come in if needed to. I'm just so tired of being treated inappropriately and thought as of being lazy.

So r/relationship, what do I do? Session ends in a week, but I plan on putting this job on my resume and I'm so scared that a future potential employer will call him and he'll say all these horrible things about me. Advice? 

TL;DR my (wannabe) boss has made sexual comments to me, made comments about my weight and made comments about me being lazy, which is absolutely not true. Help? "

1ev013,4,2013-05-22,"Unhappy with B.S., failed a year, low GPA, did internship at Google. Should I pursue Masters?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ev013/unhappy_with_bs_failed_a_year_low_gpa_did/,"I'm studying CS at a little known university in Europe and just finishing B.S. Didn't like it very much so far - I failed a year and have really low GPA - 2.0/4.0 (US scale). However, I also did 4 software engineering internships at good companies (one of them is Google) so my resume is not that bad.

Here is how I passed most courses:

* Skipped all classes - they are a waste of time.

* Watched equivalent courses at Coursera, MIT OCW or something similar.

* Downloaded good books rather than read those written by local professors.

Really, why bother going to a university if I am learning everything on my own? Yeah, I do have friends. Yes, I am exposed many areas of CS. Yes, I can study on my own. Yes, I do a lot of programming in my free time. What am I missing here?

However, I must also say that some courses at my university are excellent. But still, just a minority. And I would go through them by myself anyway - all materials are available to me. Apart from writing a thesis, I feel there is really no point in being enrolled.

Two more years pursuing Masters doesn't sound exciting to me - I'd rather work for a year and then study on my own for a year or two. The fact that my salary might be compromised at some point in the future is worrying me. Is this my concern valid? Would it matter if I get a job in U.S.? What about Europe?

Do you believe me when I say that online courses blow equivalent courses at my university out of the water? Do I sound silly? Anyone else feeling like this?

What would you advise me to do - Masters or not?"

She's great - funny, smart, active, cute, etc. She finished the internship and left at the end of the summer (about 9 months ago). 

We don't keep in touch that much, but every once in a while we'll ping each other on facebook. She invited me to her party, I liked some picture of her getting an award, she liked a several months old profile picture, etc. 

Is it weird or inappropriate to ask her out? She used to work for me, so I don't want to cross any boundaries. But she doesn't work for me anymore, and I'm not going to be at the same company for long in any event. Still, I haven't even seen this girl in since I dunno, September? Would this be some creepy or some unspoken violation of etiquette?

Oh another thing I don't love is that I'd have to ask her out via facebook - the only other way to contact her would be to pull her old work file and grab her cell from her resume, but I'm fairly positive this would come across as weird and be badly received. Anyway, thoughts or comments appreciated. "

[If the Xbox One red rings, will it be the One Ring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3ywl8?context=5)|Not a ring to be found on the Xbox One! Clever Microsoft.
[Do you know how much of the 8gb DDR3 memory will be used for gaming, and how that compares to the PS4's 8gb of GDRR5 memory?  People who live outside the US will know how late we got access to Netflix, many still don't have it, and we still don't get many of the entertainment services. To us, the 360 only had half the functionality they advertized in the US. But it was alright, because 360 was still mostly a game console, so you got what you payed for.  But the Xbox One seems to be a 50% TV-box and 50% game console, especially given the rumors saying half the memory is locked for gaming. So unless the TV and entertainment features are supported outside US, we're paying full prize for half the product.  Do you know anything about this? Will the sport features work in Europe? Will the DVR and TV functionality work for our brands? What is their strategy for Europeans, if they have any at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3wzhl?context=5)|Microsoft didn't specify how much is allocated for gaming. As for the comparative benefits, it's hard to say because each system uses the hardware differently.  Despite the emphasis on entertainment &amp; TV yesterday, I have no doubts that the Xbox One will be a robust gaming platform and based on all of the conversations I've had, it sounds like the company is aggressively pushing for exclusives and launch content from devs. As for the TV rollout, Microsoft hasn't specified their timeline, but it shouldn't be difficult to implement with European boxes.
[Scott, it's Max Scoville from Rev3Games. Quick question: when you take off your glasses, do you look like Michael Keaton? Because I was watching Jackie Brown and Michael Keaton would totally look like you if he put on your glasses.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3wxnm?context=5)|I never take my glasses off. But if I did, I'd almost certainly look like Michael Keaton.
[Do you feel like the pitchforks that the internet seems to be raising is justified or just fear/hate-mongering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xonn?context=5)|Justified. Microsoft left a lot of critical questions unanswered and sent all sorts of mixed messages.
[How much do you know about the integration of the kinect?  Will it be easy to disable?  Will it be necessary to use the kinect to navigate the UI? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3y06c?context=5)|The Kinect must be connected, but nothing in Microsoft's language made me believe that you'd be required to use it for menu navigation.
[If you were in charge of the development of the Xbox one, what direction would you have taken? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3y361?context=5)|I think they have the right idea in terms of building the ""everything box,"" but how they chose to introduce it to the world was...lacking.
[From what you've seen, can you put a price on it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3x1n2?context=5)|I'd guess $500 - $600, unless they go the 2-year Xbox Live subscription subsidized model route.
[Knowing that a Kinect is required for the Xbox One to operate, will tampering with it render the console unusable? ie. taping up the camera and microphone so it doesn't see my ""O"" face.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xxl1?context=5)|Not to my knowledge. It seems optional for most applications.
[What are you personally excited about that they showed off?  What do you hope they show off later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3y02s?context=5)|I'm actually really excited for Kinect. Not trolling. It's the powerful, precise sensor/console combo it should have been. I'm not really all that excited for Kinect games, per se, but rather how it's used to COMPLEMENT existing games.
[The Xbox One itself looks huge, how big is it compared to other consoles like the 360?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xoin?context=5)|About the same size as the original 360. Boxier and thicker, but rough estimate is about the same footprint.
[Were you surprised that microsoft named their new console the Xbox One? Do you agree this with this name or prefer Xbox Infinity, or even Durango? Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xov3?context=5)|I would have preferred it to simply be ""Xbox"" or ""the new Xbox"" — One works, but it's completely unnecessary.
[Hey guys.  Microsoft has touted the 1:1 fidelity of the new Kinect and its apparent absence of lag (as reported even by you Mitch on your site\)  How much truth is there to these statements? Will we be seeing true 1:1 representation of our movements within games? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3ya9p?context=5)|As far as we saw (a 15 minute demo of the sensor tech), there was no lag. That said, the experience could very well change when it's built into a real game. We'll have to wait and see.
[Did you have a bunch of Microsoft employees follow you around and applaud every two minutes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3x6m4?context=5)|No, but that would have been a nice self-esteem booster.
[I have read that the controller is supposed to have improved sensitivity and mechanisms as well as it being more ergonomic. The picture of it looks almost identical to the last gen with small design changes to the exterior. Was there a noticeable difference?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3wyej?context=5)|Unfortunately, Microsoft was focusing largely on the new impulse triggers (the rumble feedback in the triggers of the new controller), which only really included rudimentary tech demoes of how the motors worked.
[Any idea of how badly this would affect the price of the controllers?  Rumour has it a new controller was listed on Amazon yesterday for around $90 each for pre-order. That seems kinda ridiculous. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3ysas?context=5)|I doubt the impulse triggers would increase the cost drastically. I'm more curious about the new data port on the bottom.
[Has there been any discussion on pricing theories for this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca40lum?context=5)|Not yet. It'll be easier to guess once we know how much new games cost.
[Anyword on Illumiroom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3wvt1?context=5)|I'm skeptical that it will become a consumer-level product...anytime soon. It's certain to be a pricey add-on and Microsoft is more likely to focus on shipping the Xbox One itself.
[What do you think about the fact that the Xbox One is not backwards compatible with Xbox 360 games? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3wrv2?context=5)|Adding backwards compatibility wouldn't have just been difficult, it would have been costly. And honestly, I've never understood the appeal of backwards compatibility for games. I still own last-gen systems, why do I need it in the current box (and subsequently pay more for it)?
[Nintendo Wii won precisely because it didn't focus on hardcore gamers.  Serious gamers are now complaining that XboxOne focuses too much on entertainment while PS4 is for serious gamers.  XboxOne could manage to attract a Wii size audience with entertainment options while also attracting plenty of serious gamers with both cross-platform and exclusive games.  If that's the case, and it makes the most total consumers happy (while making a profit\), do hardcore gamers really matter?  If Microsoft loses a couple million ""hardcore gamers"" (who constantly complain\) to pick up 5 times as many casual consumers, why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xwb3?context=5)|I couldn't agree more. And TBH, I think that's a scenario where everyone wins, because the Xbox platform will continue to grow, whereas the hardcore audience otherwise wouldn't have been enough to sustain it.
[The One's reveal was underwhelming and the snippets of games we did see looked like rendered footage. How do you think the X1 will do against the PS4? When we saw the PS4 we saw gameplay and in game footage from Shadow Fall and Deep Down. Do you two think the X1 will be able to step it up by E3?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xjq0?context=5)|I think it was a conscious decision by Microsoft to keep games focus as limited as possible in order to make a bigger splash at E3. That's also why they didn't discuss the exact GPU specs, I'm guessing. If they don't make a big deal about the processor and its monster performance at E3, real or exaggerated, at E3, I'd be very surprised.
[How big is the new Xbox compared to the 360?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xcua?context=5)|It's comparable to the original Xbox 360, albeit thicker and boxier.
[Will you be answering questions in this AMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3ybax?context=5)|Nope.
[The comments on IGN and around the internet regarding the Xbox One press event have been very negative. (Especially due to the fact that Microsoft seems more worried about creating an entertainment hub than it does about creating games.\) Where you able to speak to the Microsoft reps about this, and if so, what did they say? Also, what is your opinion regarding this negativity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3y9ra?context=5)|Honestly, we were so wrapped up in the on-site tours, interviews, and demos that we weren't able to see the feedback until late in the evening. I'm guessing it was the same for much of the on-site staff.
[Hello IGN team, watched most of you're Stream at my house, made an event out of it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xt82?context=5)|I remember the Novint Falcon fondly! I think I still have one...somewhere.
[The Xbox One is obviously a very interesting piece of hardware that does a lot of ""innovative"" things as a media hub. This idea of the Xbox being a media hub is no new concept as it is what Microsoft claimed they wanted for the Xbox from the get go. With this new hardware they are now able to reach this goal. with what we have seen this easily can be ""the one"" box in your living room.  From a gaming perspective however a lot of us could feel betrayed in a way. The gamers are the ones who made the Xbox what it is and now they don't care about us. Obviously this is an overreaction as I am sure we will hear all about the gaming side of this machine at E3 but from what we have heard now it seems like their main push is going to be the media hub idea. What I feel this does is it makes comparing the three consoles almost like comparing apples to oranges as they are all targeting very different markets.  My question to you is do you feel this is true and if so what will do you feel it will do to ""the console wars"" and do you think we will see a large separation in demographics of who buys which console?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xi2e?context=5)|As much as it may not appeal to gamers, I think the focus on entertainment is going to be critical to Microsoft's long-term success, but I don't think they're abandoning gamers. Poorly executed as it was, I do think Microsoft's intent was to focus on introducing the platform this week and dig deep into games at E3.
[Do you prefer white bread or brown bread?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3yf45?context=5)|I like to think we live in a world where both can coexist deliciously.
[How will they use Smartglass any more than a novelty? Are they going to develop smartglass applications for specific games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xqh7?context=5)|I think cross-device integration and mobile are going to be pillars of MS' longterm strategy. Start your game on your Xbox, continue on your PC, tablet, or smartphone.
[Do you think it was smart for Sony to wait on showing their console?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xy7f?context=5)|Hard to say. On the one hand, it made a strong statement to gamers, but on the other, they now have to spend more time at E3 talking about hardware and not games.

During: Excited yet frantic (it was an incredibly short presentation, considering) After: Confused.
[1.\) As a handicapped game with limited movement of my hands, I find it hard to use some controllers and play certain games due to the button layouts. The Dualshock 3 and using R1 to shoot is the easiest for me personally, where as the XBox 360 controller triggers are hard to press due to the curved triggers. How big is the new controller compared to the XBox 360 and Dualshock 3? Is the distance between the right joystick and the right trigger comparable to last generations controllers?  2.\) Did anyone at Microsoft give you an impression that their press conference at E3 was going to be more game centric than yesterdays presser? I'm partly concerned due to the lack of software talk, especially exclusives.  3.\) Who's reveal impressed you more, PS4 or Xbox One? What do you guys think Sony needs to do to win some of the mindshare back from consumers?  4.\) Sony and Microsoft seem to have differing strategies so far and are approaching the next generation of game consoles in a different way. Which approach do you think is best for the next 5-10 years of console gaming: The do everything living room entertainment box (Microsoft\), or the hardcore gaming platform that focuses on software and social interactions within the software?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3ycf2?context=5)|The controller is roughly the same size as the 360 and the layout/positioning is identical as far as I could tell. Microsoft reps told us they didn't want ot mess with the formula too much.  Absolutely. We pressed them at every turn with that criticism and they reassured that E3 would be, and had always been, the event where they focus on games.  I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I'm hungry for games and Microsoft completely underdelivered, but I'm also a hardware nerd and Sony didn't show any. I think Sony's biggest opportunity is the aggressive anti-DRM stance.
[When it comes to consoles, one of the biggest (yet often overlooked\) functional requirements is a controller that you can comfortably hold for hours. Ergonomics in mind, do you have any notes on the controller? Is it nicer to play with than the 360 controller? What about it's functionality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xci2?context=5)|Our demo was brief and didn't include gameplay, sadly. That said, it felt very similar to the Xbox 360 controller.
[*didn't include gameplay.*  Neither did the reveal. No big surprise there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3zu4e?context=5)|ZING!
[Is it as horrible as everyone says it is? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3wrrr?context=5)|No. People are frustrated, and with good reason. But I think in the end, people will really dig the One.
[Was it as easy to use as it looked when demonstrated via voice control?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3y5jl?context=5)|Voice control wasn't included in our hands-on demo, sadly. But the motion tracking was incredible!
[With the only clear advantage to Xbox One being the Kinect, do you think Sony has anything up their sleeves with the  new PS Eye?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3wyb3?context=5)|Hard to say. Sony made the new Eye a very minor part of their announcement in Feb. E3 we'll know more!
[How did you get your start in this industry? What did you guys go to school for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3y23h?context=5)|I studied journalism and got my start as an intern.
[Has the microphone jack been removed for the XBONE controller? Do you think they'll be pushing Bluetooth headsets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3x3bd?context=5)|The port on the bottom of the controller is now a proprietary data connector. My gut says that there will be a headset, but the bigger push will be to use the Kinect's new and improved voice detection and noise-cancellation features.
[What is your favorite movie and why is it die hard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3ys42?context=5)|Die Hard with a dash of Point Break.
[What were your thoughts on the kinect revamp? Pros and cons? Awesome that you guys are doing this! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3y6ho?context=5)|Pro: what Kinect 1.0 should have been. Precise. Versatile. Effective. Cons: Bigger, mandatory.
[How long do you think Microsoft will continue to make Xbox 360 games after the release of Xbox one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3xxqp?context=5)|The Xbox 360 install base is so large, it'd be crazy for them to abandon it within the next two or three years. Like previous generations, development will slowly shrink, but some form of support is certain to continue...especially if the 360 becomes Microsoft's low-cost entertainment box.
[What has taken the place of the Start and Back buttons, and is the Xbox logo at the top of the controller still the guide button?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3zxqp?context=5)|Microsoft REFUSED to commit to anything WRT to the buttons, oddly. The Xbox button is still the dash/guide button, but start/back are now branded with what appears to be the multitasking button and a contextual menu button (i.e. in-game menu button).
[Best: Kinect rules and it works.  Worst: Nobody at Microsoft knows what to say about used games and DRM, so they just say whatever they want regardless of truth!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3yrsh?context=5)|+1.
[You have to remember these guys are with IGN, and IGN isn't above taking money and having one of their workers appear in a video game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3zsmm?context=5)|I see what you did there!
 |But no, IGN doesn't take money for positive coverage. Or money from publishers outside of traditional advertising and sponsored campaigns, and all of that is handled by a separate sales team.
 |Chobot's appearance in ME3 was not associated with IGN in any way. It was news to most (if not all) of us when it was announced.
[Technically speaking, PS3's problem was that it launched at $500/600 while the 360 was at $300/400 and the Wii was $250. If both PS4 and X1 launch at $500-600, neither one will be at a disadvantage against the other due to price.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3zk2z?context=5)|Pricing is going to be a late announcement, I'm guessing. If one goes early, the other can use the time to undercut it.
[It's decidedly unsexy, I think. It looks like a VCR.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3ywj7?context=5)|Agreed. My understanding was that this design was done in-house, whereas the original Xbox 360 was a third-party. And Microsoft's in-house hardware ID is very boring.
[Embrace the bone... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca404uo?context=5)|Xbone makes my eye twitch. People need to cut that out.
[Did you guys share a room and bed. :}](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3yhos?context=5)|According to trusted sources, Mitch sounds like a congested pug when he sleeps.
[Because they didn't specify DDR5, I'll bet my arm it's DDR3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eunc2/were_scott_mitch_from_ign_and_we_spent_the_day/ca3yx7r?context=5)|Since I pine over these things, the RAM is DDR3.

1eux9b,3,2013-05-22,Opinions on possible future career paths,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1eux9b/opinions_on_possible_future_career_paths/,"First, a little background about me:

I am currently a Junior at a midsize regional school in Missouri as an Accounting major, with minors in Math and Computer Science. I work on the campus as an Application Developer, and have performed a project management internship with a local manufacturing company. I am projected to be graduating with a 3.75 GPA, with Honors. I could bring up my GPA by retaking courses I received a B in, but would prefer not to do that unless I have to. I have not yet taken the GMAT, but I did receive a 160/160/5 (verbal/quant/analytical writing) on the new GRE without study, so I feel like studying for a month or two for the GMAT will enable me to get a decent score (according to [this tool](https://www.ets.org/gre/institutions/about/mba/comparison_tool), those scores translate to approximately a 670 without studying). I have had an internship with a mid-size regional firm in St. Louis in IT Audit, and will likely receive an offer of employment from them, if I do not make it into the Big 4. 

Ultimately, I would love to get a PhD in Accountancy with a focus on InfoSys or Fraud to conduct research and teach, and gaining direct admission to a PhD program from undergraduate study would be absolutely ideal. However, it seems the Accounting PhD field is rather competitive, with average entrance requirements hovering around the 90th percentile mark and a very low number of available seats. Compound that with competition from people with several years of work experience, and it is likely that I will not get directly admitted to a PhD program. 

I am considering working full-time for several years, while taking UCONN's online MSA program at my leisure to hopefully bolster my resume while I am also earning my CPA and CISA certifications. I am also considering trying instead get into a top Masters program, forego the work at the CPA firm, and try to enter PhD study instead with a masters from a top university (UIUC, Wharton, Ross, Booth, etc, provided I can gain entry). Assuming I cannot gain direct entry into a PhD program, which route sounds the most attractive, and why?"

But how should one actually go out and find available jobs or internships?
1euvtt,3,2013-05-22,Been going back and forth on this decision a long time. Today was the last straw and I'm definitely doing it. Is there a convenient way to end it all?,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1euvtt/been_going_back_and_forth_on_this_decision_a_long/,"Background: Was huge into biochem in high school. Have done research in malaria, cancer, and kidney disease at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, and at the Department of Medicine in my current University, respectively. I was really good at it, and went to Intel ISEF as well as Intel STS winning awards at both for my research. I was going to be premed with a biochem major at my current university, then after my first year decided to pursue a business major, as I thoroughly enjoyed the entrepreneurship, finance and accounting classes I was taking. I hated the economics classes I was taking, which would count towards an economics major (important later in the discussion). At my university, we have one of the top undergraduate business schools, but you have to apply to get in even after your application the university. This is a two-year undergraduate business program for the third and fourth years at the university.

My application was deferred first round, and then I was rejected today. I had to choose another major so I chose CS. I didn't score high enough in my econ classes to select a second major in economics. Now I won't have the opportunity to pursue finance, unless I apply to my university's fifth year masters in commerce program.

I feel like a huge failure. I've disappointed my parents, stressed myself out to the point where I am sick and have tried everything but cannot relax, will be doing an internship in finance this summer that won't help with my degree, my GPA is in the dumps (3.134), and I've completely lost track of my life, putting on a significant amount of weight, and being unable to make friends. I feel like my life has gone downhill since I switched majors, and I don't have anyone who understands me academically who can advise me. I've been restless for the past two years of my life (currently just finished second year of uni) and it seems like there is no end in sight. I'm losing hair because of stress, I can't digest food, and I have nobody to talk to.

I can't pursue the field I am interested in since the business major is not offered outside of the business school. When everyone around me is being so successful and being congratulated on major internships, on admissions to the business school, and making loads of money, here I am complaining to reddit. Clearly my life has become so extremely pathetic. I do not deserve to live. I do not deserve the opportunities my parents have given me by paying for my college tuition. I do not deserve friends or girlfriends. I do not deserve any sort of confidence (which is probably the reason I have none). The only thing that has kept me from committing suicide in the past couple of years has been what my parents will think of me. But now I already know they're disappointed in me, and nothing will change that. I don't deserve my amazing parents and family. I have never gone to a college party or been invited by anyone anywhere. I've never had a friend, never been wanted, and I've always been working or on Reddit. Now I have even less of a reason to want to go to a party or experience college life. I don't deserve the clothes I wear. I don't deserve the food I eat. I don't deserve the space I take up. I don't deserve the air I breathe. I don't deserve life.

That's my situation, and I think I'm either immature or mature enough to know that I'm a lost cause. Please advise on how to end my life so as to have the least impact on my family.

Thank you."

Looking for an internship...,[deleted],orangecounty,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1eurvd/anyone_in_the_restaurant_industry_looking_for_an/,"Hey. So, I am 3 classes and one internship away from getting my Bachelor's in Culinary Arts Management. The degree will be from UNLV, but I'm presently in Orange County and this is where I need to get the internship.
Basically, I need to work 200 hours at a restaurant. I'm supposed to work in just about every area in FOH and BOH, as well as do a bit of management shadowing. Additionally, according to the professor in charge of the program...it has to be paid. I'm assuming that this is to prevent us getting taken advantage of? I definitely like $$, but I know that this is going to be a deterrent and isn't what people typically think when they hear ""internship"".

I'm definitely organized/a problem solver/good at customer service, and while I don't cook much these days (I'll get back into it when I have someone worth cooking for), I have a lot of the basic skills and am a quick learner. And I'm kinda funny.

I have a full-time job, but could work after 6 on week days and at any time on the weekends.

I know this is a long shot, but maybe Reddit can pull through?"
1eurmr,70,2013-05-22,I've identified my problem -- I'm a boredom eater,Langlie,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1eurmr/ive_identified_my_problem_im_a_boredom_eater/,"They say the first step to recovery is identifying that you have a problem. Well I've finally figured out what that is. I eat because I am absolutely completely bored. When I'm busy with college and going out with people, I'm pretty good about my calorie counting. But when I start to settle into a routine, I find myself filling my time by walking to the local Chipotle or grocery store and buying crap. All my favorite hobbies involve sitting at a computer or at a desk, and eating is the one thing that I have to get up and move around. This is already a problem, but it's going to get a lot worse in the next week.

For more context -- I am a 21 year old woman who just finished her third year of college. I am headed back home for the summer, and despite my best efforts, have not landed an internship or summer job. In other words, I am headed back to a small town where I will have NO money, limited transportation, and endless amounts of time.

In other words, a recipe for disaster. I can tell myself all I want that I'll stick to my 1200 calories a day, and I'll go running and do crunches, but without something to keep me busy, I will fail. I really don't want to sit around the house all summer and gain weight, but it seems like everything I want to do outside the house requires money (and also there's not much outside the house that I want to do. Or at least, I don't know of it, yet).

What can I do combat this? When I talk to people about this they inevitably say, ""just get up and do something."" Well if that works for you then great, but that doesn't work for me. I need to be invested in what I do. I have to *want* to do it more than I want to sit around and eat. And so far I haven't found anything that gets me up out of the house and requires no monetary investment.

I need something to look forward to in life. Help, please help. I've been trying for over a year now to lose weight and only managed to lose 17 pounds (and that was when I moved abroad and was busy settling in)."

[Mr. Klepacki, let me just say that Hell March 2 is probably the single piece of VG music that I play most often when I wanna get pumped up/energized for something, so thanks for that!  Do you have a single favorite piece that you've done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uhi3?context=5)|Thank you!  HM2 was a fun one to write.  I have many favorites since there are so many styles and projects I've done, couldn't narrow it down a single piece.
[The original C&amp;C Soundtrack was amazing. Target and Just Do It Up have been pretty much permanently stuck in my head for the last 18 years.  C&amp;C Thang is my favorite.

[Hey Frank, follow you on FB, just happened to see your post on here.  Thought it was nice of you to do an AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3xe2x?context=5)|First time I saw Star Wars, I made a musical connection right away.  First thing you hear is that iconic opening piece of music and all you see is text on a screen.  You know music grabs you if it can do that with no other real reference to connect it yet.  With all that in mind enjoying what your doing is also a big part of it, even when its stressful and you have deadlines.  I feel extremely fortunate that I love all that I do no matter the situation and that I've been able to evolve, adapt, and rise to the occasions all along the way to grow and improve and further my position to audio director and all other aspects of audio work aside of just composition, which of course is as much an equal passion as its ever been.  OK, that was a book!  Hope its answers your question and thank you!
[My question for you: How has your music evolved throughout your life?  Is your music influenced by things in your life, the game itself, or any outside factors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3xe2x?context=5)|Thanks for following on Facebook, and welcome!  Great question!  I predict a long answer... here goes!  In my own life, I can give some examples.  It evolved in phases.  FIrst off, my parents were musicians, so my fisrt exposure was from birth being around them playing and performing.  So as a little kid, I took it for granted that everyones parents must do that, and didn't understand when other kids were so overly wowed by it, for me it was part of daily life.  All the while I'm being introduced to new music, new artists, new styles, new soundtracks, and I would just take what affected me most and apply it to whatever I was working on at any given time.  Outside of composing full time at this point, I'm still trying to do something with bands, and what really inspired me to further myself in sheet music writing for horns was a band Home Cookin, which I later joined.  They had a horn section already but when the main guy became unavailable, I took the reigns and crash coursed learned what I need to do to make it happen.  Which of course translates to orchestra and beyond but it was a good starting point for me.  Experiences you have in life will also contribute to how creative or inspired you are and no matter what emotion you are feeling you can take advantage of it and harness it into music.  If you are composing something for a somber scene, you can draw from sad experiences in life, same with uplifting, or anger, anything.  I learned to channel it.  The game itself naturally is a big factor in style and all the various settings / levels and situations so referencing those directly is also a must of course.  From there, the art inspires me, the fun of the gameplay inspires me, and the team I'm working with does too whether they enjoy the direction its going or offer more feedback as to how to redirect.
[Thanks for making part of my childhood awesome, how has the switch from Westwood to EA and then Petroglyph come about? Do you miss the olden days of Westwood much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3ukdd?context=5)|You're welcome!  Westwood days were great and I always look back fondly, was a great era.  When EA consolidated, I didn't make the move to California, I stayed and freelanced until Petroglyph formed up.  I miss the way the industry in general used to be in older days - it seems that it is pretty rough out there now.  Petroglyph always feels like an extension of Westwood with many people we have from there.  I'm thankful that we can continue to make fun experiences and move forward as a creative team.
[Did you work on Nox? That was one of my favorite games of all time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca4236j?context=5)|Sure did!  
[Hello Mr. Klepacki!  First of all I am HUGE fan of your music on C&amp;C games. I listen to them often while I am jogging.  I'd like to ask what does the man say at the beginning of the song Grinder? And what language is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3v0bj?context=5)|Was told it was Russian, vaguely saying something to the effect of ""this is a Red Alert"" or ""emergency"" but I'm not entirely sure.  It was a sample from one of the games cutscenes while a major alarm was going off.
[Alright, I have to know. I'm looking to get into the music side of video gaming doing exactly what you do. How did you end up in the job you are in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3vwzq?context=5)|How I started, and how one has to start today, are two completely different scenarios.
 |•Quality has got to be there, has to sound like what's currently out there right now. Network, attend game conventions, talks on the subject of game audio, get a feel for things.
 |•Start small with indie devs or mod communities, get in some experience with working with teams, how the audio gets plugged into the game as to have a better understanding of approach to composing for it.
 |•If you pursue in-house positions, maybe start as an intern with a larger company, or junior position. if you're freelance then prepare to chase work more than doing it at first until you establish enough clients.
 |•Don't just pursue 'games’, pursue all media! Composing knows no bounds or formats.  The level of quality is all on the same playing field.  A ""game composer"" used to have the stereotype that you make a 'bleeps and blips' soundtrack.  Now its full symphonies, any everything in between.  
[Is there a game you wish you could've done music for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uf60?context=5)|Big fan of Unreal Tournament series and Transformers war for cybertron games, would have been great fun to work on for me.

[Do you have a formulaic approach to composing for a game, or does it differ from project to project? Are there common traits in other soundtracks that you admire or try to steer clear of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uh5j?context=5)|It differs project to project, but there is common ground in my approach.  As composers you can only write for one instrument at a time until you have as many layers needed for a section of music, but my approach is to start with the first instrument choice that is inspiring the new piece I'm thinking of in my head.  Whether its a French horn melody, or a bassline, or a drum beat, that's how I generally start it off, and if I'm hearing a finished section in my head, then I start with the fastest things I can load into the daw and crank it our asap before I lose the idea.
[Thanks a ton for doing this AMA, by the way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3uh5j?context=5)|As far as what I steer clear of, I try to avoid the things that are done to death in many other soundtracks, but it's tougher these days as everything's been written and tried for the most part, so now I think the main things for me to continue to set myself apart, is unique combinations of instruments I come up with, or delve into some progressive elements to mix it up.
[Favourite Synth ? Opinion on software synths?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3w3i1?context=5)|As a composer in many genres I need a ton of sounds at my disposal so while I will say Kontakt is my central hub with which to load up with custom banks of instruments, Komplete Ultimate contains majority of what I use today, and then I will then load in third party sounds into Kontakt like libraries from Cinesamples.
 |I used to have a rack of all hardware synths and samplers back in the day and while I have an affinity for some of those signature sounds and still have some of that gear, I definitely have embraced all software synths because saving all settings and instant renders are the only way to go now.  Of course I will combine that with live instrument tracks as well.

[Also, along with most others here, a sincere thank you. The music you've done for games is just incredible.

I have a question though, one of muy favrite songs from C&amp;C is ""Act on instinct"" and I wondered if the voices in the song were stock samples or extracts or if you have made everything up ?

[This question is a bit personal, and I don't want you to feel uncomfortable, but maybe you can give some sort of insight. What kind of pay can someone expect when writing freelance for games? Obviously it differs per project, but a range for larger and smaller games would be helpful. Also, what is the salary like for in-house composers at both larger and smaller firms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|If you are freelancing you set your own rate.  The pay scale may differ depending on how demanding the job is.  It's your choice whether to charge based on how many hours you work, or by the assets you are providing.  I generally would charge by the asset: per sound effect, or per minute of completed / delivered music.  You have to take into consideration of a buyout, meaning that if the client is paying a one time buyout fee that gives them the rights to use it for the project and you collect nothing further, what is that worth too you?  The game industry generally does not want to pay royalties in this category.  So then it's upfront payment, or milestone payment, or whatever is worked out on the contract depending on the work load.
[Are you receiving royalties from freelance game projects or are they up-front payments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|In-house position salaries will vary on your experience level and amount of duties you take on.  Most game studios these days want sound designers more than composers in terms of in-house.  The more things you can do to be valuable and flexible will open more doors.
[What are the licensing payments like for your material that UFC uses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|Licensing usually means you are allowing use of music for an agreed upon fee, in exchange for you retaining the rights to it.  Which traditionally would be a cheaper fee then a buyout in that case.
[Sorry if I crossed any lines here...you don't have to answer all of it. I just expect some of these opportunities will be open to me in the near future and I'd like some guidance on which will be the most worthwhile to pursue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca410ew?context=5)|Royalties in the case of television are collected through your performance rights org like ASCAP or BMI, and they track the usage and pay you quarterly accordingly.
[Follow up - so for example in the case of the UFC music, generally one would get licensing + royalties?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca427cx?context=5)|All clients are different.  Generally in more specific cases, (if they want a specific song) there is an initial license fee and then broadcast royalties.  But if you were to submit to music libraries that shop it around for you as part of their collection, then generally you're only looking at broadcast royalties.
[What is considered to be your most famous work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3wj68?context=5)|Command &amp; Conquer Red Alert is probably the most famous, but a lot of people have also gotten to know my solo albums through Ultimate Fighting Championship tv shows.
[I absolutely loved the soundtrack to the original C&amp;C - it's really somewhat unique music - have you ever thought of releasing something new in a similar style?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca3wo9m?context=5)|Why yes ;)   Have you heard my solo albums?

[I hate to think I'm contributing to a downward shift of the very industry I'm trying to work my way into.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca440ik?context=5)|Network at game conventions, attend talks, check out communities like audiogang, ask questions, but you want to be meeting people like producers &amp; leads on a project to get their contact info and discuss opportunities to pitch to them.  Take genuine interest in what they're working on and ask them about it.  Most important thing to find out is what do they need ""right now?""  Back to timing.  That's where their minds are most likely at.  I often tell composers to also become sound designers, because the industry tends to look for those more often than composers - then you can pitch for sound design work too, and once that's going well, if there's ever talk of music needs after, ""oh, what did you need there?  Maybe I can help.""
[EDIT: Also, how would you compare the video game scoring industry to the film and television scoring industry?

I would like to know your opinion on using HM1/2 wither a video featuring gameplay from Company of Heroes 2? Did Relic ever contact you/EA? Licensing could have been a problem, but a CoH2 teaser with HM2 would be epic!  If I made my own video, properly attributed, would that work as far as you are concerned?

Listened to a little of your other stuff as well which I've also enjoyed. Nice going and thanks dude!  Feel compelled to include a question - Do you end up with a lot of cut material when you put together a soundtrack? Do you often carry over cut material from one project over to another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca40ua5?context=5)|I don't end up with a lot of cut material usually, if I do, I identify it early on as something that doesn't fit and I'll keep it on the shelf until I find a home for it.  Experimentation is key - I'll often ""sketch"" out a handful of ideas in very basic form, a single track or melody or chord change, and I only pick the strongest ones to continue forward with.  Depends.

[Frank, I must say that you are a great inspiration to me. Not simply inspiration in the musical sense (although I greatly admire your work\), but more the attitude of 'Well my music won't be heard if I work in a band. Fuckit, computer games instead!' and the success you've had in a notoriously fickle industry. Your name is well known although yourself and Koji Kondo are the only computer game musicians I can name off the top of my head.  Do you think thatre there any opportunities around now for the talented, or possibly lucky, musicians amongst us in computer game music, so we can follow in your footsteps? Are there any other unorthodox avenues that would be worth pursuing for an aspiring musician?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eufbt/i_am_frank_klepacki_audio_director_composer_and/ca44jq0?context=5)|I appreciate that, thank you!  State of mind can play a big part in determining your path, and if you run on parallel paths for a while to figure out which one is better for you, than so be it.  That's basically what I did, computer gig by day, band pursuit by night.  Funny thing is I still do that, but the difference is my state of mind.  I'm not trying to kill myself over the band thing anymore.  I know what that's all about and now I pick and choose, only do whats fun, and I have no other expectation.  Where as video games most certainly is my ""career"" so I came to accept that years ago and so that's is always my priority above all else.  I've touched on some other things in threads below of what I think are ways to investigate pursuing it today.  The industry is pretty wacky so you never no from what angle something will turn up but constantly putting yourself out there and perhaps taking on some other skills and traits that compliment the field can be helpful to subsidize what is going slower in one area.  Audio renaissance guy is what I recommend for anyone.  More options you have the better.

[Absolutely loved you're work on C&amp;C, ever since I was a child... But I especially love your work on the Dune games.

 |Universe At War was just a straight up fun RTS with truly unique factions that played differently and had that sci-fi meets campy C&amp;C spirit and so it was a direct extension of that feeling of the past.
 |The End of Nations scoring I did had a lot more emotion and allowed me to make something a bit more organic.
 |Battle For Graxia was a cool fun and creative experience, much more akin to the old days of game dev with a smaller team, and more action arcade like qualities that I enjoy.

Got call from HR dept on 5/15 about setting up phone interview with Manager and Director of that department. 

Did phone call with only the Director, manager couldn't make it. Pretty standard interview(I think new to this, lasted 15minutes). Told me 2 things, that the manager will want to talk to me as well since she wasn't able to make it. And asked me what dates I was available to come in for a in person interview and i gave him the dates.

That phone interview was Friday(5/17), i sent him(director) a follow up email on Monday(5/20) thanking him and saying that I look forward to conducting an in person interview.

Its Wednesday now, no call from the HR guy about setting up a inperson meeting and the manager hasn't called me yet to talk. 

How much longer should I wait to take the initiative? And who do Icall? The HR guy?(thats the only phone number I have actually) If so what do I ask?"

Long story shortened, in the middle of our relationship i had a form of 'the talk' with my wife.  I wanted us to fix our db.  She said she has to finish school and internship and then will focus on that.  So time goes by, DB continues.  More life events and problems occur that our DB never gets to be a priority for her and i am suffering through all that same crap you readers are dealing with.  Then one day she says she really wants to have a baby.  We talked about this, i do want kids but i have said in the past we need to 'fix our sex' before children.  Didn't happen.

I wanted it to be a natural 'oops' conception and she was ok with that at first.  The first month wasn't too shabby.  She was more interested in sex but not for any real intimate or sexual reasons.  But, i figured it was a good step in the right direction.  At least she made an effort to get me in the mood.  This didn't last too long.  One month went by unsuccessfully, the second month became more of a structured intercourse month targeting ovulation.  This is where things go south.  She resumes her normal dead-fish routine, won't touch me or kiss me or do anything to make this enjoyable for me - i was the solely responsible to make sure i was hard.  I mentioned that this wasn't fun for me and that got me a pity over-the-underwear light touch on my dick.  Which, btw was freeking torture, my mind screaming DONT STOP.  Months tick by until we are able to target her ovulation with a test and it stuck.  job done. go me, i'm going to be a daddy.

Looking back it was fucking terrible.  Early into it I started to resent it even though i participated in it.  ""At least i am getting laid right?"" was how i tried to make myself feel better.  It didn't work.  Every single time it happened i was isolated, alone, frustrated, and *feeling like i had no choice*.  

Now I am relieved it's over, that I no longer have to have to try.  She's now sick and feeling shitty all the time so sexy times aren't even in the picture.  But, what's worse is that I am scared to want to have sex again because I know what I am in for.  So, now I am avoiding all of the arousal-triggers with my wife out of fear of facing those depressing feelings again.  Which is just making me more distant and likely compounding the problem.  

it's all stupid.  I just needed to rant and vent in an appropriate place out of hopes someone knows what I went through...  Please share your thoughts, advice, stories, whatever you got.  "

1euouv,1,2013-05-22,Where are the Statistics jobs?!?,[deleted],statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1euouv/where_are_the_statistics_jobs/,"I'm wondering where all the statistical type jobs are. I think this more of an industry specific question than for the general job's discussion board as I know of others in this exact position, and we're baffled.  

I live in the bay area (CA), a place reputed to be the hotspot of big data analysis right now. I finished an MS in Statistics and have been looking for a job for 6+ months now with no luck.  

I've been looking at positions with titles of statistician, biostatistician, data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, business intelligence engineer, and data mining in the Bay Area, OR, and WA. It seems that every position offered is looking for a PhD. Yet, all of the people in these current positions I've talked with (CS PhD's as well as the primaries interviewing me) don't seem to have the level of statistical knowledge to back up their data mining and machine learning techniques. They generally just treat them like black boxes.  

What does it take to get a job here? I know I have a strong background, and I've had friends (working professionals) critique my resume and cover letters. I've had countless phone screens and phone interviews. I've updated my linkedin, dice, etc profiles every morning, and get an endless stream of emails from recruiters. I've also been checking the jobs and internships links on the right. And I don't come off as being desperate. I've been told by several companies now that it was between me and one other person and that they really like me and want to keep my contact info for future possibilities. They just want a little more work experience.   

What am I doing wrong here? I thought statisticians were being swooped up like crazy here. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. Job offers more so ;P  (sorry if this ended up looking like a rant, but I feel like I'm taking crazy pills the way things are going)

1euitg,340,2013-05-22,Always Check the CD/DVD Drive!,area88guy,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1euitg/always_check_the_cddvd_drive/,"This one happened way back in the beginnings of my career. I was the System Admin for a small for-profit college campus in my home state, which meant 10% of my time was imaging machines, 10% was improving our systems and builds, and 80% was working on student laptops or desktops.

That last one always felt dubious. However, my boss stated that this was a service that we could offer to our students that would give them a bit more ""loyalty"". I didn't mind because it was usually easy work, and also because it just gave me more WoW or SoaSE time with my interns.

Enter Qiet Student. QS was a known, good person that I had seen around. She came in to ask if we could take a look at her laptop, stating that it was extremely slow and things were not working. After taking down her information and labeling the machine, she was off to morning class, and I booted her laptop up.

Of note: my office was directly across from a classroom, and I was required to leave my door open for approachability. The class across the way was also leaving their door open for late-comers.

As the machine starts to boot, I hear the CD/DVD drive spin up. It didn't concern me at the time, and I let it get into Windows. It automatically logged in, saving me that trouble. However, for some reason, the CD/DVD drive was immediately accessed and opened...

...blaring some pornography in my office at a volume level that could have summoned Godzilla. I was not prepared for this. All in the space of a few heartbeats, I had both thumbed the mute button and hit the Eject button on the CD/DVD drive. Neither immediately worked, so I *dove* over my desk, vaulting it like a parkour object, and shut my door quickly. 

I am not a small man. Luckily, I had brought my backpack that day, and it was filled to the brim with clothes. I had a work ""uniform"" that consisted of a button-down and tie, with slacks. Since I also attended the college, I would change into more casual clothing afterwards. This was in the dead of winter, so I had a t-shirt, large pullover, and jeans in the bag.

My lightning-fast reaction to the sounds had produced one flaw: my dual monitor system had become unhinged, and one monitor flew at the floor at speeds I couldn't calculate with my mental math proficiency. Thankfully, I made a critical LUK save, and the monitor landed on my clothes pack unharmed.

After closing the door, saving my monitor, and slowing my heart down, I dusted myself off and went around to check the laptop. It was still sitting there, DVD ejected, and loading up an amount of spyware and virus-spawned evil that caused me to consider an exorcism. 

There, in the tray, was an unlabeled DVD.

I knew what it had to be, and I wasn't too pleased. I was also floored; did someone really submit this machine to me and ask me to clean it, with this in the tray? I couldn't believe it, but there it was. Shaking my head, I took the DVD out of the tray and made my way back around my desk to pick up the mess of other items my vault had sent flying. As I do so, however, I hear the sound of a key in my office door. There were only two people with that key. I was one. The other was my boss. My ""not computer savvy"" boss, the one who believed that fear and job security were good enough threats for motivation.

Arrogant Bastard Boss steps in to ask why my door is closed, and I immediately cut him off with ""ABB, please close my door and allow me to explain what was delivered to me."" I used his first name. I never did that, unless it was a Big Damn Deal, and this caused him to pause, then close the door. 

ABB: This had better be worth it, 88.

88: It is. This student laptop was delivered to me, with this DVD in the drive. It began to play automatically when the laptop started up, and closing my door was just part of my attempts to prevent its sounds from being heard.

ABB: What? Give me that.

88: Sir, the contents (*the disc is now snatched out of my hands*) are not safe for work!

ABB proceeds to put the disc back into the laptop's CD/DVD drive, where it is popped back in and immediately played again. As it turned out, the volume control on the laptop itself did not work, but the door to my office was thankfully closed as the video began to play. He gave it five seconds before he paled, immediately ejecting the disc. Setting it on the desk, he came back around to me. ""You know what to do. Carry on."" ABB left my office, closing the door behind him.

QS returned four hours later, and I took her aside, asking my intern to close the door. I kept the intern inside, since I had told her the entire story, and I felt a female corroborating the story would be a bit helpful.

88: QS, a DVD was found inside of your laptop that contained pornography. This DVD was automatically activated when I started your laptop. I'm afraid that this will be the last time I will service any of your equipment.

QS: What? You're fucking lying, I don't watch porn!

88: See for yourself. The DVD is on top of your laptop.

QS boots her laptop, pops the DVD in, and gives it time to load. It does. She begins to watch the video. Thankfully, the volume was at about 1%. Her face begins to contort into an angry mien. She takes the DVD out, shuts down her laptop, and storms out. The Intern and I are left wondering.

Cut to a month later. QS comes into my office to request assistance with her phone. I quietly remind her that she is no longer entitled to support, which I hated to do, but she asked if I would reconsider if she told me what the problem had been. I agreed, since I was curious, and all she needed was one sentence to regain my amused trust: 

QS: The man you saw was my now-ex fiancee, and the woman you saw was my sister.

Trust regained, and I couldn't help but laugh."

With an awesome, brand new website, I need serious help utilizing social media to get people active and socializing again. 

I am looking for someone to manage social media on and for the website.  This includes (but isn't limited to) posting daily on facebook (photos, discussions), twitter, pictures on instagram, and videos on our youtube channel, and actively posting in the forum to stimulate discussion.  Even though the community is a San Diego specific niche community, this job in no way requires you to be in SD.  You can work from anywhere.  I work from home full time for another job, and run the site in my spare time, but am always available to meet on Skype, etc.

No real experience is necessary (other than knowing how to use all of these social media tools).  This is a great opportunity for anyone interested in marketing or related fields.  I can't currently offer monetary compensation, but once the site is active and rolling again, it will begin generating advertising income, as well as product donations from sponsors to be reviewed and demoed.  I have so much gear/boards/etc from when the site was crackin' before, I can't ride or use it all!  This will all be split fairly amongst the team working on the site.  Basically, you will get out what you put in!  Not to mention, previous interns (College Students) who have worked on the site for me before have used it as a reference to go on to full time marketing jobs (I can provide references of people who have worked with me on this before).
 
With someone focusing on taking advantage of social media and building the community, I can focus on the website design and building some of the advanced features I have planned for the community. 

I need a serious partner who lives to wakeboard and loves everything about the lifestyle to represent us, the potential for solid advertising income, and who knows....the sky is the limit!

If you have any questions, please ask!  I'm looking for a good partner who is motivated to make something happen!

I've recently been diagnosed with depression/anxiety disorder, and have begun medication and therapy for it. It's unclear how long I've been depressed, but at least long enough for me to waste 2 years doing really shitty in college. I am currently on academic suspension with a chance to appeal, but I'm not sure where I want to go with my life at this point. I have extreme issues motivating myself to go class (likely because of the depression, but I'm not sure yet) but I have to decide whether or not to appeal before I'll really get a chance to see how I perform after therapy and on my medication.

I'm facing a really tough choice. I don't know whether or not to return to college at all right now. I currently have an internship at a software development company as an assistant to the Network Manager, and I'm quite enjoying it. I've been discussing with him the possibility of becoming certified in various software applications to begin building up a resume.

The way I see it  is that I can either appeal my suspension and go back to school (assuming I do better on meds) or I can pursue certifications in various networking software to build up an impressive resume and try to find a job via that route.

I want to know what you guys think about the merits of both situations, and if there's anyone out there who would know what it would be like to attempt to get a job (in networking most likely) without a degree, but with pertinent software certifications.

TL;DR I fucked up my first two years of college really bad. Do I go back or try to get a job relevant to my current internship?

EDIT: Mentally, I'm perfectly capable of either option. Not to seem pompous, but by standard metrics such as SAT scores and IQ I am well above average, my problem is simply one in motivation.

EDIT: I guess I'm also really asking if it is a realistic option to obtain a decent job in networking without having a bachelor's degree, and if so how many and what certifications would I need? Is it even worth it to go down that path?"

I've been out of school since May 3. I go back to school at the end of August. I'm not sure how to bring it up without seeming prideful, so I'll just say my GPA is pretty good (though I am not particularly effective outside of academics, it seems). [Edit: Oregon, USA.]

OK, so I've been talking with this company - members of which I somewhat like - for about a month and a half now (not constantly, of course). I got an internship offer a week and a half ago but was told a few hours after the offer was sent (I hadn't replied) that it was to be an unpaid internship. I asked them about that and, basically, whether they were confident about the legality; they responded that they were.

The work would be internal - nothing that goes into production, ever. (It's not QA. Development of a developer tool, I guess it'd be? Not sure how specific to get.)

I may have something else I can do over the summer, but I'm waiting for someone to get back from another country for the last step (I networked with them through university). Also, if neither of these work out, I'm highly self-motivated and can do personal projects all summer (I have several I've been wanting to do for a while, and think I could finish in the next couple of months).

So here's my question:

Does this internship sound legal? If so, is it a good option, relative to the choices available to me? And do I have other options staring me in the face?"

- Testing out new digital marketing strategies
- Assisting customers with the ordering process
- Helping fulfill customer orders, refunds, and other inquiries
- Suggesting improvements to our customer experience
- Assisting our tech team with testing new features
- Communicating with clients via phone/email/twitter/etc
- Writing copy for promotions
- Looking awesome when you wear our glasses (free for you!)

Skills Required:
- MUST be a self-starter who combines a high level of creativity/initiative with strong organizational skills
- Experience with Microsoft Word, Excel, and advanced internet skills
- Effective problem solver who can work with minimal supervision
- Strong written and oral communication skills
- Ability to work in a team environment, handle multiple tasks, and complete tasks quickly and effectively

Other info:
- This is an unpaid internship (college credit is ok)
- This internship will start as soon as you can this summer and last through September
- If you impress, there is a very good chance this can lead to a part time or full time job
- Internship requires at least 15 hours a week (or more if you can swing it - the more involved you are, the better for everyone!). "

Can't Skype if he is at work. Can't call and chat for long if he is at work. Depending what he is doing at work he may not be able to text. I am awake when he is at work; he wakes up with just enough time to go into work, and next week I will be starting an internship. I will be waking up as he is going to bed; coming home when he leaves for work. Is a dozen text messages a day, everyday three weeks in a row, healthy for and LDR? An LDR under these circumstances? We used to Skype, or call everyday, have a skype date every now and then. He has a lassie-fare attitude with the relationship, so I am not sure if he would want to make time for a weekly skype date; his idea is that we should not plan our lives around each other. I have run out of ideas."

Need some thoughts on what my chances of getting a job look like at this point. I have a 3.14 GPA with a major in Math, and minors in Statistics and Actuarial Science. I have also taken a few courses in Economics, Finance, and Computer Science not explicitly required for these degrees. I am no a software developer but I have experience in Java, C, VBA and could likely pick up programming pretty quickly if that was something an employer wanted. By the time I graduate (next spring), I will have the first two exams passed, assuming I get the FM on the first try. Which I will.

Currently I have an internship with a large corporation for the 2nd summer straight with a non actuary job. They have an extremely small actuary department but I was unable to secure a position as an intern there, I am instead a Business Analyst working in product development. How will employers consider this? I will not have time to acquire an actuarial internship before graduation and a job search, so I'm curious as to what this means. Does anyone have any experience applying for jobs with an out of field internship?

Anyone have any advice besides the standard pass more exams/get your GPA up?

Thanks

So I've been writing part time for a software company over the past two years. My hours have fluctuated depending on what else I'm doing - use to be 30, currently is 20 hours a week. 

I write blog posts about online marketing for them, and I write website copy for their site, and help with research on larger products. I didn't go into this as an expert, but since I started, I feel that now due to my work I could be considered a semi-expert on online marketing, social media marketing, SEO techniques, etc. I've tracked some of my blog posts and generally they perform very well and drive a nice amount of traffic to the site. The company has expressed enthusiasm for my work.

Originally I started working for them as an intern for about $10/hr. A few times I asked for a $5 raise, and now I am at $25/hr. Technically I am a freelancer with them, and that's what I did my taxes as. 

Just recently I started doing research on freelance rates, and have seen that most ask for $50 - $100 an hour. Considering I am now doing fairly high-level writing with a good amount of industry experience, it would seem $25/hr is too low for me to be getting paid.

However, I don't want to burn bridges with this company as we have a nice history. Also, I know normally freelancers ask for more since their work is intermittent, but this company has always let me work 10-20 hours, no questions asked, so does that security mean I shouldn't be asking for a higher rate?

I don't really feel like I can ask to have my rate doubled suddenly...not sure what to do. Any advice would be very much appreciated!"

I got diagnosed last year and started some Concerta XR meds late February. Im currently having a hard time sleeping at night, but not every night. It seems a little random on when I can sleep at 10pm no problem, or when its delayed to 12am, or like last night to 3am...

Therefore, I'm going to ask my doctor to try Adderall XR now. Im on internship, so its a good time to trial meds before school starts up again. In short, these meds help my focus a lot, I get so much done (however i do find if i get side tracked to something unimportant like googling facts, that i focus hard on that....). I like what these meds can do for me, but I dont like this sleep as it makes me less happy with life.

In the end, I got by without meds okay (my problem was only completing %70 of exams in the time limit, with this diagnose I'll have more time, with or without meds) and I found ways to cope. So im wondering: if more med trials just leads to the same unhappiness from lack of sleep, will it be okay if I just get some Instant Release meds and only take them when I study for exams or do heavy homework, etc?

Has anyone done or been doing this? Does the inconsistancy in the medication end up causing negative effects some how? Thank you for your time.

**Tl;dr** can taking IR meds for a few days then stoppimg every couple months be bad for you?"

   My interest in the natural sciences began way back during my adolescent years, before I enrolled in college. Therefore, it was only natural for me to declare Biology as my major. At the time of enrollment I was aspiring to become an orthodontist, not because of a genuine passion for dentistry but rather a more superficial reason – they made big bucks. I would tell myself that it was fate that my interest in science would coincide with a high-paying profession. However, with such an artificial drive, the notion of making a career out of dentistry soon diminished, and I was left with half a bachelor’s degree and no real direction for my future. I acknowledged the consequences of my shallow pursuit and decided to go back to the drawing board.

   After deciding that dentistry was not for me, I was able to focus more on what was presented directly in front of me – the applications and practicalities of science. For one of my organic chemistry lab experiments, I was required to synthesize benzoic acid through a Grignard reaction. The product was then analyzed via IR spectrophotometry, gas chromatography, and NMR spectroscopy – I have never, in my life, been so fascinated by a piece of paper with lines. I also had the opportunity to work with a GC-MS, which completely blew me away. Furthermore, during my experience at a summer internship program at the University of California: San Diego, I was exposed to the purification, quantification, and analysis of proteins – techniques which proved to be equally impressive. Having wet my feet in such a manner, it was inevitable that my attitude towards science rapidly developed from a mere childhood interest into a strong passion bordering obsession. Armed with a genuine purpose to complete my degree, I began to inquire my professors about possible career options that combined both analytical chemistry and biology. Ultimately, I decided to pursue a career in the field of forensic science because not only does it involve the analytical aspect of science but it also integrates a great deal of problem-solving.

   I have always been told that I am detail-oriented, a great problem-solver, a critical-thinker, and all the likes – qualities that are essential for a forensic scientist. I have a superior sense of patience when solving puzzles, would gladly take on mentally demanding tasks, and above all else, challenge myself to achieve excellence. Applying these character traits into forensic investigation should not only come naturally but also bring about the greatest amount of satisfaction for me. Although I would prefer to enroll in an on-campus program, my current living conditions prevent me from doing so. In my search for possible schools and programs, I came across UFL’s award-winning, online MS in Forensic Science programs. With these fundamental qualities and my ever-growing passion for science, I am confident that I can endure the rigor and, in fact, excel in UFL’s online MS in Forensic Serology &amp; DNA program.

My problem is, my grades aren't that stellar. I got A's (and a B) on my introductory Physics course, but it was only because my prof likes students who suck up to him. I didn't really learn much.

Got D's in all three. Everything else goes from C to B+. (Will be taking up QM 1 and EM2 next sem)

I was already told by one of the older profs that my grades in the non-Physics classes would not really affect my chances of getting into grad. But my grades in Physics aren't that great, either. Will my current research experience (currently working on a paper; will submit to JOSA A when finished) compensate? Can good GRE scores and letters of recommendation help? Can an Internship help at all? Should I even pursue an Internship (there are no labs involved, so why should I bother going out of the country)? Will double-majoring in Mathematics help at all?

I want to know early on if I am screwed because as of now, I have absolutely no abilities that might be beneficial to an experimental field. A little programming (C++), but that's it.

Random probably related info: I'm from the Philippines, working on an Optics paper, want to go to Astrophysics/Relativity, currently a senior on a 5-year Physics course, not interested in staying in the country but no target destination, absolutely no ability to pay tuition even for the first year of grad."

I've watched female bosses get demeaned for just being in positions of power.  I've witnessed myself getting put down by coworkers after getting promoted.  The change in culture is almost immediately when I go from being somebody's equal to suddenly in a position just slightly higher than them.

And now, after graduating college, I moved away from my parents to live with my boyfriend. Yes, I love him and he's great. But I also am practical and know that we might not end up together in marriage, etc.  This town also provides a lot of career opportunities for me (job opportunities, an internship for the summer, and extensive training for a rape crisis center position).  The move had to do with both loving another person, and wanting to further your career. People are telling me that I'm ""stupid.""  For going after my dreams? Awesome.  I know that if me and my boyfriend (who I have been dating for 3 years now) separate, I'd find another apartment here and continue doing what I'm doing.  

Being ambitious is not equitable to naivety. I think I know what I'm doing. And even though I'm not 100% set on a career path or what I want my future to look like (And shit, career paths are more like jungle gyms than ladders, anyway), I feel practical about what I am doing.

1eti7u,37,2013-05-22,Found out I'm a pear - confused about dressing guides for pears?,telephoto,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1eti7u/found_out_im_a_pear_confused_about_dressing/,"So I've looking up some tips on to should wear if you're a pear... And everything seems to say that you should try minimizing your lower half and bring more attention to your waist and upper half. I don't get it. Since when is it a bad thing to have big hips? Why are big hips something I should try to hide? I understand balance--you don't want your bust to look super tiny against your hips, but why are these guides suggesting straight pants which would completely hide my curves? It's like there's a rule that if you're a pear, you can't wear anything that accentuates your hips or you're breaking fashion law. I'm not sure I like or agree with that. Can't I still wear things that show off my hips but also accentuate my bust a bit to balance things out? Is it even necessarily to accentuate my bust--what's so bad about looking bigger at the bottom in your clothes? 

I'm pretty new to this whole thing, so if anyone has an suggestions for things I could wear that don't hide my hips like every guide seems to tell me to do (but still suits my shape), that would be great. Or would that disrupt the rules of the universe?

Also, my measurements are 33-27-39. I'm around 5'8 and 135 lbs. I'm a college student and I think I need to revamp my style and ditch my highschool wardrobe for a change. I have a summer internship this year so I'll actually have the money to do that, but I still can't justifying spending more than $20-25 or so on a shirt unless it's a nice dress shirt or something that will last me for years."

I finally achieved it. I came in in the top 5% of my class and now I'm graduating in the top 5%. 

Every night that I stayed up until dawn, all the friendships and experiences I ""sacrificed."" The damage I've done to my body and mental health, all of it was supposed to pay off in the end and yet all it amounts to is just a little acknowledgment on a piece of paper.

I was on the shortlist for college valedictorian (in my college, once you get past a certain GPA then they make the decision based on other factors) and I think the reason I missed out because all of my accomplishments were just academic and professional. I was never involved in a college club or society, I didn't make myself a part of the community because I was so focused on achieving personal success: the perfect GPA, the perfect body, the perfect internships. I was just chasing the fucking dragon and now I realize that it feels empty and meaningless.

I'm graduating college tomorrow with all the ""success"" that I yearned for, and yet I have no real plans (I have an ostensibly prestigious job offer, but I think I'm going to decline). Doing school was the one thing I was good at and now that it's over I feel completely fucking empty. I really don't know what to do.

Audi TT, and Audi A4/S4 really get my blood pumping, but I worry about maintenance costs. I also really love the Infinity G35/37 coupes.

I've basically devoted all of my time to learning objective-c and ios development on my own. I've also taught myself a bunch of history and economics through research on the internet and I learned public/private key cryptography, the bitcoin protocol, mongodb and node.js on top of that.

I'm almost done with my first commercial iPhone app, but on the flip side, im failing a couple of my classes.

[What's the weirdest scene you've been involved with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca35ooz?context=5)|I've got two, will start with an easy one.
 |Spouse abuse case. I show up and the husband is like, six feet tall, 150 pounds...black eyes, red face, busted lip. His wife, no taller than 5.5 ft, at least 300lb+, is sitting there telling the cops why she beat him up. I also have to document the entire house to ensure they are upholding a proper ""standard of living"" and find a series of dildos on their entertainment suite. When I get to that area, I look at the scene commander and ask, ""You want me to shoot the dildos?"" He said, ""Yep...and I want close ups."" !!!
 |I think this one takes the cake, though. Very beginning of my career.
 |I get a call on the ""alert phone."" It's the base police. They ask me to report to building XXX whatever. I'm asking myself why it's such a familiar number...""OH, I LIVE HERE."" (Dorm/Barracks).
 |I go outside and there's cops, fire dept., ambulance - everyone. I walk downstairs and find the on-scene commander. He tells me to follow him.
 |As we near the entrance to the dayroom (lounge area) I see a blood trail and start snapping shots. We keep walking...I am now inside. We open the door and there's feces and blood...EVERYWHERE. On the phone, on the pool table, on the TV...
 |All of a sudden I hear a cop say ""found the probe""...not words I want to hear when I see blood and poo. I turn around to see this cop holding a billiard cue with the tiny end covered in blood and poop dripping down the handle.
 |We never found the bleeder.
[Is there a particular crime scene or accident you will never be able to get out of your head? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36fx3?context=5)|We had a report of weird smells coming from a house a few years back. It's summer and we all assume the worst. We open the door and are immediately hit with rotting human smell.
 |Doe had been dead for at least a week, maggots were coming out of his mouth, ears, etc. No visible sign of violence, he seemed to have died in his sleep. They bust out the ""glow"" light and we see vaginal fluids all over him. Best guess is that he died having sex. That's probably the best way to go.
 |Well, they can't leave any stone unturned so, as a closing act, they need to turn the body to see if there are any marks/wounds on his back. I'm on the business end of this event, camera ready to shoot as soon as they turn him.
 |As they start to pull him, his flesh tears off...like chicken skin. They get a better grip and pull him to one side. Yeah, it's terrible - every bit of liquid had been pouring from his anus for a couple of days...I still can't eat steak and broccoli with garlic because of how reminds me of that smell.

[Yep...that pretty much sums it up for me and this thread hahaha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3j7qz?context=5)|I laughed out loud when I read this.
[What was it like the first time you saw a dead body in person? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca38l2i?context=5)|If you can remember any awkward scene when you were a teenager or young adult...when you had to get in front of class or were scared but had to act...it was kind of like that. Very tingly sensation, remembering that these folks depend on me doing my job right. This was before the wars REALLY kicked off...so death was still new to me, even in the active military.
 |It's very strange to be alive next to someone who will never breath again. Realizing that their friends will never talk to them again, their family will never hug them again.
 |I had to go spend some serious quality time with friends after that...just to wash that feeling away.
 |Edit: I'd like to add that I also felt guilty to be alive...for some reason.
[How accurate are tv shows when it comes to crime scene procedure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3739v?context=5)|Haha, they're pretty terrible. First thing - I'm usually the 2nd person called to the scene. For the most part, NO ONE is allowed in without me shooting the scene first. Military defense lawyers systems pick apart crime scenes, so they rely on me and my images/testimony to uphold prosecutorial items.
[Relevant to this, which tv shows/series do it best in your opinion? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3joqm?context=5)|I really can't think of a show that gets the photography right. I don't watch too much tv - so I'm only current on the happenings of Westeros and what rick is screwing up in Georgia.
 |I'll say one thing - that ""enhance"" word needs to go from every imagery scene. No one's designed an algorithm to fill in the blanks where pixels can no longer resolve.
[Yeah, umm...that's what I was afraid of. I'm going to to have to revisit this idea in another time of my life, like maybe in 20 years. Thanks for the reply!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3az4x?context=5)|No worries, dude. I have kids myself, you can't help but make the correlation and then your day is ruined. Best of luck!
[What's the scariest thing you've ever experienced as a military photojournalist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca39fvs?context=5)|I'd honestly have to say every convoy in Afghanistan was the scariest moment of my life. You never know which rock or piece of trash has your number hidden beneath.
 |Getting shot at isn't any fun, but at least then I was busy taking photos of the guys around me - so that took my mind off it.
 |Also, nice name.
[Do you have news hair?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca39mct?context=5)|[Link to i.imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/e5hy15E.jpg)
[Do you have to take the crime scene photos so they are clear and useful for evidence, or can you take art shots? I'm asking due to your photojournalism background and an assumption on my part.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36h25?context=5)|Clear, sufficiently composed, sharp, and properly exposed. Yes, I do take artistic shots all the time - crime scene is just one of the many aspects of the job. I've photographed sporting events for all major sports, met celebrities, flown in dozens of aircraft, etc.
[Wow it sounds incredible, has there ever been a moment on those adventures when you stopped for a moment and just said to yourself, 'Dam I can't believe I'm here right now!' ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36ugg?context=5)|Yeah, man. Good question - just had memories pour over me.
 |I was in a valley, documenting an aircraft crash (class-a, loss of life, loss of aircraft) and stopped to take it all in. There are thousands of pieces of metal (and person) everywhere.
 |I'm climbing the side of the mountain, looking over the wreckage. At that moment my partner pops his smoke for help pickup. Out of nowhere this Blackhawk flies in like a bat out of hell and literally lands on the side of the mountain to pick me up. I'm now bugs eye, hanging out of the hurricane seat, snapping shots. Hundreds of people now look like ants, parts are still smoldering, fires being put out. I was like...damn...crazy times.
[Related question... say you were on site and took a few really beautiful , tastefully composed shots that would look really good in your portfolio (perhaps for employment after you get out\)...  what's the policy on copyright and ownership of those photos? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3u03d?context=5)|Good question. You can't make money using government equipment. You are entitled to keep any and all of your artistic imagery - as long as you don't sell them and they aren't sensitive in nature. My portfolio has many images from times when I was on scene at an accident.
 |Which brings up another thought - lots of idle time at crime scenes.
[I was one of my base's responders for a recovery team.  Thank you for making it possible for us to do our jobs, shitty as they may be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3kcyb?context=5)|Yeah man, I worked with a recovery team once or twice. You guys do the hard part, thanks for what you do. That made me remember something pretty cool.
 |When a jet crashes, I'd take photos of the wreckage - thousands of photos. A few years before cameras had gps, the investigators started assigning a civil engineer with a gps signal recorder to take a reading when/where I took a picture.
 |The team manually attached my photos to each tag and then entered into a program that showed where each peace came from, rewinding back in time before the crash happened.
[What ^is the most disgusting thing you've ever photographed/seen? Apologies if this has been asked before! :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca381no?context=5)|Any number of murder/suicide scenes come to mind.  If I HAD to pick one, I'd say that it was when a drunk kid punched his hand through a window in a door. It was one of those with the wire netting.  It got caught and somehow didn't sever an artery. So I show up and they've removed the window...which is still somehow attached. It's just eviscerated...like it had been in a blender. Bone, muscle, tendons...crazy, like out of a movie. He's sitting there saying, ""I fucked up, I fucked up...""
[What is the most grisly thing that you have ever seen in you job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca36wdp?context=5)|Um...well, do you want IN YOUR FACE or mentally subdued?
[Well both I guess! You choose. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3a3e4?context=5)|I once had to take photos of a friend who had died. She was wearing a football jersey and underwear, sitting there down on the floor with her face on the toilet - alcohol poisoning. I had to kneel down next to her to and take a photo of her face before they moved her. Standard practice is to take a wide, medium, and close up shot of every single picture.
 |I kneel next to her, breathing erratically. I pull the camera up to shoot and I see her face through the viewfinder. She's dead, but her eyes are wide open. Staring at me. I still remember that...4 years later I remember the look on her face.
 |Edit: a letter.
[Wow. I'm sorry bro. That must have been awful. What do you do to try and forget things like that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3by6i?context=5)|I actually had to go to counseling after that. I lost faith in the military support system at that point. We were being overworked, under rested, walked on and then punished for the slightest mistakes. I can compare this to a bout with depression - how does one get out of a hole that keeps getting deeper? Stop moving. Be still.
 |That very case made me come to terms with life and death. None of us are making it out of this journey alive...the sooner I figured that out the better.
[What the fuck. There wasn't another person that could have taken your position for times like this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3okge?context=5)|Yeah, frog and wodie - this actually doesn't happen too often, only once in my career. The thing is, I didn't know it was her until I was in her face. Then it was like time stopped and I was frozen there, staring at this dead girl who now had an identity. Didn't mean to set the story up like I knew it was her from the start, because I didn't.
 |Once I was there, however, I couldn't let myself back out. I was actually training a new photographer at the time - so losing my composure wasn't an option, for me at least.

Despite blood everywhere?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3o7kh?context=5)|Yeah man, you gotta think about the surrounding area. This single barracks has 100 rooms, and there are dozens of them in the immediate area. Also, since we were stateside, he/she could have got in his car and driven to a local hospital.
[You mentioned that you have to take three types of shot per framing (close, medium, and long\) - but do you apply standard 'photo' principles to taking shots?  Or is there a special type of photography that comes with the territory of crime scene documentation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3cpjj?context=5)|Crime scene photography, for the most part, does NOT take photojournalistic principles into account. All I'm concerned with is proper lighting, focus, and overall clarity. You want to take a photo that you don't have to ""edit"" when you're done, as any editing has to be done in front of an investigator and well documented.  Our method is as follows: Walk into a room, take a picture at the entrance. Go to a corner of room one, take a wide shot (overall). Go to the other three corners and repeat. You now have a 360 view of the room.  Once you've taken your overalls, you document any and every item of interest. You take a new overall of this individual item, then a photo from about 3 feet away, then a photo as close as possible.

Then, fields merged and we became photojournalists. When that merge happened, we were known as PA.
[Im in the Air Force, photography is a huge hobby of mine, and if I had thought about my AFSC more, PA would have been something of interest.

 |PA deploys quite often but, as I'm sure you know, the US is due to withdraw from Afghanistan next year. Deployment tempo is usually pretty high, but varies from base to base.
 |Officers usually take care of the strategic/crisis communications while the enlisted folks take care of day-to-day news and operations.

[Ever stumble onto anything, which was deemed classified in some way, or just standard crime scenes and such?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3eju1?context=5)|Oh yeah, man. I'd say the classified to unclassified ratio would be 1-4. Of course I can't discuss them...G-14 and all.
[Can you at least say *why* certain crime scenes are classified? And what sort of clearance are we talking about? Secret? Top secret?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3emm1?context=5)|Sure bud. So...lets say you have a standard breaking and entering call. If that happens in a Secret/TS or Restricted Area, that ENTIRE scene is classified to match the level of the highest classified item.
 |Other times an actual piece of classified machinery/technology is damaged...that's now a classified photo shoot.
 |Yeah, standard clearances apply.
 |Quick thought: There was recently an uproar over how many people have TS clearance in America...it's quite large. Just so you know, just having a TS clearance doesn't give you access to ANYTHING beyond why your specific position requires the clearance. Basically, if you have a TS at your office in Alaska, and you want access to my Top Secret files about a crime in Florida - sorry. The phrase is called ""Need to know."" Even with appropriate clearance, you can't access information that you don't need to know.
[Aye. And there's an entire different field of Special Access Programs, which is a clusterfuck of its own.  Ever been called out to take photos after a little green man got stabbed or something? :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3f01y?context=5)|Haha, no green men - thank God I never had the hassle.

My personal thoughts are that, yes, something happens when we die. I'm always thinking about what life is, where it ends. If life is just energy, does that energy just dissipate or does it transfer to something or somewhere?
 |Existence is way too intricate to cease when the human body ceases to function.
[Is it difficult to navigate a crime scene? I'm thinking that it should be, given that you might accidentally tamper with the evidence without realizing it (e.g. stepping on something that you probably shouldn't\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3clfl?context=5)|Lol, yes it can be a lesson in patience. I'm not the smallest of guys, so trying not to step in pools of blood, poo, broken glass, or other pieces of evidence was always a challenge. There are times, though, that it can't be avoided - you just take a picture before you enter the area to show how it was before you walked in.
[Was there ever a time where you were personally at risk or even a time where you (literally or figuratively\) dodged a bullet? great ama :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erzyr/i_am_a_former_military_crime_scene_photographer/ca3ec30?context=5)|The closets call I ever had was a mortar hitting about 30 feet away or bullets flying by maybe 20 feet away.

 |I show up and I see that no one is in custody, no ambulances...just cops. I'm like, okay...this shouldn't be bad.
 |I walk over to the cops and step on something along the way. It's pitch black outside. I look down and see that I've stepped on some furry handcuffs. I call the cops over, they're like - ""Yep, now it all makes sense."" Start of an hilarious night.
 |In all we found three pair of womens underwear, a few bras, an entire dress, and a few broken bottles of beer. In the grass adjacent to the flight line were even more clothes, womens accessories, and an empty purse.
 |I leave the scene laughing because none of it makes any sense. Yet.
 |Cops call me the station the next day - I'm asked to take photos of scuff marks and scratches on a few girls they picked up. None of them can make eye contact with me; then it hits me - they were having a lesbian orgy out there!

I live in a less-than urban area, and would like to score a virtual unpaid internship this summer to boost my resume/qualify for a special writer's program. It's important that the virtual internship be in the television/film industry, because that's where I want to work. Does anyone have any experience/advice/leads/need an unpaid, digital intern? 

I'm so sorry if this post is in the wrong subreddit - if need be, I will delete it right away!"
1etfim,4,2013-05-22,"I think my family hates me, and the feeling is mutual.",throwawayeddy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1etfim/i_think_my_family_hates_me_and_the_feeling_is/,"So, I've never done this sort of thing before, but I've only told one person I know how I feel about this, I don't want to bother him by saying it all again, and I don't want to say it to anyone else. 

So, I'm the youngest of four. I just graduated college, and moved back in, looking for work. There's a lot of tension in the house, because my father thinks I'm lazy for being unemployed, but... we'll get to that.

Anyways, I always felt like the black sheep of the family. I was born with high-functioning autism, and never really connected with my siblings the way they connected with each other. They always ganged up on me, teased me, made fun of me, that sort of thing. That only got worse when they all went to the private school my father's successful business got them into. I wasn't able to go to that school, because they said they wouldn't take a kid on the spectrum. So, I went to a public school in the city instead. They got the better education and prospects, and a circle of friends they all hung out with and talked about in conversations, which further excluded me. In a way, I've never really been a part of my family. 

My parents divorced when I was in middle school. That was the worst time I life so far. My mother was abusive, and so were the authorities at school (who I won't go into right now). My father got custody, and I don't see my mother much any more. 

My father shits on everything I accomplish. I got involved in politics, advocating against the war or for labor rights or on climate divestment- he never encouraged me, even though he himself was involved in work against the Vietnam war and for divestment against apartheid. Even when I take leadership roles in groups, he just ignores it, belittles any cause I care about, and tells me to focus on my work. When I needed an internship, I went to the farmer's market in the area- a farmer's market he helped found before he withdrew because it wasn't profitable enough for him- and even though they didn't have an internship available, I offered to work one for them, created the internship, and left behind a working internship program for other students in the area. He didn't say, ""Hey, great job making your own opportunity"", or ""What a good way to benefit future students!"". Just nothing. I graduated from college, having gotten their highest scholarship, and was the first of his kids to graduate, from his own alma mater- the same school whose prep school program wouldn't take me for being on the autism spectrum. He didn't even congratulate me. I recorded and released an album of original music, gave all the proceeds to charity, and got an offer from a small record company to do a professional album, and he hasn't even listened to the copy of the album I gave him. He never praises anything I do- just makes snide comments about my weight (I'm *not* that fat!) and calls me lazy for not having a job. 

I don't think he understands the job search these days. He's built up this mythology about what a great all-American up-by-the-bootstraps hero he is, conveniently forgetting that his father-in-law and his three business partners all helped him with the start-up money to get his company going, before the business partners dropped out and conveniently left the company to him. He hasn't had to look for work or fear for his job for longer than I've been alive, and has no idea what the youth unemployment statistics are- much less the statistics for unemployment for people on the autism spectrum. Still, he feels confident telling me that if I can't find a job while living in the country with no car to get anywhere for a job interview, that I must be lazy. I've applied to dozens of jobs, but he doesn't believe me- he never believes I do any work unless he sees me do it himself, because he believes that I'm lazy. 

The other night, my father came downstairs drunk, and starting rambling on about how disappointed he was that the woman he wanted to screw hadn't come over. I didn't say anything, so he turned to me and said, ""First good night of summer, I'll drink if I want to- fuck you!"". He'd always confided his romantic and sexual frustrations in me, since the divorce, even the ones involving my mother. He hadn't started drinking in front of me until my grandmother's funeral a year or so ago- he got sauced the night of her wake and kept up half the relatives playing music. So, the other night, he comes downstairs drunk and talks for three hours about how great he is for having money, and how every woman who's rejected him must have a mental disorder or been raped as a kid and be screwed up as a result (because that's the only explanation for not liking him- he's made the same theory about my mother. He has no capacity for self-criticism). I always act as his sounding board for this stuff (as have the other kids and my grandmother before she passed away), but he never gives a damn about any of my romantic problems. So, that night, just to give it a shot, I say (quite honestly, as it's been on my mind) ""I don't think I'll ever date. It seems like it's frustrating for most people, and seeing as I have a hard time with normal interaction, I'll probably never get the hang of it"". Now, you might think a father would here recognize the signs of a growing depression and try to comfort or encourage his son- but instead he said, ""Yeah, I don't think you'll ever date"". 

I don't think he gets how to be a father to a person on the spectrum, either. He likes to pretend he empathizes with me because he had a stutter as a kid and knows what it's like. He always tells me to never use it as an excuse or be dependent on anyone, but he tried to get me to play along with him in a benefits scam to claim I was too dependent to be considered an adult after I turned 18, so he could keep getting child support. He keeps telling to apply for disability, and any time he's angry at me for being unemployed, he tells me that if I don't find a job, he'll call the state and have them put me in a group home. He doesn't understand why I'm angry at the prospect of being forced into a group home, when my previous experiences in life include being forcibly committed to a mental hospital when my mother lied and told the police I hit her, being forced to take an addictive medicine (that caused weight gain and sexual dysfunction and relieved none of my anxiety) for years (and getting off it cold-turkey), and being segregated into dehumanizing and insulting special education programs that treated me like I had an intellectual disability (I don't- my IQ is 143, I've always been a top scorer in standard tests and AP courses, and I did well at a prestigious college). 

My brothers and sisters still gang up on me. Every time my sisters come home from the Cities, I dread it, because no matter how mean they are individually, they're meaner when they're together. They all seem to think they're much better than me- which is bullshit. One of them dropped out of a community trade school, went to drive a delivery truck for our father, and is being groomed to inherit the business by virtue of being the first out of our mother. He thinks this makes him a very successful and intelligent person. The younger of my two sisters went to art school and now works as a waitress because she can't sell the bumpy, painfully abstract lumps of acrylic-abused canvass she creates. The older of my two sisters has been trying to get her Women's Studies degree for the last six or seven years and draining the family's finances. Of course, after paying for three kids to attend a private prep school and helping one son to attend and drop out of trade school, one daughter to attend art school, and one daughter to attend an expensive private college for over a half-decade, my father still complains most bitterly about the 10% or so of my education he's paid for (after the scholarship that covered half the costs and my loans that covered most of the rest).

My brother likes to side with my father and call me lazy and fat at any given opportunity. Of course, he's the one who's a 28-year-old trade school dropout who's still living in his dad's basement and relying on nepotism at his dad's company to bankroll his lifestyle. My sisters, when they come home, enjoy acting like they are very progressive, countercultural, and knowledgeable about all social issues (when I'm the one that spent the last four years studying environmental science and policy and taking a leadership role in social activism- fuck, I have to worry about having law enforcement attention for my organizing role in the local groups and my close friendship with other activists who've been targeted, and neither of them have so much as attended a protest since Obama got elected). The truth is that neither of them understand a thing about politics (the way they talk, you'd think an unmanned drone shoots rainbows and laughter when a Democrat orders it deployed). In politics and lifestyle, my brother and my sisters have nothing in common but their high school and their genetics, but they still agree on one thing- fucking with me. I'm the constant butt of their jokes and object of their ridicule, and every time I try to say anything, they just laugh at me. 

So... there you have it. I hate my family, and I'm trapped in this damned house with them until I can find a job and leave. When I do, I'm not looking back. "

I'm here with my backstory to ask for career and life advice from you wise ladies (and men!) Right now, I don't really have any peers or friends to talk to about this, and I'm just feeling really lost and confused about where to go from here because, for some reason, I can't figure out how to make myself happy. 

Up until this point in my life, I've done all the ""right"" things (the things that I was always under the impression that I should do). I went to college, got good grades, completed two internships, and was offered a real, professional position before I even graduated. Great, right? On the outside, yes, but on the inside? I can't even remember the last time I wasn't miserable. 

I killed myself to get though school, working full time while going to school full time, and completing internships. At the end of the day though, I would tell myself that it would all be over soon, I would graduate, get a job, and just concentrate on work. Yeah, right. 

I stayed at my first real marketing job for 6 months. My boss would call me at all hours of the day/night to drop her new, insane ideas on my already overloaded workload, and I would have to grin and say I was right on it after my advice was scowled at (i.e. wouldn't this be better after we complete this?). I was a one-woman show for all of her hopes and dreams. I worked crazy hard, but just couldn't do it after a while, so I found a new job. 

Present day - I'm in communications at a large company. Everything started out great ... but now I'm even more miserable than I was at my other job. I'm jumping through flaming hoops on a daily basis to keep my job (layoffs and such) and I'm doing the workload of at least two of my more experienced peers - no exaggeration. I'm constantly under pressure, and I'm running on stress/adrenaline all day, yet I receive positive feedback from everyone I work with. I easily work 10+ hour days at work just to complete my work ... Then I come home and work. I end my day feeling disoriented and miserable. I'm miserable at home, I'm miserable with my SO, and I'm started to feel really down about everything, not just my job. 

The problem is that I don't see how this will change, or if I have some character flaw that makes people want to give me so much work to see if I'll break (that was a bit dramatic, but still). I can't tell if it's my jobs, my field, or the realities of being a young professional. No one talks about this kind of stuff with you in college, before you enter the real world, and I'm just feeling lost about what to do to improve my life, because right now working less and leaving work at work just aren't in the cards.

First, some background info: I am 18 yrs old, and it is the summer after my freshman year in college.  I begin an internship on June 3rd, and I am worried about getting drug tested.  The company has already had me sign both a job offer and a job description, neither of which mentioned a drug test.  Stupid me smoked recently, and I am quite sure I will not be able to detox in time.  Do you guys think I will be tested? If so, what should I do?"

1etcu0,2,2013-05-22,Saving for grad school in two years with $50k/yr + and $25k cash&amp;ST,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1etcu0/saving_for_grad_school_in_two_years_with_50kyr/,"First off, I would like to apologize for asking a variation of one of the most common questions to come up here.

I finally landed the job that I have been working towards for a while and with my new financial situation I have set to figuring out my savings. One problem is that with my chosen career path people usually go back to school after 2-3 years before moving up in the industry, so I am working on balancing saving for that with getting a jump on my retirement savings.

Some numbers:
* My new job pays $50k plus a bonus which is usually between $10k and $20k. Since I was an intern at my company until now, I expect to make $41k total this year with a bonus around $10k.

* I currently have a little over $25k in cash that I have intentionally kept liquid because I did not know what was going to happen with this job. (This includes $12k in a 12 month CD that I could withdraw by forfeiting all of the $0.36 interest or whatever that it has accrued)

* I expect approximately $2.4k/month total expenses

* My employer does *not* match 401(k) contributions  :( 



Preliminarily, I am thinking that I max out a Roth IRA, find the best short term vehicle on a 2-3 year horizon (not many choices, are there?) to put the rest of my non-emergency-fund cash, and then probably split the ~$1k/mo in left over income between my 401(k) and my short-term grad school savings (whatever that turns out to be). It seems like the 401(k) keeps getting pushed down the priority list with no matching and this looming education expense, but I would at the very least like to contribute whatever of my income is left in the 25% tax bracket (approx $3k + whatever my bonus is) to some pre-tax savings.

This turned out a lot longer than I had expected. So I would really love any insight anyone cares to offer, but I am particularly interested in what, if any, are good ways to save money on a 2-3 year time period. Some kind of bond portfolio? Also, what are the merits of funding school with a Roth IRA? It is probably too short of an investment period for a 529 to be any good.

Another thing that I guess I should look into is exactly how much I intend to have saved going into grad school. I'd have to crunch some numbers on the opportunity cost of the savings sitting around as cash for a couple of years vs earning returns in a retirement account but having to partially debt fund school (I expect at least $100k out of school, but then again: who doesn't?). It may turn out to be the most beneficial to dump all of the extra money I make into a savings account to avoid any educational loans.

I tried to make this as focused as possible, but I apologize if it dissolved into my openly contemplating. Oops!


Thanks for your time to anyone who made it this far down. :)"

Last Monday, I accepted a summer internship at a company that is 30 minutes away from home. I filled out an employment application, but have not officially worked a day or given them any more information. However, I found out yesterday that the business I have worked for for the past three years is hiring me again this summer (it was uncertain before). They are only a five minute comute, I already know the people, and the schedule is very open (I can take time off whenever).

I don't know if I should turn down this new internship and stick with my old job, or just suck it up and take the internship. I don't want to make anyone angry, but I think I'd be happier staying at the old place of work. 

Thanks, everyone. "

I recently applied for an internship writing for a small sports website that is opening up a boxing branch. I have already been approved on my writing skill, however, the next question they posed was about my knowledge of the sport both amateur and pro.

I have been a huge MMA fan for over 5 years, and with that came an appreciation and interest in boxing, though I have not followed it nearly as closely as MMA. I feel comfortable with the technical aspects of the sport (sport-specific vocabulary, rules, regulations, weight classes, etc.) However I think I am lacking a bit in the ""politcal"" aspect of the sport. (Who are the big names, who are the champs, who is on the rise, which fighters belong to which organization, fighter history, fighter styles, etc.) I think I've scratched the surface as a casual fan but that's as far as my knowledge goes.


My question for you guys, is: How can I receive a (sort of) crash course in what I need to know about boxing? Thanks in advanced for the help, everybody. "
1etapo,1,2013-05-21,"Internship lied to me, thoughts to sway or reinforce me in what to do next?",intern332,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1etapo/internship_lied_to_me_thoughts_to_sway_or/,"I landed a semi-valuable, overall enjoyable and productive internship at a medium size company in my area doing technical work related to my major of study. 

Long story short, I got hired on and explicitly told how much I would be making an hour by the two people I work under and hired by. I stumbled across an email between my boss and the boss of the entire plant where my hourly rate is in question and after 50+ hours of work they might reduce my pay significantly due to a miscommunication and error on their part amongst themselves. 

I'm very put off by this and think its extremely unprofessional. My fellow classmates are making what I was supposed to be making in their respective internships and its essentially the going rate. I had other internship opportunities I turned down that I would not have knowing that they were going to pinch pennies and not pay what I feel is appropriate.

The dilemma is that I signed a summer lease of 3 months in the area that I will not be able to get out of. 

I'm looking for advice on how I should approach this when inevitably they approach me in the morning. I badly want to tell them I don't feel the compensation is appropriate and how underhanded it is to change the rate AFTER I got hired and started the job. 

Right now I think my best bet is to suck it up and finish out the summer and if a job offer is included (which is very likely) to tell them to politely shove it. It just feels wrong and distasteful. I have been highly motivated on the job these past few weeks and I know there will be a negative effect on my performance due to this shiesty behavior.  

Other option I've been thinking of the possibility of is to tell them that since we are changing my hourly I'd like my hours reduced as well. This accomplishes me  1) still getting credit hours with my university for the internship, 2) Still being able to put it on a resume, and 3) Being able to actually enjoy my summer not locked up in a place that's screwing me over.  I don't know how it would go over to tell them I want minimal hours but it's an idea im playing with.

1et4b5,1,2013-05-21,"Encouragement, Prayer and/or Advice",[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1et4b5/encouragement_prayer_andor_advice/,"After working as a volunteer in several ministries over the past eight years or so, working as an intern for two years, serving on staff part time for about nine months and getting a Bachelor's degree in Biblical Studies, I am still having a difficult time finding a ministry position to serve in. I will be starting on my Master's degree in August (money permitting) and I am clearly called to serve in youth ministry.

The one thing that education and experience have left out is how to find a full time ministry position to serve in, outside of the church you have been attending. I check the online postings very frequently, trying to be among the first to apply for any appropriate position, but they typically fill quite quickly and I rarely get anything more than ""we are considering you for the position,"" and a day or two later ""we're sorry, the position has been filled.""

Tomorrow I will start going from church to church, looking for either available positions or youth pastors that know of available positions. I'm not willing to take a job that is clearly not a ministry to which I am called. I will not compromise with a church that promotes beliefs that I do not support. I'm not in it for the money, but if I am to serve full time, obviously I will need money to live on. The issue is not so much that I need the job for the money. The issue is that without a job that pays money, I will be left to take a non-ministry job for the money for my family to live on. This is, in fact, the reason I left the part time position I was paid for. It was very little pay, and I was happy to serve in the ministry, but the job I took required me to work nights to a degree that I was unable to continue serving.

I was never interested in youth ministry, but I ended up working in it a few years ago and came to realize that was where God was putting me. I am not interested in getting a job as a stepping stone to a ""better"" position. I am looking for a church to plug into. I expect to join a church as a youth pastor and watch my kids grow up in this church. I am more concerned about how well my wife, my children and myself will integrate into the church than I am about how much I will be paid. I want to join a ministry to serve and until I am serving in a ministry as I should be, I feel as though I am loafing about, not doing what God wants me to be doing.

I know that God has a plan. I know that the troubles we go through serve a purpose, in sculpting us for the ministry we will serve in. Obviously, I am not going to be able to lay out every detail that could pertain to these subjects in such a small post. Mostly, as stated in the title, I guess I am looking for encouragement and advice from other pastors who were looking for their first positions out of college. Otherwise, prayer has accomplished amazing things, but God loves to answer prayers that give Him the most glory. Such a large number of people praying would surely give Him glory when the prayer is answered. I'll try to remember to check back for advice and questions at least once a day, so do not get mad at me if I don't no life the post to catch every response immediately. It is almost 9:30pm and it will not be long before I leave for work.

If you have reached this point in the post, I appreciate the time you have put into reading it, the advice you provide and the prayers that are offered up."

I am a current junior going into my senior year and have had several interviews over the past month or so for internships. I have not gotten a single call back. I have no relevant experience as of now.

During the tech interview section I usually do extremely well, with several of the tech interviews having follow up questions that go beyond what is expected. During the 'behavioral' portion I also feel I do well, and am generally enthusiastic and try to make sure my passion for compsci shows.

I have felt all of the interviews have gone well (except for one), but have not gotten a single call back. What could I be doing wrong? When asked for feedback I either get no response or some canned HR drivel (""We felt you were a strong candidate but decided to go with someone else""...etc...). 

I am well groomed, no B/O or other such problems, show up early to interviews, and am well dressed. I am also decently sociable and by the end of a few tech interviews we are very friendly with each other talking some random CS topic or another (once the 'tech' questions are out of the way of course). 

When asked if I have any questions I of course do ask several, and I do some research about each company prior to be able to ask relevant questions.

The child was hospitalized for about 4 months while vital functions shut down one by one, and eventually died in his mother's arms.  The parents were there most of the time and handled it as expected, which is to say, they went totally nuts and handled it ungracefully, shouting and abusing staff regularly.  I feel I did nothing to help, found it the most unjust and sickening experience possible, and still have nightmares about it.

You did it quite well in the description.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca39ibp?context=5)|1)  I have been interested in this question for a long time but do not feel science is very close to really knowing the answer to it.  Neural processing doesn't 'tick' the way that CPUs do.  One way of getting at neural resolution is visual flicker-fusion experiments and I play with these from time to time.
[A few questions: What in our brain determines its internal clock speed?  (i.e. how fast we process ""stuff"" in our brains\).

They are quite rare.  As Oliver Sacks points out, savants are uniformly quite dysfunctional in their daily lives, so it is not clear to me that being able to expand capabilities in this way is actually a desirable thing.  Brains aren't computers and I think it's a good idea to think a little bit about why we have them, before focusing on how to overclock them!
[What is the mechanism behind Attention Deficit Disorder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca3fhhc?context=5)|A group of psychiatrists get together around a large table at a fancy resort and decide that they want to medicalize bad behavior in children so they can reap the benefit of lucrative sponsorships by drug companies.

[Are you honestly implying that you don't think ADHD is real? How do you explain adults with ADHD or children with inattentive type ADHD who are not troublemakers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca3nwad?context=5)|I do not endorse the concept of ADHD as defined by current diagnostic criteria, as a 'real' entity.  I therefore do not try to explain the things you're asking about because to do so would be to start by assuming that ADHD is in fact a 'real' entity.  I have seen kids who are troublemakers and adults who don't pay attention very well.  My take on this: If it is desirable to give those people amphetamines, fine; just do it.  Don't make up a fake disease to justify it.  Because of my feelings on this, I do not diagnose or treat ADHD, I refuse referrals along those lines, and I generally refrain from prescribing amphetamines for focus and attention issues because I think they do more harm than good.  I do not harangue patients who carry these diagnoses - I do not bring it up unless asked - and I try not to get on a soapbox about it in any venue.  That's the most ethical way I have found to reconcile my opinions and beliefs with the patients who come through my clinic.
[I'm obviously a layman, but hasn't there been double blind studies demonstrating the efficacy of certain medication used to treat such disorders?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca3keqm?context=5)|Amphetamines consistently improve function in attention and executive functions in all people; this includes people who have been diagnosed with ADD.  The medications used to treat ADD are generally amphetamines or similar stimulants so it is not surprising that they show these benefits, which have been replicated in many other populations of patients and healthy people as well.
[What do you think is the most exciting new development in neurology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca393ua?context=5)|I think the new invasive and non invasive electrical and magnetic techniques for brain stimulation are super exciting.  This includes deep brain stimulation for movement disorders like Parkinson and tremor; closed-loop neurostimulators to detect and abort epileptic seizures; transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression, epilepsy, stroke rehab, and other things; and maybe direct transcranial electric field stimulation from outside the head (jury's still out on whether it is truly efficacious, I think.)  As the technologists and materials scientists get together with the brain science folks, these modalities will just keep getting better and better.
[Thanks for the reply; I have just enough education to be able to understand the gist of your answer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca39izl?context=5)|A changing magnetic field is something that can be used to a) penetrate the skull and b) induce localized electric fields in actual brain cells.  The effect that can be achieved is to temporarily inactivate part of the brain, at least if it is near the surface of the brain (deep structures are harder to access this way.)
[Now I'm going to have to try to understand why magnetism would affect brain function. Sounds fascinating.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca39izl?context=5)|I knew a radiologist who was playing with one of these TMS devices and made herself unable to speak for 2 weeks; they are clearly not toys.
[What are closed-loop neurostimulators and how do they abort epileptic seizures? Could you go into more depth on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca3ayy6?context=5)|Northstar Neuroscience and Medtronic are two companies that have trialed this type of device.
 |Epileptic seizures are in a way electrical disorders.  Neurons are electrical cells and they work in part by changing their electric potential - they move charged ions around and the inside of the cell becomes briefly more positive; that is called an 'action potential.'  When a lot of neurons have action potentials at once, they are synchronized; when the entire brain synchronizes, that is abnormal: it causes an epileptic convulsion.
 |These devices have a sensing electrode, which is meant to detect the abnormal electrical synchronization as it starts; and a stimulating electrode, which delivers electric current to part of the brain in the hope of de-synchronizing or otherwise de-activating the epileptic seizure as it begins, before it spreads to involve the whole brain.
 |The trials have not shown ideal results.  Some of the devices got infected, which is a catastrophe of course; other times they scarred over and quit working; other times they just didn't seem to work.  Sometimes they did appear to work, however, and that is very encouraging.  I tend to feel that these devices will be improved by scientists and that eventually, once the technology is better, they will be in widespread use.
[I came here hoping that you could shine some light on all the idiots calling ADHD a fake and made up disorder. I hit CTRL+F&gt;ADHD and you think it's fake???

My behavior was in no way a factor in my diagnosis. (As I'm sure many can attest to.\) It's not a behavioral disorder, it's neurological. I hoped and assumed you would understand and know this. Did you come about this conclusion by yourself or was it taught to you?  Do you think that people with depression should just ""quit being sad"", people with tourettes should just ""stop twitching"", people with aspergers should just ""be more social""? How is one more believable than the other? **My biggest *WTF*:** How can you claim to be OCD but you don't believe that ADHD is real? There has been more fMRI data, AKA actual neurological evidence, done for ADHD than OCD. (As far as I can tell with the research I've done within the last 30+ mins.

[Why is it so hard to get a working definition of autism?  As a layperson, it looks like there is really a whole bunch of stuff going on there that people don't agree on.

Can you shed any light on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca3adf7?context=5)|I have noticed that over the years, any diagnostic label used to mean that a child will never acquire normal intelligence or normal functioning will become heavily stigmatized.  We obviously don't call kids imbeciles, idiots or morons any more, although when those terms were originally used most physicians used them without any malicious intent.  Mental retardation, developmental delay (a silly term because those affected do not eventually 'catch up'), and even static encephalopathy are starting to be criticized on the grounds of being derogatory.
 |We now have a sheaf of new terms - autism, pervasive developmental disorder, et cetera - to apply to the same kids.  Parents are universally extremely displeased - that is putting it mildly - to receive any news along these lines regarding their kids; and I think many folks would be surprised how strongly angry parents can influence both diagnostic and treatment thinking in the exam room.
 |It's a sensitive topic for these reasons and honestly I think that the need to be sensitive and dance around these issues to some extent, while important for good bedside manner and good patient care, also has the effect of complicating the science unduly.

About half my med school class majored in something non-sciency.  The admissions committee also looks for evidence that you're a decent human being, have learned how to handle stress, and can take advantage of opportunities that you're offered - i.e., a self-starter.

I don't have one single great answer; most cases have something interesting about them and I was trained to be able to look for that interesting angle and explain it on rounds.  I diagnosed a young man with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy at the bedside once (confirmed with imaging and lab tests of course); he died not long after.  Now that we have good AIDS drugs that doesn't happen much.  I've diagnosed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, primary progressive aphasia, adrenoleukodystrophy, and weird strokes.
 |In general I like a case where I can use my clinical skills at the bedside to construct a proper differential diagnosis; that is where the mystery and the detective work come in, and I love that part of my job.

My partner will remember this one if he ever reads this.  He encountered a patient who had been referred for weakness in grasp of his right hand.  The referring doc had quite correctly suspected palsy of the ulnar nerve, and my partner was a neuromuscular expert.  Kicker was the fellow had recently lost his health insurance; I happened to know my partner was doing the nerve conduction study/EMG for free because I had to authorize that.
 |He asked me if I would take a look at the patient, knowing nothing else.  I love that kind of challenge.  Because he was asking me, I assumed the NCS/EMG had been nondiagnostic, though he told me nothing.
 |The fellow came out into the hallway and I offered him my right hand and insisted he shake with his own, the affected one.  He indeed could barely grasp my hand.  I observed - by feeling during the handshake - abnormal spastic and delayed recruitment in not only the hand but some of the wrist-flexor muscles.  Simultaneously my nose detected that the fellow, who was wearing a plaid flannel shirt, just reeked of cigarette smoke - was the kind of fellow who is a deeply-inhaling 3 pack a day man.  And I guessed his age to be about 50.
 |I let go his hand and stated, ""Pseudo-ulnar palsy due to dominant superior parietal lobule ischemic infarction, likely due to embolus from symptomatic severe left carotid artery stenosis.""  My partner the nerve expert - he'd been with me 3 weeks at the time - looked at me like I had laid an egg: as I had just proposed stroke, in a patient who was thought to have a problem with the nerve in his arm, after meeting him for less than 5 seconds.  A few phone calls later, a good friend had set him up for a free MRI and carotid ultrasound, which confirmed my diagnosis the next day.  We got him hooked up with Medicaid and a surgeon fixed his busted artery not too long after that; the hand mostly recovered.
 |I'm not always that good, but I get a real kick out of it when I am.  The guy still smokes tobacco, by the way.
 |Here's another: an 89 year old man came with a puzzling story.  He was found at home by a friend, emitting gibberish nonsense speech.  His speaking recovered and by the time I saw him he had slow speech, with trouble finding ""low-frequency"" words, but intact comprehension.  He told the story that a day prior he had the sudden onset of difficulty speaking and difficulty using household appliances.  He loaded the clothes washer with dishes, could not figure out how to operate the microwave, placed groceries requiring refrigeration in his underwear drawer, et cetera.  He also displayed a bruise on his right arm, sustained when he bumped into a dresser ""that shouldn't have been there.""  He was very clear that these symptoms were sudden in onset - not there one moment, present at full intensity the next.
 |My diagnosis was infarction of the anterior branch of left posterior cerebral artery.  Clinical findings of aphasia, apraxia, and a transient right-sided visual neglect or visual deficit (the visual deficit had resolved by the time I saw him.)
 |Trouble with that was that his brain MRI, done just before I saw him, was normal - showed no stroke at all.  I told 3 doctors and six nurses that I didn't care and that this man had had a stroke; one of the nurses wrote me up with a formal report that I was ignoring the MRI report and practicing inappropriately, which was why I had to speak to five other nurses.
 |The next day the repeat MRI which I insisted upon revealed the stroke.  Turns out there is a thing called 'pseudonormalization' of the MRI scan which can occur in up to 2% of strokes.  I call it ""The neurologist was right and the radiologist was wrong.""  I like it, guarantees I will never be put out of business by machines.
 |Six weeks later the guy still could not operate his appliances and he had to move into an assisted living facility.  Most neurology stories don't have a happy ending, so I try to at least remember the ones that make me out to be a modern-day Dr House.

I cannot think of any single human behavior that has been shown to have more catastrophic health effects, other than things that are instantly fatal.  The idea of a nootropic (which incidentally I think is a silly word because it's the kind of thing that Penelope's suitor Antinoos would have wanted) is that a drug could be taken to enhance or improve mental functioning.  Amphetamines clearly improve performance on all sorts of cognitive and functional tests; and have all kinds of deleterious side effects; it's not clear why people who don't mind harming themselves look further, and indeed many do not.  I don't think that the data is there to support the use of things like piracetam, selegiline, modafinil and its analogs, and a lot of other stuff that people use off label because they wish their brains worked differently than they do.  It's not so much about safety for me; it's that I think the quest for brain enhancement in a pill may be fundamentally misguided.  I do not prescribe nootropics or anything like them.  First of all, waivers like that are not legally enforceable.  Secondly, if you presume that I know more about the topic than the guy signing the waiver (which may not be true, but if it is), then it's not ethically acceptable.
[I made the comparison to smoking, because it's something that a lot of people do fairly voluntarily on a regular basis, knowing all the risks, and it's a fairly accepted habit. (Incidentally I gave up smoking ten days ago. Going strong so far.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca3h1us?context=5)|Lots of reasonable folks disagree with me.  That's fine.  I sometimes think it might be neat if there were a profession devoted to knowing about and dispensing/prescribing these sorts of neurochemical manipulations, like a modern shaman or something.  We're pretty far from having anything like that and I don't see society being very accepting of such a thing anytime soon.
[Think of it as plastic surgery for the brain. Unneeded? Yeah. Harmful? If overdone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca3h1us?context=5)|I really don't think people understand what their brain is for, what it evolved for, the ways that it is tuned and attuned to the normal environment, and I think a lot of people want to 'enhance' its function without even giving a lot of thought to what those functions are or ought to be.
[Would some therapists not qualify as modern shamans? They give you advice and they prescribe you brain-altering drugs. There's less mysticism, but that's about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1esbkv/i_am_a_neurologist_a_physician_specializing_in/ca3i7bj?context=5)|My ex-wife was a therapist and was proud of being at least somewhat science-based, as are most therapists I know.  I think she would have been offended to be called a shaman, though I personally think you may be on to something.

1exrni,6,2013-05-23,Doing some work for free while I'm in L.A.,IncidentOn57thStreet,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1exrni/doing_some_work_for_free_while_im_in_la/,"I'm finishing my second year at university in the UK and this Summer I'm going to L.A. til early August to see my girlfriend. My parents are paying for the trip on the basis that I do a lot of networking and build valuable contacts.

As this was relatively last minute to secure this trip I haven't got a work visa nor was I able to apply for any internships or anything. This means I can't get paid for any work, which makes my parents plan for me about going there to look for work quite difficult. My plan is to the volunteer for the L.A. film festival then late June/July, search around craigslist to see if any crews need anybody for anything (though probably not for post-production).

I have some experience, I wouldn't kid myself on being an expert on anything but I'm here to learn. I'd most likely be best use as an extra hand as I know that's always useful. As long as I can take down names, make some friends and watch films being made. Any work you need doing.

Does anybody have any good advice on the best place to look? Anybody in L.A. working on a project in July and need an extra or a runner?"
1exqxf,1,2013-05-23,The commencement address you will never hear. But every graduate should.,[deleted],MURICA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MURICA/comments/1exqxf/the_commencement_address_you_will_never_hear_but/,"Young Americans, my generation has failed you.

In our time, we enjoyed decent public schools and low college tuition, and many of us sailed through them securely on our way to a middle class life. Today, as class sizes grow and schools crumble, our kids slip to the bottom third of developed countries in math and science. Most of our fourth graders don't read proficiently. One in five kids graduates high school illiterate -- if they finish at all. The majority of our African-American and Hispanic boys drop out. The majority. Far from the outcry this deserves, there's barely a whisper in the media about our drop in educational achievement, though we can count on hundreds of reporters to turn out for a court date featuring Lindsay Lohan.

Standards have slipped, we've deprioritized education and we've hardly even noticed. And young Americans, you are suffering as a result, arriving into adulthood without the knowledge and skills you need.

Older adults enjoy ridiculing you for your ""slacker"" ways, while we brag about how hard we had it. You know -- walking uphill through the snow for five miles both ways to go to school.

Young Americans, that you are slated to be the first group in American history to be less educated than your parents is our fault, not yours. While you were children, we allowed college costs to skyrocket 400%, pricing many of you out altogether, as though higher education is a luxury good, like a Rolex or a Ferrari, an extravagant perk for the rich only. More of you shoulder part- or even full-time jobs during college than ever before: the majority of you struggle with twenty or more hours per week of work while attending college. As a result, most -- most -- of today's college students drop out, and the top reason is that ""the need to work and make money"" became too stressful.""

For those who do stay in school, many in my generation have taken advantage of you, hiring you as unpaid interns to do our grunt work in record numbers, when you deserve to be paid for your work just as we are. We ridicule you for living at home, instead of appreciating your family's willingness to sacrifice and support you during a time of the highest unemployment rates for college grads in over a decade.

Young Americans, you deserve more than platitudes about reaching for the stars. You deserve a quality public education, low cost college, and more than McJobs upon graduation. My generation has failed to deliver those basic items to you.

At a minimum, you deserve our apologies and our respect. Because you are the ones who are walking uphill through the snow.

I (23 f) had been dating this guy (22) for 7 months.I was his first everything; kiss, sex, etc. During those months, I really enjoyed his company, he paid lots of attention to me, we never fought, all good traits of a healthy relationship. The only thing that concerned me was his lack of drive for his career. When we met, he was in his senior year of undergrad, hoping to become a detective. I started noticing how he would procrastinate with his school assignments; submitting them 2 minutes before an online deadline. He kept putting off his application for the local police academy. It really concerned me. 

I guess I should back up. I'm a junior, as of this fall, and I am a very determined person, so much to the point I will start working on a project the day it's assigned, even if it's not due for a month. You can see why this would irritate me.

I broke up with him under the terms that I wanted to focus on school (true), and that I wanted him to not have to wait for me or follow me around the world, as I want to work a few years internationally before settling down (Also true). Obviously, I still loved him, but it wasn't fair. Anyways, 3 weeks later (one week ago), we start talking again, because guys, he's my best friend. We eventually agreed on being friends with benefits. 

A few days ago, he told me he was going on a date. I tried to express a sort of happiness for him, but by the end of the conversation, I told him I was scared. Scared that I wouldn't be able to hang out with him again. Especially not with her, I have major jealousy problems. Major. Like some may even label me ""bat-shit crazy"". 

Fast forward to yesterday. He had the date, a girl he met on okcupid. He even showed me her picture. SHE LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE ME; same hair cut/ color, makeup style, and I swear I owned 2/3 outfits she had in her pictures. I'd never seen a more convincing doppleganger. It really hurt me. I felt like I was completely replaced.

I was supposed to go to a house party with him after their date. I told him I wasn't feeling well, and that he probably didn't want to hear what I had to say. No reply. A few hours later, I ask for all my stuff back. No reply. Delete him on facebook and my phone. I end up crying myself to sleep after two hours. Woke up at 5 am, from a dream about him. Cry. No reply. Decide to get all of his things together and put them on his porch. Text him at 5:45am telling him his stuff was there and to do the same with mine. No reply. 

I'm at a loss of what to do. I love him so much. Not to sound cliche, but I haven't been able to eat since 2 days ago. I've tried everything to keep my mind off him, and nothing seems to work. The worst part about it is, it's summer and all my friends have left town for internships, study abroad, or just to go home. It's literally just him and I, as far as our friends go. I want him back so bad, even though I know I'm the dumper. I'm just scared of ending up married to someone who doesn't take their career as seriously as I intend to take mine. 

Any advice would be helpful. Thanks."

I'm going to try to keep it brief, but this is an unusual offer. 

If anything about this sounds intriguing or if you have any constructive comments, then definitely get in touch with me with some info about you, your experience and situation.

I have been working at a small digital marketing agency since early last year, originally with a team of ~5. Since January, I've been running the day-to-day ops, managing all clients (generally restaurant industry) and doing all the work singlehandedly. I'm good at my job, but I'm at a bit of a crossroads and I have to either move on, or make a commitment and really go for it with this company, but for that I will need some help and I don't think an intern or another employee will cut it. 

We've got some great clients and really exciting leads. I don't own the company, but have a great relationship with those who do. To be honest, I've been reluctant to get involved in that aspect of the business because I feel inexperienced (I'm in my early 20s, this was my first job). I'm looking for someone who is looking to join as somewhat of a partner in crime, and really help grow the agency and make it into our own thing. Obv, this isn't much info to go on, but I'm willing to divulge more to anyone serious. Let me know your thoughts...

&gt;**Description:** See above

&gt;**Location:** Central London
&gt;
&gt;**Salary:** TBD
&gt;
&gt;**Requirements:**  You've got good agency and marketing experience (preferably social media), and are also very interested in the entrepreneurial/businessy side of things. 
&gt;
&gt;**It'd be nice if:** You've always dreamt of starting your own creative agency, but were just looking for the right opportunity to come along. This is it, on a plate.

I've been fortunate enough to land a summer internship for the 4th consecutive summer (advancing from a media production house to a small SEO company to a local ad agency), especially because this one is at a separate agency where I can gain exposure to the operations of the entire company.

Although I appreciate everything I've learned from my previous experiences, I'm hell-bent on working my ass off to turn this internship into something along the lines of an entry level position. I figure this is my best avenue to landing a job in the industry, and during my phone interview, the hiring manager hinted that many interns at this agency end up working with the company on a paid, full-time basis. However, I don't want to make myself too comfortable in assuming that all interns at this agency eventually climb the ladder.

Aside from the obvious things I should do (maintain flexibility, enthusiasm, diligence, and dependability), what else would improve my chances? 

Other information: this agency is based in Los Angeles and the internship is unpaid. I've offered to come into the office 40 hours a week. My interest lies in strategy."

I LOVE coding. I want to be a software dev someday, I am pretty sure about that. But I'm now very close to graduating (in the fall) with a lot of debt and no experience. I'm getting really desperate here. I've interviewed for a ton of internships and jobs (including unpaid work) and haven't gotten any of them because I don't have any projects or relevant experience (yes, they've told me this explicitly). 

I'm working on a few independent projects right now just to get SOMETHING in my portfolio, but it has been tough going. I love writing code but I'm kind of limited in what I can do thanks to not paying any attention in class for all those years. I have shown the ""projects"" that I have finished by myself to CS professors/TAs, who have told me (nicely) that they are not really going to impress anyone.

I will do anything to get my foot in the door. But where can I find a job or an internship or a project that will take on someone like me? "

I'm a rising junior college student and just wanted to do a sound check on some plans I had re: babby's 1st credit card.

**My financial situation:**

* ~$1500 in savings
* ~$500 in checking
* ~$1200 in Roth IRA
* I work as a RA and receive $1500 stipend for the school year
* Internship this summer has a stipend of $1500
* Fortunately do not have any loans as my parents pay for tuition.

**Reasons for credit card:**

* I do a fair bit of online shopping and the extra protection from fraud would be nice
* Internship in New Orleans this summer and my school recommended students use credit cards so there's no worry about not having enough money in checking and protection
* Would like to build credit

**Expenses:**   

* Textbooks (parents would probably supplement this)
* Clothes (usually pretty good about not making impulse buys but I tend to buy higher end items^(on sale though!))
* Food (although there's a meal plan through school, I often make impulse buys off campus for like coffee or lunch)
* Household supplies (e.g. face wash)
* Gas for car
* $5/month for Spotify
* Miscellaneous stuff

I plan to pay for any credit card transactions through my checking account and do not plan on carrying a balance. My goal is to keep my spending in check so I can always pay it off in full. Worst, worst case scenario, I would probably be able to borrow money from my parents to pay something off.

The credit card I'm looking at is Citi Forward for College Students."

Does this sound terrible to anyone else?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ewa9v/got_a_job_offer_does_this_sound_terrible_to/,"Hi, I am sorry if this is the wrong place and is long-winded, but I just need some career path advice. 

I graduated from college with a BS in Accounting in May 2011, and got my first ""real job"" not even 2 months after. I do not have my CPA, and I am not considering trying to get it (probably a big mistake on my part, I know).

Before this job I worked at a Kroger for 6 years, and did a few summer internships at the CPA firm where my mom works. The company I work for now is a a small company (5 people in the accounting department) that do the work for a chain of convenience stores, a Papa John's restaurant, a lumber mill, and a spattering of a couple of other companies. All the work I do is focused on the 16 convenience stores. I do the bi-weekly payroll for 80 employees, pay all the payroll taxes and do the returns, help the AR and AP clerks with any problems they might come across and check their work before posting, and to prepare the financial statements before being presented to the owner. 

One of the partners from the accounting firm my mom works at forwarded my resume to another small company that is one of his clients. They just fired the lady who did all their bookkeeping when they found out she had embezzled about $200,000 from them. He set up an interview, and I went in and interviewed with this company, he also came along on sat in on the interview. They need a ton of help, and it sounds like it is a nightmare. I would be the only accounting person, but I would have the resources to talk to the CPA firm and they would have people there to help me work and get everything cleaned up and in some working order. Also it is a small type company like I am at now where the owner owns about 6 different businesses and I would be keeping the books for all 6 of those companies. 

My problem is that I do not know if I really want to go to another small company, and I really am not too thrilled about being the only accountant on staff. I do not think I have the experience to do everything from AP, to AR, to preparing the financials, paying all the bills, it just seems like too much, and in the short-term I do not think I would be able to help that much. My parents both say that I am selling myself short and Ted, the partner from where my mom works, would have never set up this interview if he didn't think I would be able to do it. They also said that I would never know what I am capable of and what I want to do unless I take a chance and step out of my comfort zone. 

So, I guess I just am looking for some advice and any input from someone if they were ever in a similar situation about what I should do. I know I would be making more money if I took this other job, but I just don't know if it is a good fit for me.

**Edit** - I guess I should also add that I live in West Virginia, and I still live with my parents. My current job and this new one are in a rural area that I would not want to move to. As it stands right now I have about a 20 minute commute from my parents house to work each day. If I were to move out of their house to somewhere I want to move my commute would basically double. "

But I'm better than them. Especially in lying. My Report is just an example.

1ew7ed,33,2013-05-23,Two Sorcerers -,AFunnyThing-,gametales,https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ew7ed/two_sorcerers/,"A long time ago,
when all of those men who live today's fathers were not even sperm in the sacs of their fathers, there was an orphaned elf by the name of Aza Alarin.
The orphaned elf was an apprentice for an apothecary in Greendale, and spent most of his days cleaning up, begging for change, and taking care of an easily-angered old drunkard by the name of Thaadius Winsor. In exchange for a place to stay and food in his belly, he would play the part of housekeeper and glorified slave in the unbridled hopes of one day learning a trade he really had no interest in (but beggars can't be choosers, now can they?).

One fateful morning, Thaadius Winsor sent delivery to the Elvish City Fort Lheao in the providence of the Seanchanni in the Southern Wood. The delivery, he marked, was ""of extreme importance"" with promises of lashing the payment out of him if he were to lose it... But promises of recognition if he were to deliver it.
It was a potion meant for a Lord there. A rare, experimental potion that was to cure any wound or ailment no matter how severe.

As it so happened, while travelling through those thickened woods, the youngling elf's ears picked up on sounds from the distance and an uneasy feeling vibrated down his body (the kind which he used to get when his father would cast spells). Curious, Aza diverted from the well-worn path to investigate. There, in the Southern Wood, is when Aza laid eyes upon a most beautiful High Elf, bloodied and surrounded by a pack of dead Dire Wolves.

Then, from nowhere, Aza was drawn on by others whom had heard the noises. Realizing he was just a youngling and the other High Elf was near death, demanded his money, his package, or his life. Deciding that none of those were rather pleasant options, Aza decided to make a third option - using a spell his father taught him to use in dire emergencies, he blanketed the area in a thick fog and dragged the High Elf to safety in the chaos.

Despite warnings, and no repercussions to be had for his inaction, Aza Alarin cracked open the salve and applied it to the wounds on the female. But she did not awaken. For a day and a half he gathered berries and hunted using the little spells he knew, and fed her as best he could. Upon the third day, she would regain consciousness and inquire about the events past. That High Elf would introduce herself as Shival Hakor, married to the Elven King Matrim Hakor.

Aza Alarin introduced himself as the son of Tucker Alarin and explained the events of the last few days.

Shival, being taken aback by the use of magic of a Youngling and the outright generosity he showed for someone he knew nothing of, went with the Young Elf's help to Fort Lheao and sent word for Aza's internship to be released from Mr. Winsor. She, out of her influence as Queen, provided him comfort and a home to live in. After indulging him in the depths of Elvish society once more, she began observing the youngling from a distance to see his actions via magic.

Every night, Aza would sneak out of his room, cast Featherfall to land quietly, and climb up the side of one of the taller buildings to count the stars and weave spells... Seemingly out of the blue with no words nor materials.
He would then return to the bottom of the window, cast a spell to throw himself up again, and pull himself into the window and sleep the next day.

One night, Shival Hakor invited the young Aza to her observatory to view the stars and to cast magic. When she inquired about his skill, he remarked that his dad and his family had always been able to use magic. And, when remarked about the stars, he said:

*""My mother always told me that the Stars were those we loved watching out for us from the afterlife. Every man and woman is a star. And, as they gaze upon us, we should gaze upon them.""*

Finally understanding the plight that the boy faced, and inspired by the child-like innocence when it came to magic, she sent to her husband that she would return with the Youngling for a period of time to the Ignis Faatus, the Magical Guild that sat upon the tower at the top of the Laboo Wilderness. After a weeks' ride, they became known at the magical guild and she settled him in with the finest instructors known in the realms, then resumed her position as a sitting adviser to the then-head of the Ignis, River Delphinius.

And from there, time and time again, wars would be fought and won - or lost - and evil would rise and fall. As Aza grew up and as Shival Hakor eventually resumed her name as Shival Felwind, he slowly became attached to the woman whom had changed his life.

Nothing came to fruition until the second time Aza Alarin would save Shival Felwind's life: The day the Abyss was nearly opened and those beings that haunt the chaos of Xel nearly slipped out and infected the world with Chaos.

During the fight with the Unholy Order of Xel (a cult dedicated to opening a gate to Xel and releasing Chaos unto the world) Shival Felwind became surrounded by the chaotic energies, herself defenseless since she was maintaining a spell to keep the gate sealed. Aza, the once-youngling now younger elf, waded through the corrupting energies and cast a ward about them both. The energies would eat at the muscles on his legs, making him eventually fall from his feet but maintaining the spell all the while.

After the battle was over, and the Chaos dispelled, Aza collapsed. This time, he was the one awakening later and asking about what time had been lost.

Shival Felwind was not there, for it would be inappropriate of a High Wlf of her position to show bend toward any common elf, but one of the Healers at the Ignis said that she had spent every night at his bedside - but not to tell her that because he was content with keeping his eyes open and working late (for whatever reason, Aza didn't ask nor did he care). But, as Aza tried to rise, he noticed that his legs failed him and that he could not walk on his left one.

He was told that the corruption permanently disfigured him, and that there was nothing that could be done. He would never use that leg again.

After hours, when a hushed silence would fall upon the infirmary and darkness would veil the eyes of sleeping mages, he would close his eyes and listen with his Elvish ears. Each night, a familiar shuffling of feet would resound and sit beside his bedside. And, each morning, they would leave. He had no doubt in his mind it was Shival, but he would never confront her about it.

One day, Aza Alarin would awaken to an unusual site. Someone had left him a specific object at the base of his bed: an animated rag-doll in his likeness. Aza smiled, knowing of only one enchantress who could weave life like that magic into fabric in imitation of life.

When he confronted her later on, Shival called him a fool and asked him:

*""Do you want to be a star so badly that you'd kill yourself for it?""*

To which Aza replied:

*""I find life much more bearable being the star looking down upon you than you the star looking down on me.""*

And that was the moment when Aza looked out into the stars for a moment, contemplating life and its meaning, when he first received a loving embrace and a gentle kiss from Shival Felwind.

From then on, no matter what the situation arose, she and he would hold that moment in time as pivotal moments in their lives. Aza would fall in love abroad and bare children, Shival would marry multiple times - both would fight wars and destroy evil that threatened the world... But, they would always share that moment and several others like it. Hidden from the world and in secret:

An Elf and a High Elf. Two Sorcerers."

Age: 20  
Bust: about 42 in a bra, depending on whether I'm breathing in or out  
Underbust: about 34, again depending on breath  
Waist: 33  
Hips: 45  
Inseam: 29 if I'm measuring correctly?  
Body type: Hourglass according to the FFA-approved calculator

Me now: I have never really paid a huge amount of attention to my clothes. I just wear jeans and loose t-shirts pretty much every single day. I buy my jeans at Target or similar and my t-shirts online. Even the internship I'm doing this summer has a uniform of a t-shirt and shorts, so I've never really had to look nice. It doesn't seem to be asked for in the official guide, but I'm about 205 lb and roughly a size 14, though obviously clothing sizes are not standardized.

What I'm looking for: I'm going to study abroad in Martinique next semester, and I'm a little worried about fitting in and the like because it seems to be a very fashionable island. I really have had next to exposure to fashion magazines or anything, so I'm most basically looking for advice on **what kinds of clothes are best for my body type**. Or even colors.

More specifically, since I'm going to a pretty hot climate, I guess I should be looking towards light sundresses and skirts. I don't even know how to choose a skirt and shirt that go together, let alone something that is flattering on my body type. You definitely don't have to limit it to that, though. I'll certainly be wearing pants as well, though it seems shorts are frowned upon in Martinique. I'm sorry I don't have the clothing vocabulary to really even properly ask for advice. I'm not really trying to look hot or anything, just well dressed enough.

Budgetwise, I'm probably not going to spend more than $30 on any one piece of clothing.

Aaaand, [photos](http://imgur.com/a/IHtPc). All except the last were just taken. Sorry about the bad image quality; using my laptop's builtin camera. the first outfit is pretty typical, though I'd probably wear jeans more often than shorts. Second outfit the shirt is tighter than I typically wear, though I do sometimes. Third outfit is the only dress I own. Last photo is from a year ago, the closest to full-body I can find among casual photos.

I'm from the Chicago area, within easy distance of a lot of department stores (Macy's, JC Penny's, Nordstrom, Kohl's, Marshalls, etc.). I'd very much appreciate links to specific types of outfits if you have them (especially if they're on girls about my size), but obviously that's not necessary. And I don't mind advice hair and stuff if you like. I don't wear makeup and am probably not planning to start.

My major was math and my summers were spent doing REUs. In other words, I know how to code... but I've never worked for someone writing code before.

I somehow landed a really high-paying job as a software developer, and I'll be starting in a bit over a week. While I'm usually really confident in my abilities, I'm mentally freaking out right now. I'm just afraid I'm going to get there and not be able to accomplish anything. The high pay makes it worse. I'll be getting paid more than either of my parents. I feel like I should be coming in there and just destroying every problem they give me with this compensation, like the Wolf from Pulp Fiction, but I doubt that will be the case.

I'm afraid I'm going to look at this massive codebase, bigger than anything I've ever seen before, and not be able to figure out how the most basic things work. I'm afraid they're going to ask me to make some simple database tweak, and I won't know how because I've never taken a databases class.

I mean, on some level I know I shouldn't worry, because they interviewed me in detail and they know what I know and what I don't know. I didn't hide anything in the interview. At the time I had never used SQL and told them as much. They didn't seem bothered by it since I was able to come up with a solution to the problem without using SQL on the spot.

Still, I'm really suffering from a bout of imposter syndrome right now. How many questions should I be asking my coworkers? I don't want to be that guy who is constantly nagging his coworkers, but at the same time I would absolutely hate to waste highly-paid time not getting anywhere.

I'd really appreciate any tips on the sort of expectations I should have and how I should approach these challenges my first week."

1evw9c,3,2013-05-23,I was fired today and an unpaid intern who starts on Monday will be doing the work I currently do. Wrongful termination or not?,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1evw9c/i_was_fired_today_and_an_unpaid_intern_who_starts/,"I was fired from my company today, a bootstrapped startup with limited funding (I live in New York City...home of 'at-will employment'). They have asked me to come into the office for the rest of the week (Thursday and Friday) to tie up loose ends and pass off everything I've been working on. The reasoning behind my termination that my boss gave was: 1) Poor time management (projects taking longer than he thought was needed) and 2) Arriving at work late (5-20 minutes late 80-90% of the time...I'm not a morning person). He said that in the eyes of our investors, the money used to pay my salary could be better spent on hiring an additional developer (our development team is seriously under-staffed).

I'm unhappy, but I accept all of that. However, I am a designer and my company currently employs 2 designers and there is enough work that needs to be done in order to keep both of us busy every day. One person could not complete everything without working many hours of overtime.

This coming Tuesday, an unpaid design intern will begin working for the company. The intern will be doing work/projects that I had previously been doing. Although my termination may have been for some justifiable reasons, I believe that the I was fired when I was because the work that needs to be done could not be accomplished without 2 designers and the incoming unpaid intern will take on much of the work that I have previous been doing. One could easily argue that this intern's job/internship is illegal for violating the Fair Labor Standards Act (displacing a regular employee) but does the timing/circumstances of my termination constitute wrongful termination as well since my duties are being displaced by an unpaid intern?"

**How I f-cked up:**

* Graduated with my bachelor's in advertising, but opted to pursue a career in my hobby: graphic design.

**My situation now:**

* 2.5 years of experience as a 'graphic designer', multiple paid internships and freelance work.

* Severly underemployed. Hell, I might as well be unemployed. 

* Can't even get a retail job or work at Starbucks to save my life. The last time I landed a retail job, it was only part time for $10/hr which covered nothing but my travel expenses TO that job.

* Drowning in debt. $65k student loans/medical bills ($34k of which are private loans. They are killing me as they cannot be deferred like the federal ones.) I've exhausted my savings and used up all my forbearance time on them, except the federal loans.

**Why am I going back?**

* My portfolio sucks. All of my internship experience has been in production roles, churning out templates and correcting horrible existing designs. After doing this for so long, I feel my creativity has been killed. I hardly create anything good these days.

* While I am able to get small jobs from local businesses, my ability to work full-time at a great agency or get better paying clients is limited by my current skill level (and horrible portfolio)

* I need to get my private lenders off my back for a little bit.

**Two ideas:**

* Go back for a A.S. degree in graphic design - Only because I already have the experience, but need solid training and work to fill my portfolio. The CC I'm applying to has a required co-op program that places students in corporations during their studies. Considering I already have my bachelor's, I would only be in for about a year. I figure this route would get me closer to landing a stable job to pay my bills.

-or-

* Go back for a A.S. degree in computer science - I'm interested in web development, but I'm wary of throwing away my design experience. However, there are many corporations around here that have large IT departments. There is also a co-op program for this degree as well.

**Which of the two seems more practical? Or are they both foolish?**

I started out majoring in CS, but my love has always been in Mathematics, so after speaking with a few professors and my advisor, I decided to change my major to Mathematics with a minor in CS. I feel like I've made a huge mistake.

I've applied for a ton of internships (started looking very early, since December 2012), and I've been turned down so many times because of my major. I was able to get past the screening process in more than a few applications, only to be greeted with ""What does mathematics have to do with CS?"" or ""Sorry, but you don't have enough experience for this position."" or the dreaded email ""Sorry, but we are pursuing other candidates at this time."" 

So I push on, and continue to apply for internships (QA specifically, but at this point I've been applying for anything remotely related software development). Many have given me the advice to apply for QA internships, or just straight internships. Applying for actual jobs, which I've been doing as well, have also resulted in ""Sorry, but you haven't graduated yet, and we need somebody fulltime."" or ""Sorry, but you just don't have enough experience."" 

After months of being rejected, one after another, I wonder if I've been marked ""unemployable"". I'm living on savings, and those savings are about to run out. I don't really have anyone to turn to for financial help. I've gone to the unemployment office looking for ANY kind of work, I've applied for office work, data entry, gas stations, and grocery stores. I've applied to literally everything in my area. I tailor my resume to each application, I have a nice cover letter, I've been to the career center on campus, and I still feel like everything I'm doing is just a waste of time. I really don't know what to do anymore.

I'm writing this as this is my last ditch effort in seeking advice for work. I really am passionate about development. I've taken a few Java courses, and I've done quite a few projects while taking these courses. I feel pretty confident in myself. I just need to get my foot in the door.

TL:DR I'm struggling, and I really need your help.

I will get credited as the creator of the content, and after a set amount of time if they choose not to use my ideas then the rights go back to me, but if I profit off of them then i get 85% while the company gets 15%

Is all of this fair/standard? Part of me is just glad that I'll be getting anything. I need to make sure that this is a fair amount. Should I try for more? Does anyone have other experiences similar to this?

I should note that I get paid a small stipend per month so I'm not on the clock per se when I create the ideas."

Currently, I commute an hour and 15 minutes to my job that I got when I graduated. I make $45,000 salary at the moment, been there since January. At the time I accepted, money was a big issue that motivated me to take the position before applying to a large number of places. I don't want to sound ungrateful, because I know there are a lot of graduates looking for work. I feel like I'm underpaid as I can barely find a decent apartment and pay all my bills with what I'm making. The commute is terrible and I feel like I'm stuck. However, I'm doing well and everyone's happy with my performance. I like what I do and the people I work with, but I don't see a raise happening anytime soon as it's a smaller company.

A relocation plan where I would work 3 days at my current job location (Monday-Wednesday), and 3 days at another location that the company is working at (Thursday - Saturday). The secondary location they said i'd be under a different company name (one letter changed in their name), which I would have to live in an apartment those days and carpool to work and getting to that location and back.

The thing I'm concerned about is that they'd be well overworking me, for me to still be employed as an intern I have to work at least 20 hours a week and less than 39. There is no way for them to have me working at both places and be under 39 hours so I think that with their (slightly altered) company name they will make me work over 40 hours total between the two places, I won't get paid overtime, and I'll still be considered an intern. Plus I don't want to get worked to death, I have a life outside the company.

This makes me worried because it has left me with the idea that as an adult I will not have as much time to do the fun things I currently do in my typical 20-year-old college student life, and as a result, will become unhappy. I fear that my life will turn into one giant routine and that I will end up feeling like the cliched corporate slave (think when Mr Incredible works at his day job). I try to find comfort in telling myself that once I grow up, all of my friends will be doing the same thing, so even if I could keep up my current lifestyle I would just become bored since I would have no one to hang out with.

1evg5n,14,2013-05-22,"Proposing/Introducing a centralized and transparent bitcoin ""bank"" tentatively called ""minisats""",minisat_maker,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1evg5n/proposingintroducing_a_centralized_and/,"**Introduction and Overview:**

I am beginning a project I would like to dedicate my time to. It will be open-source, welcoming both forking and contribution. I believe it will serve an unimaginable number of uses. This might be a bit of a wall of text, but I'd rather be clear than catchy. I'm looking for any criticism, comments, questions, and contributions. **There's a TL;DR at the end.** Here's the idea:

At the most basic level, I'd like to create an open-source, totally-transparent, provably secure and trustworthy anonymous bitcoin bank. As awesome as it is to have the first peer-to-peer success of Bitcoin's magnitude, there are SOME innate perks to a centralized system that we can harness. I believe that if we built a centralized system that was *provably* open and just wrapped it as closely to the Bitcoin ideals as we could, we could get something pretty cool.

A user goes to the site. They request a new account, and two things happen. First, it generates a deposit address for them to send bitcoins to; second, it asks for an address they own. In order to do anything with the bank, they have to send both the command and the *signed* command to the bank. In this way, the user can control their account without ever revealing their private key to anyone, even the bank. The process may seem a little awkward, but this is designed to be securely handled by a trusted client-side program.

**Tips:**

Once the account has funds, you can send a tip to any other user. You can also send to any Bitcoin address, which will create an account for that address and just hold the funds until someone with the corresponding private key does something with them. A tip is instantaneous and irreversible. A tip consists of:

- An amount of bitcoins, with more precision than a satoshi. A transaction can deal with millisatoshis, microsatoshis, etc. I'm using the umbrella-term ""minisats"" for the sub-satoshi denominations.

- A memo, which would support an html-like markup language, capable of referencing other tips, other accounts, or just a general link. It will support small messages or links to larger media.

- (further on in development) ""custom tip behavior"", which will be modeled after [bitcoin contracts](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts). Contracts are currently dormant in the Bitcoin protocol, but offer some really interesting tools.

Each tip will cost a **very** small amount of minisats: something more comparable to a coin's ridges rubbing off after use than a credit card's transaction fees. This will be targetted to exactly pay off the server cost of managing the new information. It's hard to articulate the scale I'm talking here, but you'd have to be sending an insane number of tips for this to affect you in any significant way, and will be far, far less than the transaction fee associated with using the Bitcoin network directly. At the same time, it will basically prevent a ddos attack or spam from being ""worth it"" from the spammer's perspective.

**Data Analysis:**

There will be an exposed interface for viewing the tip history database, possibly just as simple as exposing part of an sql SELECT statement to the user. This will also be designed as a backend for other open-source tools built to access it. To run queries, a user must use an account with some small balance; queries will require some small amount of minisats again targetted to exactly pay off the rough cost of the query in terms of server processing time. This will encourage optimized queries over data-combing; a programmer with a bit of time should always find it affordable to run simple queries even if monolithic entities are running huge data-combing operations. The price will scale along with server demand, so we are always at peak perfromance without crashing. (I'm also considering publicly logging all data searching; what do you guys think about this?)

The culture surrounding this data availability will be like Facebook or Myspace, in that all of the information you could find has been uploaded with the understanding that it was public. This will, by the way, be an excellent way of demonstrating to new cryptocurrency users exactly what ""public yet anonymous"" means, and show them the ins and outs of this new set of rules and consequences.

**Example applications of data analysis:**

Consider the following algorithm that a client could perform:

Given an account id, it will find its biggest sent tips, return the info (from id, to id, amount, memo), limiting by saying something like ""activity last week"". Then take that pool of accounts, and repeat the process with their combined tips matching similar criteria. Continue for some small number of loops.

Now fill in the blanks with some examples. The account was your neighbor Joe's public account. Oh, he donated to that space program. Oh, he sent a few millisats to some other dude with the memo ""for homegrown carrots. tasted great, thanks!"". When the loop iterates again, you'll be reading about your acquaintances' biggest public expenditures. No matter how many loops you iterate through, you're always guaranteed a real person, not a spammer, because you're only getting to people who have done something to receive a tip from someone you trust, at least vicariously. Imagine knowing in an instant every restaurant review your friends have ever had in an instant by only searching the memo field for ""restaurant"", ""food"", or ""delicious"", and specifying only 2 or 3 degrees of separation. Imagine searching instead for the keywords ""amazing"" ""vacation"", and ""travel"", and letting it iterate through a few degrees of separation. Great travel ideas, just like that, pre-sorted in terms of how much your friends vicariously valued the comment. It will be like a subreddit for your life.

I'm sitting at home, up late becuase I can't sleep, and bored. My stoner friend calls me up and says he REALLY needs some pizza but he can't DRIVE and he has some BITCOINS that could be mine. I'm bored anyway, and I could use some more money, so I accept. When I get back home, I see he's tipped me with the memo ""that pizza was awesome. thanks for the delivery man"". A day or so later, I see I've received a tip (maybe with no money, maybe with a few microsats, maybe more) with the memo ""I see you delivered pizza last night super late. Would you mind delivering to my address for XX bitcoins/satoshis?"" He explains that he knows my stoner friend's friend, and he came across the first tip when searching for ""pizza delivery"". If the price is right, I agree. If not, I ignore it or make a counter-offer. And suddenly, with no effort on my part, I have the opportunity to begin delivering pizzas for profit.

Find yourself often killing time in town? Start taxiing your friends around for bitcoins, and soon their friends will be calling you up for rides. No money to pay for food tonight? I bet you could find someone who'd pay you to mow their lawn or shovel their driveway. Start with your friends, and branching out will be easy, with almost any line of work. If you do what you're good at people will pay you to do it again, and specialization will become as natural as breathing.

And beyond things that are just convenient for you to do, consider all the things that you *like* to do. Let's say that you like working with small [quadrotos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrotor), so you get one and start messing with it. One day you are able to program it to do something cool, so you make a video and post it somewhere associated with your account. If your friends think it's cool, they'll tip you for it, which both funds you *and* makes *their* friends more likely to hear about it. The cooler your video is, the more money you get from it, first from friends and then from strangers--and one day you could find that you have an ongoing crowdsourced fundraiser, moving enough money to you to buy a few more quadrotors and start working on [something like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp89tTDxXuI). The sky is the limit with this kind of growth, and the better you are at it the better this will work. And besides the money you'd get, you can browse the tips with any number of algorithms, finding the most constructive criticism quickly in the same way you can do so on Reddit.

This kind of thinking applies to *anything*. I believe that one day, with Bitcoin, restaraunts will fall to the people who just like to cook; specialty book stores will fall to people who like weird books; schools will fall to tutors and apprenticeships. I think this tool is the next step toward that. Why go to college for an engineering degree when you could instead just find and pay an engineer to let you shadow him for a day/week/month? Why take an internship when you could just impress that guy with your knowledge? If you pay attention and you're a smart kid, one day you'll find that he's willing to pay you to show up to work and tell him what you think. Why would an engineering firm hire a graduate when they've seen that your mentor (their associate through some degrees of separation) tipped you a significant portion of a payment for catching an important detail? All you have to do is do what you love as long as it's worth your time, and you'll find your place in the world.

I could go on and on about the amazing things this system could do, but if you're still reading this then you probably get the basic idea by now. I'm mainly posting here because I could use some help, and I'm hoping that this idea is exciting to someone else who can contribue to parts of the project that I'm less able to.

I can immediately start on the database manipulation and bitcoin handling, and when that's done I'm going to start on a basic AJAX interface, assuming no one has already begun making better interface tools. If anyone else is interested in contributing their skills, we'll need:

*At least one cryptology expert

*People willing to work on interface tools; on one hand the database searching, and on the other hand the tip/account management. I'd also like to see a basic tool that handles them both.

It would really help to have:

* Some well-known community member(s) getting involved to more easily prove project honesty/openness.

* Other people setting up their own servers with variants to see which systems and settings work better

* More ideas on how to make this *provably* honest and open. It will be trivial to prove the server *has* been honest, but I haven't yet figured out to prove that it *will* be honest.

* Users, ideally with friends to bring in to start building networks and dialogues.

* Finally, if you love this idea but can't help with ability or time, bitcoins are of course always welcome. I can coast for a while and dedicate my time to this project, but one day bills will come to take me away from this. You can bitcointip me, or my bitcoin address is 17BrEsAs2TY5PkgcyPWyNt2AyenBNTPcJr; depending on the activity of this project, tips will either go toward hiring more talent, tipping good contributions, or paying for my next batch of top ramen and internet bills. Keep in mind that if you'd rather not depend on my honesty, you can always find some other contributor to donate to. Once the ball gets rolling a bit more, I'm sure we'll set up a general donation address.

Alright guys. Sorry for the wall of text. I hope some of you get as excited about this as I am. I'm going to be watching this and responding when I can, and unless the feedback is such that the idea changes rapidly, I'm going to start on the project either today or tomorrow.

**TL;DR: Minisats will be a centralized but 100% transparent online bitcoin bank capable of regular-sized or incredibly small micropayments with memos called ""tips"", and the tips database will be searchable to an extent that will allow an incredible range of uses and, I truly believe, usher in a new era of social interaction like we can't imagine.**"

Walking distance to many bars, restaurants, and two grocery stores.  1st floor unit, 3 bedrooms, living room, bathroom, kitchen with dishwasher, oven, microwave, plenty of cooking utensils, and free laundry in the unit!  Landlord lives on the second floor of the house, and is very responsive.  No smoking and no pets.  If you have a car, we have one available spot in the driveway and no permit is needed to park on the street!

The Roommates:  I'm a graduate student, working a full-time seasonal job and starting an internship in the fall.  The other roommate works full-time as a radiology technician at a local hospital.  I like watching movies, video games, reading, and music.  The other roommate likes skateboarding, surfing, and camping.  We are both laid-back and clean.  We both like to hang out, drink a couple beers and watch a movie together, but enjoy our alone time as well.  As I mentioned before, we all have individual leases.  The other roommate will be here until the end of February 2014, and I will be here until the end of April 2014.

You:  In your 20s, grad student or employed full-time (landlord will ask for references from your current employer and a previous landlord).  You should be able to pay bills on time, and be willing to keep the common areas of the apartment clean.  We have no gender preference, and are LGBTQ friendly."

I already have my BSW. I'm afraid that a multitude of things will prevent me from being accepted.

My first internship was a bad fit for me. Essentially I was put in an office with 40ish people I didn't know (it's very difficult for me to adjust in situations like that), and was expected to figure everything out on my own. I had a supervisor who was also a department supervisor, but being a Child and Family Services office, I was expected to shadow caseworkers. I was never assigned to one particular caseworker, and as a result, I never saw a family more than once. I was also competing with shadow time with 6 new-hires, and because they were actually getting paid, they got higher priority. At my midpoint evaluation, I was railroaded. Issues that I didn't know were issues were brought to my attention for the first time and instead of being given the opportunity to fix them, I was asked not to come back. They later lied to the school faculty about the incident and as a result of everything, I was made sign an ethics/internship agreement or something of that nature in order to continue in the program, because the faculty refused to consider my side of the story.

Needless to say, I don't trust any of the faculty to write me a recommendation for acceptance into a Master's program, which is required in almost any program I've looked into. Is there anything I can do about this? 

I've been out of school since Dec. 2011. Since then I've had a job working as a staff at a juvenile rehabilitation center (something that didn't require a degree) for 3.5 months from May-September 2012 and have been working as a TSS since Nov., but will be laid off at the end of the summer due to lack of work. Neither place I could see giving me a letter of recommendation either: I quit the rehabilitation center on bad terms, and I don't have any single consistent supervisor at my TSS job that I feel could adequately recommend me for something so serious. I have some non-social-work-related bosses that I feel could give me a decent recommendation. But would they be taken as seriously as a supervisor in a human services job?

I'm just at a loss as far as securing a steady job goes. I've been trying since I graduated, and now that I'm being laid off from my TSS job for the summer due to lack of work, I really need to find something more consistent. I rarely get call-backs from jobs where I'm very adequately qualified. I wanted to work before going back for my Master's, because I figured work experience would make up for my less-than-stellar GPA. But I can't find a decent job to get that work experience. I'm dreading of going back to my $8.40/hour summer job at an amusement park for the 8th year in a row because I can't find a job for what I studied for. And I'm afraid of getting a non-degree related job (i.e. warehouse, etc job that only requires a HS diploma) because I would take myself away from gaining experience that would help me get that job I can't seem to get otherwise. Or that could help me get into a Master's program.

I'm sorry for this rant. I'm just so lost and am so beyond frustrated that I just can't get a job in what I studied for."

the first thing was i was getting eye pain... the next day it was eye pain + headaches. i used to get headaches as a chile, but i have not had any (other than the infrequents) for around 9 or 10 years. i have had a running headache for the past 4 or 5 days now, which comes and goes in waves... it will let up for an hour and then come back even stronger. yesterday, i had very bad stomach pains as well. so bad i had to leave my job early, come home, take 500 mg of naproxen sodium and go to bed at around 3:30 pm. for the past 3 days, my urine has been a very dark color. yesterday being the worst. looked like someone left a family sized tea bag in the toilet for a good while...

now, i HAVE been drinking slightly less water (as im not biking down here), the first day i had a headache i ignored it, but as soon as i saw my urine slightly darker, i upped the water 2 fold. (i would still say i was drinking more water than the average person though).

it did not help.... the stomache pains came the following day from me drinking more water.

the first week i was here, i was drinking bottled drinks, which makes me think its something to do with the water im drinking. im about to drive to walmart and get a few gallon jugs of water... my room mate never uses the refrigerator water filter, and when i did start drinking form it it tasted a bit funny. i let it run a bit and it cleaned up fairly well. 

so, my question to you guys: do you think the drinking water was the issue? or should i be worried about some illness? also, if it was the water, will switching to bottled fix that? or do you think i caught some pathogen that was lingering in the stagnent water in the fridges piping?"

1ezzer,1,2013-05-24,[20f] Long distance; is he [21m] cheating?,throwaway_far,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ezzer/20f_long_distance_is_he_21m_cheating/,"I [20f] have been dating my boyfriend [21m] for almost 7 months. We attend the same university in the midwest US, and are studying the same major. We recently went long distance over summer break, when I moved back home on the east coast and he moved out to the west coast for an internship. The longest break previous to this 3 month stint was 1 month for winter break. When we were together during college, we virtually spent every day together given all the same classes and groups of friends. We'll be back together for our last year of college. After graduation he is likely to move back to the west coast and work for the firm he is interning with, and I'll go to grad school god knows where.

I've been apprehensive about this summer, I feel like he is making moves and is going to grow and possibly change a bit and I'm scared I won't be good enough for him any more. I've always felt like I put more effort in to communication and showing I care, even though he was the one who pursued me and won me over. 

I've been trying not to text him a ton, and kind of back off and see if he'll notice or miss me and put in more of an effort. When we do talk, he often says he loves me, but seems more interested in talking about everything he did that day, and not listening to me at all. I try to be patient, but maybe I'm too easy on him.

This morning I woke up at 5am my time for work. The previous day, I didn't text him almost the whole day and he never texted me either. He did call twice, after I had gone to bed, but I didn't answer/wake up. I texted him at 5am my time 'sorry, was asleep and missed your calls :/'.

He then calls me, to my surprise, as it is 3am his time and he has work at 9am that day. He is noticeably drunk. He says he went to a bar with his friend/mentor and drank way more than he should have, and couldn't find his way home (he just moved to the city and doesn't know it well). He keeps repeating himself, first saying that he left the bar 2 or 3 hours ago and was just walking around trying to get home, through dangerous neighborhoods. He kept calling himself a fucking idiot and saying he was sorry. He also said at one point 'I just want to cry right now because that might make me feel better' Then he told a story. which was repeated three times amongst the anger/depression statements.

The first two times, the story went that his roommate, who is gay and whom he just met a week ago, asked how being in a straight relationship was. The roommate made some comments on how it's difficult because everyone he dates are in a circle of friends and they are more accepting of cheating. He then said his roommate asked if he was planning on cheating on me. He then insisted he would never cheat on me and that he loves me. He also said 'I only do things with people I'm in committed relationships with'. 

The third time, the story was similar, except at the end he said, 'well it would depend, like maybe if we had a falling out or something'. 

Each time he told the story he had already forgotten he had told it to me previously, and later today he told me he has no recollection of talking to me at all.

His behavior, from the constant self-berating, and profusely apologizing, as well as the cheating conversation, raised flags for me. He is usually very laid back, not too verbally harsh on himself, and doesn't apologize unless it really warrants one. Also the fact that it took him 2 to 3 hours to walk home from a bar in a neighborhood where it couldn't have been 45 minutes away really doesn't make sense to me.

I have never suspected him of cheating before but I've managed to invent a story in my paranoid mind that it would be plausible if it happened. 

Maybe he left the bar really drunk, with someone. Then he ended up at her place, and they had sex. And he left, still very drunk, and got lost on his way home.

He sees my text, and calls me. He is upset with himself, for multiple reasons, and tries to fix it by apologizing and calling himself an idiot. And then he over corrects by making up a perhaps plausible story that makes it seem like him cheating on me is an inconceivable idea. 

Or maybe I'm just paranoid. Do I tell him about the story he told me next time we talk on the phone, sober of course? I'm not sure how to confront my fears without overstepping boundaries. 

I have a trip planned in a little over a month to go and visit him for an extended weekend, which I was excited for but I'm not sure. If there is something bothering him I'll be able to tell, I'm reasonably good at picking up on things in person. This distance thing is where it gets kind of complicated.

How do I go about this? I don't want to be wrong and ruin my relationship and our trust for one another. 

**TL;DR: My boyfriend calls me drunk and tells me an odd dialogue between him and his roommate about the acceptableness of cheating. He sounds notably upset and apologizes a ton during the conversation, and tries to say he would never cheat on me. Bunch of red flags raised.**"
1ezyxt,0,2013-05-24,"Why, why, why, does my library sticker-up the spines of everything on the new book shelf?!",32a44dd,Libraries,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1ezyxt/why_why_why_does_my_library_stickerup_the_spines/,"http://i.imgur.com/tvXmWDD.jpg 


The new book shelves at my library are, to my mind, made pointlessly difficult to navigate.  Every book gets a colored sticker 'nearish' to the bottom of the spine.  I was told that these colored stickers identify the 'shelving period' of the book, so it can be discerned at a glance if a book should be rotated out of the new book sections. Okay, that sounds fine.  It is my understanding that new books get a specific period of time on the new book shelf, though the answer was oddly nonspecific as to how long that is.  I was simply curious about what the colored stickers signified.  Frankly, they don't much seem to like questions.

Above the colored sticker is an incomplete shelving sticker; author last name and 'F' for fiction on the books in the image that I linked to above.  It pretty much is only useful for alphabetizing on the new book shelf.  These two stickers obscure much more of the spine than necessary.  Some books (e.g., 'Western', 'Mystery') get a genre sticker near the top of the spine, taking up even more space.

They are now adding a ""14 Day Book"" sticker to every book on the new book shelf.  A change in policy was made,  and not all books are checked out for the same amount of time any more.  Books from the stacks are checked out for three weeks and I believe they've changed the renewal policy also.  First, I'm not  convinced that some of these changes make much sense, but if I skim over that, why, why, why, would they slap a ""14 Day Book"" sticker pretty much anywhere on the spine?  If a sticker is needed at all for that, which I doubt, it certainly does not need to be slapped on the spine at all.  The usefulness of these stickers, when set against all of the wasted spine space, is dubious.  They make it awfully hard to browse the new books, seeming not to give a thought to readers.

Covers help sell books.  In libraries, spines help sell books.  Help me see what you've got!

As long as I'm on a rant:  If you have a question, the best option is to find one of the their part-time interns  / student employees.  They are almost always happy to help.  There is one exception that I know of, but as a rule the 'professional' staff doesn't like to be bothered.

I went off and on for a few years before realizing I would never finish if I didn't go full time. That being said, I chose electrical engineering on a whim and have since nearly completed my degree. College really intimidated me at first, and my adviser was of little to no encouragement or help when I was signing up for courses. That being said, I didn't choose my courses in the best order and thus have two semesters where I am only taking my senior design 1 &amp; 2. 

Ideally, I would like to work a full-time long term internship which would transform into a job or perhaps even an entry level position would be even better. 

I don't want to sound like a presumptuous jerk, but I feel like I could/should be able to work as an engineer being done with all my academic courses. However, I won't have my degree until December. 

How do I go about the next 6ish months in order to survive and earn a decent wage? Has anyone else been in the same boat? Thanks!

However, this summer I wanted to work in more product design/ medical device R &amp; D (as that is what I want to do). Unfortunately, I applied to a bunch of places and didn't hear back from anyone (my school's office of career development didn't help at all). By the time I thought to throw in the towel and return to my old job for the summer, they were going under and were on a hiring freeze. 

Fortunately I was able to take a research position under one of my professors this summer, it is in medical device research... but its just that... research. I just do literary studies and if I'm lucky... I MIGHT make a CAD model or two.

I currently have a 3.1 gpa (deans list at my school) and I am caught up with all my classes (I typically get good grades, very few C's in my academic career, 3)

My areas of concentration are product design and biomedical engineering...

Heres my question; What can I do NOW To ensure that I'll have a job offer (in medical device design) by the time I graduate? What am I doing wrong?

1ezoye,24,2013-05-24,Talkeetna,Chalqk,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ezoye/talkeetna/,"Each passing minute felt like a pendulum passing slowly back and forth over my body. The air was icy and thick with snow. My heart still is racing just thinking about it. Emptiness. Everything is empty. But let me take you back to where it all made sense still.

December 17th, I've got a one way ticket to Alaska. Looking back I didn't know what I expected to look at more than snow. I hate the snow. I hated it then too but a job was a job, and I needed the money more than ever. A couple months back I had been offered a paid internship to work in Alaska at a hotel and work the front desk. Everything was paid for so I thought, ""What the hell."" and jumped on board the idea.

The plane ride there wasn't anything amazing. Minor turbulence here and there, but nothing too exciting.  Although I did have my doubts as soon as I got on that plane. We landed some time after midnight and the snow was six feet high; I didn't have an easy time finding the hotel. 

Now the hotel itself was privately owned and located just about 40 minutes north of Talkeetna. Now By the time my cab was in Talkeetna, I was beging to doze off but an eeriness crept on me like a poison. As I looked around, i saw nothing but darkness enveloping snow. The only word to describe this place was empty.

I arrived at the hotel around 4:00 am. I walked to the front desk with all my bags to only be greeted again by the feeling of emptiness. Everything was silent. Everything was also dark except for a single light over the front desk. There was no difference between here and outside. The cold was the same. 

After what seemed like two hours I began to snoop looking for someone only to find a man asleep in a manager's booth. It was the manager; his name-tag read, ""Randoll-Manager"". He looked something of about 50 years old, and pale as the snow. I knocked on the door but he did not stir. I opened the door, quietly calling his name but he did not awake. Finally I shook him lightly and he seemed to be coming to. Once I woke him up, he just stared at me with this revolted expression that made him look angrily concerned. 

""I'm the intern. I was told I'd be greeted and taken to my employee room in the last e-mail I got from here."" I spoke softly. His face slowly was beging to calm but his silence was giving me chills. 

""Fine, fine. Yes, come with me."" He seemed to be at a loss of words. He escorted me to my room; the room i would stay in for the next several months but he remained silent for the remainder of the trip. Finally i got into my room and Randoll just disappeared. I thought nothing of it and went right to bed.

The next morning was as cold as the night but the light was comforting. Now this hotel was beautiful, like an actual ski lodge, but much bigger. The views were breath-taking but in the first couple days there was a snowstorm. We didn't get a lot of service the first couple weeks because of the continuous snowstorm, but I was still being paid so I was content. Randoll hardly ever appeared around the hotel and it seemed like it was only him and I on staff. Occasionally people would leave their rooms for the day and come back later that night, or a service man would show up for an hour or two. But other than that this hotel was dead.  

It was in the last week of my first month (January 20th) that things started to change. People checked out, but they never came back. The service men stopped coming and i started seeing less and less of anyone at all. It was just Randoll and I. Alone. Now I got the weekends off but there was really nothing to do with a snow storm around. The food was all packaged for the employees for times like this so we were fine. I wasn't worried at all about the people not coming anymore, it just left me bored with nothing to do at the front desk. 

What started to worry me was that i stopped seeing Randoll as often and he and I never talked. I would just get a check under my door every two weeks. When i stopped getting my checks and Randoll stopped showing up anywhere at all, I was concerned. 

I began to look around again for anyone, or anything like a phone I could use. Even when I found one i didn't know who to call. I kept working, but always looking. About another two weeks went by and there were no signs of anyone in the hotel at all. I had practically memorized this hotel. 

Slowly, things started to seem a little colder and a little darker each day. Once I had missed two paychecks in a row, I decided that I would stop working and find Randoll. I looked EVERYWHERE for that man, but he seemed to always evade me, if he was even there at all. 

I did start to find things though. Subtle, odd things that barely caught my attention like a bike randomly in the lodge. But no this bike was covered in ice. It made no sense, but it gave me hope of finding Randoll after all. The snowstorm began to intensify and there was a low whistle everywhere in the hotel from the wind outside. 

Even once i could have sworn I saw Randoll walking at the other end of the hall then turning into another hall. But when I turned the other hall, there was nothing but an ice born draft on me. That cold draft never left me that day. 

Another couple days passed until I could literally stand it no more. I was going to pack my bags and leave before I got snowed in. It was around 8:00 pm so the sun was still up. Walking to my room I noticed something strange. A door was open. And I heard riffling. I began to approach the open door with caution. It wasn't the smartest idea, but I began to call out. 

""Hey, is anyone there?"" The riffling stopped. ""Hey!"" I began to run to the open door. Without warning a high pitched whine began to sound. I covered my ears and stopped in my tracks. What I saw emerge from the door ever so calmly was a tall (maybe 7 feet) albino human looking creature hunching over another human body. The creature's eyes pierced my mind and snared me. I vomited from the stench and the sheer terror of the beast and began to feel weak and ill. As I began to step slowly backwards. So too did the monster com forwards. 

The light passed over the creature in segments at a time. I had the nerve to run as fast as I could but not the will power. I caught another glimpse of the body the creature was dragging along. Randoll no doubt. I didn't know where else to go but in my room. I vomited again this time being more stomach acid than food. I began packing everything I had brought, while trying to think of a way to leave without crossing paths with it again. I could hear it inching forward a short ways down the hall. 

Every time I thought of it's image I gagged. Once I had everything ready to go in a makeshift packing effort I stood silent to listen. I could hear the creature no more. I waited then for about an hour before I mustered the courage to open my door. My hands were sweaty and shaky and my head was pounding from a headache. I opened my door so silently I even shocked myself. Not long after I poked my head out to check down the hall. Nothing, as usual. The blood on the floor carried on down the hall. It must have been from Randoll. 

I began making my slow and steady escape from this horrific hotel. Once I was out of the hall and into the main entry I felt better. Although I did see the manager room door open. In my better judgement I wouldn't have checked, but a small part of me BEGGED to know why.

I walked over to the manager's room where I showed my flashlight. It made me jump when I saw it, but i immediately felt sorrow. Randoll's lifeless body stared down to the floor. Right. Into. My. Soul. I didn't know him well, or at all for that matter, but he was just a confused old man after all. He still had that stare he always had.

I left and never went back. I don't think I'll ever go back to any places with snow now. They all feel empty."

1ezejb,152,2013-05-24,Just accepted a job offer! Some job search and interview tips that I found helpful along the way.,YCSMD,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ezejb/just_accepted_a_job_offer_some_job_search_and/,"If you are currently in the process of trying to obtain a job, I hope I can give you some pointers and info that really helped me go from terrible at interviewing and not really sure of myself, to killing 8 interviews in 1 day with everyone from the CEO of the company down to the engineers I'd be working with.  The person in charge of hiring mentioned that he was extremely impressed in me and that every single interviewer was too.  Most of these are probably obvious, but too many people don't want to follow them.  

General Tips:  

1.  Apply to tons of places early, and definitely tailor your cover letter for the company if you really want it.  Do not wait for each one to get back to you.  
2.  Use your school's job resources, start early.  They were extremely helpful for me from looking over my resume, giving me guidance early on, and just giving the resources to connect with employers.  It's much easier to get a job while still in college than out of college.
3.  Run your resume and cover letters off friends or family who are good at that kind of stuff.  Pay attention to details.  I bounced my resume off at least 5 people and went through at least 20 revisions since I first worked it up.
4.  Use ACTION WORDS on your resume and make it sound like you did great stuff, even if you didn't.  But don't lie.  One of my internships was a total bust and I hated talking about it, but I spiffed it up and it was actually the reason I landed my job.  The best thing I could say about it was that ""It was a great experience, it allowed me to meet a lot of great people, and I was able to see a whole'nother side of the business which was great for my development because my other internships were heavily engineering based.""  but it worked for the 3 interviewers who asked about it.  I also talked about how it helped develop my report writing and stuff like that (in addition to other things).  In reality I wrote 1 real report, 1 stupid report, went on a few trips with the office, and slept in my office all day otherwise.  My resume essentially goes: Education, Experience, Current Projects, Knowledge.  
5.  Get as many interviews as you can BEFORE the big one that you really want.  After your first two interview, the rest become MUCH easier.  I got an interview at a design company that I really wanted and it went terrible because it was my first interview in a year and was not on the ball.  That means search your job site now and start applying to anything that interests you at all.  Yeah, its stressful, but better than screwing up when it really matters.
6.  Spend time designing your resume.  I actually built mine in Illustrator with the help of my girlfriend and I think it definitely helps show pride in your work over a shitty Word template.  Word actually has decent templates now that will probably work too.  (I may edit it and send it to anyone interested if there's enough interest).
7.  Job fairs suck, I still don't think they actually helped me at all, but go anyways and talk to employers to see what they want.  Try to land an internship/job if you can obviously.  

Interviewing Tips:  Look [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cxpq8/what_are_the_dos_and_donts_of_a_job_interview/c9kyssy) for more info because this post helped me immensely.

1. Dress well. I see so many engineers dressed like slobs with clothes that don't fit or are all wrinkled.  I would be very hesitant to hire them if I were doing the hiring, because it really doesn't speak well of you.  I usually went with a light blue dress shirt, blue tie, black slacks, and dress shoes.  Make sure your pants are well fitting, and worn correctly. Seriously, this is a huge first impression and you don't want to look like a slob.  Don't wear loud stuff like red shirts. It really just looks weird.  
2.  Learn about the company, be ready to talk/ask about their products/services.  That's what most of my interviewing time was actually spent doing after the initial one.  I would just ask one of the many questions I had written down, and LISTEN to their replies, and touch on why you were happy to hear the answer they gave or why that is great for you.  The questions aren't to waste time, they are to show yourself off and allow you to understand the position and company.  Look to the next point to see where many of your questions/answers should in some way point.  
3.  Write down questions you have, why you are the best fit for the job, and why you would hire you, NOW CONVINCE YOURSELF.  Remember the list and read it to yourself because you are the shit going in and you need to convey that.  You are the best person to sell yourself and the only person to sell yourself.  **They are looking for someone who can do the job (easy), is going to work hard, stay with the company, and be a good fit with the employees.**  All your answers and questions should essentially lead back to proving this to them.  
2.  Make eye contact, say their name in the greeting, remember it, and say it in the thank you and goodbye with a solid handshake.  
3.  Ask them how their day has going, instead of awkwardly just walking to the interview room or whatever in silence.  Give them a compliment if you can on their business or maybe something you learned from their site about them.  Be genuine in your compliments.  
4.  Try to be relaxed and have fun.  Yeah, this is a stupid one, but it's important.  If you are having a hard time with this one, you should be getting as many interviews as you can early to work it off.  Sorry.  
5.  Be ready with great things to say about your past experiences.  Write them down and remember them.  Always positive, what you learned, and why that's great for them.  
6.  Talk to someone on the phone or something before going for the interview, convince them why you are excited about the interview.  It will help loosen you up and get you ready.  
7.  You should have some situations in mind for times when you were the leader (Think of a random group project where you acted as the coordinator and be ready to discuss it)

I hope you guys find these helpful because I spent a lot of time on this post!  I really dont mean to sound like a know-it-all; its all basically things that HELPED ME PERSONALLY overcome what was a huge stress in my life.

The most helpful thing for me was to make a notebook and write down why you are a great person, great employee, great fit for the company, etc and convincing myself of it.

Finally get the Dale Carnegie audiobook ""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" and listen to it.  Its possibly just obvious stuff for you, but reinforces some basic fundamentals of winning people over.  The most important I have found to be genuinely complimenting people and saying their name.  People fucking love it.  "
1ezdh1,0,2013-05-24,What do standardized test scores mean?,sand135,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1ezdh1/what_do_standardized_test_scores_mean/,"Throughout my life, my friends have always been much better students than me (I'm a 25m.) I'm a B or B- student, while they're A or A-.

They don't care, because I keep up with them intellectually just as well as the next guy. In fact, most people I meet tend to assume I'm a great student until (and if) they learn otherwise.

However, I can't stop judging myself for it. My friends all beat me on the SAT's by a minimum of 300 points, and on the LSAT by a ton as well.

At internships, they like me just as well as any of my friends, cuz I am a very capable thinker. However, I always get excluded from opportunities - because we live in a world that judges young people by academic proficiency alone.

I have less job opportunities, less educational opportunities; all because of my inability to perform as well in school.

Obviously this shouldn't determine my self-esteem, but I feel like it MUST say something about me that my friends all did super well on the SAT's for example, and I was leagues behind them.

I guess it says a lot that my friends don't judge me for it (clearly they don't think any less of me for it,) but I guess I sometimes think less of me for it.

How can I pretend that my significantly inferior grades doesn't mean I have a significantly inferior brain, when that's what rejection letters and ignored job applications tell me?

TL;DR - All of my friends do way better than me in school and on standardized tests. Does that mean I'm less intelligent/capable than they are?"

1ezb3q,6,2013-05-24,How does my career road map look towards CPA and public accounting?,dzyj,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ezb3q/how_does_my_career_road_map_look_towards_cpa_and/,"Few things about me first. I graduated 2 years ago with a BA in economics. I had a job for approx 6 months as an accounting clerk, even though it was at a bookkeeper level it still gave me a small taste of accounting and between work and the financial accounting classes I recently have taken I enjoyed it and knew this was the career path for me.

My only concern though is that I didn't take advantage of the my previous university's career services while I was going for my econ degree. In addition, my current university which I'm enrolled under their accounting certificate program, doesn't have the largest network/career services for the big 4. How do I make my self noticeable to them?

Finally, since my workload is fairly light right now(wasn't able to get as many classes as I wanted), would it be a smart thing to start studying for the CPA exam so I can take it as soon as I have enough credits to sit for it, even though I haven't taken the necessary classes.

Also when would be the best time to start looking for the big 4? Would they consider me as an intern candidate with only 4 accounting classes under my belt, or would I be better off looking for an intern once I begin sitting/passing my cpa exams?

thank you for the guidance"

I make it less than two months and I start getting a burning in my stomach, go to an urgent care just to hear it could be gerd or ulcers. I wasn't happy but they gave me medicine I FELT HORRIBLE got nauseated had a nurse tells me if that happens go to ER (this is visit number 1). Sit there for hours get some magic nausea pill and I'm feeling alright and they give me some mix of crap that kills the pain for my stomach great! They give me another medicine to try and I'm on my way 6 hours later at 3 in the morning.   
  
Next day I'm so nauseated its worse than before in so much pain I finally fall asleep from exhaustion clutching my stomach. LOW AND BEHOLD its the medicine I deduce and after a second episode of nausea and It hits me a third time and I head to the ER (visit number 2) mind you I am new to my area and I am using the ER and urgent cares because I can't see a Dr. for 2 weeks I am playing a waiting game because no Dr. seems to think its important enough to see me despite how horrible I am feeling. I GET EVEN MORE NEW MEDICINE.

Here is where it gets mildly better the DR we though we had told us the wrong date and if we waited I have to take another week and a half of horrible nauseated nights. We call around find 1 DR that said ""You have been in the ER twice? Can you come in this Thursday?"" hell yes I can and I think everything will be better. Finally see that doc and he does a physical and evaluates me mentions a slight spine curve nothing serious but just adds on the pile said it is probably what causes my back tension. While he does that I keep thinking man my joints have been hurting a lot lately and he says it could be the medicine so get off of it for a few days and lets see. Few nights of nausea and pain and yup its the medicine yet another switch. I get a new one it gives me more problems related to gerd which at this point we thought it wasn't necessarily, like really it caused problems?  
  
Do H-pylori test hoping for an easy answer but noooo can't be that simple for me no luck. At this point I've also had headaches and the Dr is a little concerned which made me really concerned the guy hardly listened to me some times it seems but he was helpful and got me a neruo referral and a gastro.  
  
Well gastro calls to schedule 4 fucking months away I am still waiting till July for this. Neuro schedules but hey doc my face muscles feel tight and so does my right side of body kinda Dr says go to ER to be evaluated ASAP. I do get brain scan no doesn't seem like your dying but its probably tension headaches.  
  
Mind you while all of this is going on so is school I went from not missing a single lecture or anything in an entire year which I was proud of and I'm missing two lectures a week at least. So I have to go out even more and try and catch up in between all of my lab classes and work.  
  
Well back to the DR. between all of that and he throws me on Nexium and if you don't know its the big boy stuff for these kind of problems and its $150 bucks a month which is like a fortune for me between paying rent and other expenses. 

Hurray all the Nexium at least makes me mobile again not more clench over, or may be I'm healing and it is bad ulcers the doc doesn't know and I won't know for months.   
  
In the mean time I am now off to Physical therapy for tension headaches and it kinda pulls the tension to other places and that gives me head aches when I wake up now. I ran out of sample Nexium the doc gave me and I am on day 2 with out it and my insurance didn't authorize it. So I had to wait even longer and literally as I wrote this I got a call that it will be there hallelujah something descent is happening.  
  
To put icing on the cake my fuckin girlfriend the best person in the whole fucking world took care of me with all my sickness and bitchyness that I am sure was there and then she had to leave for an internship for 6 months leaving me in the apartment by myself which with out being sick wouldn't be as bad but has left all but depressed and lonely since friends have gone for the summer and she works a really tight 16 hr schedule at her internship daily where she barely gets service so can't text me often.  
  
And grades came through I should have had all A's but ended up with B's in a couple classes which isn't bad but when the reason is you missed a few points on the final for my calculator fucking up mid test, and the other teacher changed the question HE SAID WAS FOR SURE ON THERE to something else.  
  
Here is to hoping I'm slowly not rotting from the inside out with something horrible as the Drs play the waiting game with me and that 2013 some how turns up (which wouldn't be hard at this point).  
  
And to every god damn person that doesn't get the care they need and have it a million times fuckin worse that I do. I am sorry and I wish every goddamn person the best because I know I am stressed out, and tired, and just wanna be able to walk around with out thinking ""why does this part hurt now?"""
1ez6yg,12,2013-05-24,Should I change my major to CS or do a Professional Masters in CS?,NextTopNerd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ez6yg/should_i_change_my_major_to_cs_or_do_a/,"So I am currently pursuing a BS Accountancy &amp; BS IS/IT with a minor in CS. My original plan was basically get my BS Accy/IT in 2014 and do MS Accountancy for my CPA and ultimately graduate in 2015.

However, all my plans have been thrown to the whirlwind the past couple of years as I have slowly discovered that I love CS and don't really like Accounting (even though I'd say I'm good at it.) So right now, my options are to change my degree altogether, abandon Accounting and stay an extra year to get only BS in CS by 2015 or I could get that Accounting and IS/IT degree, and pursue a professional masters degree in CS and graduate in 2015. 

I have taken the requisite of CS and Math courses to get into the M.C.S program at my university, so I should be fine in that respect. I am also currently doing a CS internship this summer. I am just really confused which option to go by - especially because I know I want a career in CS (either software engineering or databases/data mining), and I don't know if my business background will hold me back from other candidates if I do decide to go with Masters.

Cost wise and time wise, there is not much difference as I was always planning to stay till 2015. I'm just confused about which option would be the best career-wise. Any advice... is there any other alternative that I haven't considered?"

So I am in college and got a raise at my internship so I figured I would celebrate with a little upgrade in the price range of $150-200.  

I was thinking about one of the following:

* adding a second monitor
* adding a second GPU
* downsizing because I am back and forth from college and my case is massive.  I only really move it during winter break and for the summers though so it isn't a huge deal.  

And suggestions on what to upgrade even if it isn't on that short list?  Thanks"
1ez4wc,0,2013-05-24,"Interview question, can someone lend an ear or opinion?",[deleted],Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/1ez4wc/interview_question_can_someone_lend_an_ear_or/,"Hi folks. Just a general question about human behavior and social appropriateness. I went to an interview today for a print production job that would be really helpful to get. Turns out, I kinda know the interviewer in that he used to be a roommate with a buddy of mine. 

I feel like during the interview I didn't really put out my best face due to nervousness. It felt like a weird place between having previously chiefed with this guy and then being formal for an interview (he's a few years older than I am). I feel like it just weirded out the whole thing, I wasn't sure if I should screw around and have fun to show that I'm fun to work with or to be formal and try and show my abilities. I feel that I got to neither to any effective degree, unfortunately. (I understand that I might just be bad at engaging people).

My tech skills are all there and I know I'm capable, but the last job I had I was fired from for smelling like booze. Now please don't judge me, but the place was a hole and the owner was an asshole. I didn't say *that* during the interview because I've always been told not to bring up bad things. However I did say I was fired for smelling like booze a few mornings; I feel like saying the gal was crazy would have worked in my favor, but I did not do any complaining that would probably warrant a bit of reprieve on my part (the place was shit, my work history is squeaky aside from that, but an internship I did before that didn't materialize due to legitimate budget constraints and the short time-frame looks poor)

---

So I know I should write a thank you email of some sort.

Do I write something verbose and try to explain these things to help paint myself better? (I do have lots of awesome references for what it's worth)

Do I just write a really quick ""thanks!"" and that's it? 

I feel like the interview didn't go as well as it could have in that I didn't really open up. I thought of a million questions I should have asked... after I left, and a million things I should have said about myself. The nerves just killed me!

What's the best way to go about this? I'd really like the job and feel like there's some way to use our past acquaintanceship for good but don't want to take advantage of that relationship either. I also know though that I'm more than qualified for the position, but feel that maybe I might not seem like I'm fun to work with, or perhaps I didn't really *show* my abillity (I wasn't even asked to show a portfolio for this, but my portfolio and work history is very highly technical)

I've just been in a big funk since I lost that job. It wasn't even from smelling like booze, it was from the people being nuts and the place being disorganized and me not being able to keep up with shittily recorded orders and having to fix more than what should have been my responsibility. Left me in a total funk, I don't even know what people like anymore?

In my opinion, I should write a pretty good explanation for a few things to help paint myself in a better light, because I just don't think I brought it out. My rationale is that if I was in that position, that is what I'd like someone else to do.

-Also, I want a job like this just to chill for a while with make-the-widget type work while I work on personal art stuff and hobbies and eventually (hopefully) transition into a position doing that, rather than widget work. "

I was a straight A student with many AP credit classes through high school and never had to apply myself. Once I get to college, I started smoking weed. At first it was occasionally, and then it was habitually and often. I maintained a decent GPA (for an engineering student) and I got an internship and a girlfriend. All was well. Also, we have been going out for about 8 months. 

My girlfriend knew I smoked, but was not aware at how frequently. Now, she's not anti-drug as she's smoked and done other ""harder"" drugs with me, but she never wanted to date a habitual user. It all comes crashing down (as I had been hiding my drug use from her) and we almost break up. She felted duped and lied to, and I had my own issues to deal with. We decided that I would clean up my act and work through it. 

I hadn't smoked in months. For the first time in almost 3 years, I could pass a drug test. Some friends had been hitting me up asking if I wanted to smoke recently, and I wanted to test myself whether or not I could go back to using it rarely, or if I had it sitting around I would smoke it again like I used to. Before ever mentioning it to her, I bought some and began my ""test"" to see if I could handle it and be able to use responsibly. Well I had smoked earlier in the day (I wouldn't have smoked before going to see her) and I was still a bit high accidently when she showed up unexpectedly. 

Again, everything came crashing down. I understand that the issue is that we've already done a very similar scenario before, it was hard then, and now I've done something incredibly stupid and brought it back. I went behind her back and did drugs and then lied about it. 

I absolutely love this girl and she's the best thing that could have happened to me. Hurting her by lying was never my intention, I just wanted to find out about myself and where I was. She's too good to have someone that lies to her, and she deserves better. I know at my potential (where I've been the last few months) I can be the right match for her. We're so compatible in so many ways. Is there any way to reconcile this, or am I just too big of a fucking blind, short sighted idiot who doesn't think things through and I permanently fucked things up? 

I've heard from a third party that in the past with previous boyfriends, she didn't always tell them the full truth about who she was hanging out with (other ex's) simply to protect her boyfriend. Like, she never cheated but she didn't want him to be jealous and worry, so it was a white lie. I'm not sure even how true that is to begin with and if I'm just trying to rationalize my shitty immature behavior, or if this is is why I even thought the whole ""behind the back"" thing would be okay (even if it was just temporary)

tl;dr

I fucked up and lied about something important because I thought it shouldn't have mattered and I wanted to test myself. Is there any fixing?"

However, I recently read an article on TNW http://thenextweb.com/eu/2013/05/13/student-and-itching-to-do-a-startup-howd-you-like-to-spend-the-summer-in-silicon-valley/

http://www.startupdreamteam.com/

I applied to this and I'm now accepted to the program, however, I don't have an internship yet (I did post in r/forhire and I'm actively looking around).

It's basically a program where you spend the summer with 45 other entrepreneurially minded students in a house, everyone does their own internship and in the evenings there's workshops and talks, stuff like that.

I'm now really doubting if I should go or not. 

The pros: I'm guessing it's a very stimulating environment, I'll get to know a lot of new people. If I can find a good internship, that's a very good experience. IF... (because it already starts in 3 weeks).

The cons: It's really expensive living there and I don't have a lot of money. The program itself is free but I would still have to pay the rent, flight, etc. I also don't know if the program is worth it. I'm doing pretty well in my home country right now (gaining a lot of experience) so I would leave all of that behind for 2 months...

So.. What would you do?"
1eyxul,2,2013-05-24,Undergrad with questions about admissions/undergrad school,dayne-sword,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1eyxul/undergrad_with_questions_about/,"Hi, I'm a college freshman finishing up my year at a large state flagship. I wanted to know how important an undergrad institution is in grad school admissions. I'm at my current school primarily due to finances; when I applied, my family wasn't doing too hot. Academically, I'm doing great (4.0), double majoring in Math/CS with a minor in Econ.

-I came in with AP credit, got to some mid-upper level courses, and am involved in research with a professor as well (CS prof).  I've done lab internships since HS, and I'm very sure I'd like to go to gradschool and become a researcher.

- Overall, I don't feel satisfied with my school beyond doing 'well' there. I'm happy with my grades, work, etc. but the overall educational expereince isn't what I wanted. I'm not too fond of the atmosphere or size either. Due to this, I've thought of transferring to an overall better school (my school has a strong CS dept, ok math dept, and very weak econ dept). The schools I want to transfer to will have equal CS department strength, and better math/econ departments.

- If I transfer, which would be as a junior, and leave my current instituion- I'd have to ultimately find a new prof to work with. Does having breaks/working with different people matter? I have an REU for this summer, and I'll probably try one for the next. Is research experience in general more important than whatever specific projects you have worked on (as long as they're fairly relevant).

- I'm split on whether I want to go to grad school for Econ or CS. I enjoy both subjects. At my current school, there's research going in CS that I like, but the Econ department isn't doing work in the areas I'm interested in. If I transfer, I could work in areas of Econ I enjoy, and even I end up not enjoying Econ work, I could still continue work in CS areas I'm interested in (which is at all the schools I'm interested in transferring too).

- Ultimately, down the road I may regret not transferring. I have this feeling at the back of my head that I could've gone to a better undergrad. I don't know if this will be bad for grad admissions since I'd sort of have to start over at a new school, though by then I'd have almost 4 years of lab/intern research experience in total. In either case, transfer or not, I'll still focus on gaining skills.

-Thanks!

About us: VouchedFor is a disruptive Start-up in the financial services sector. We like to think of ourselves as the TripAdvisor of independent financial advice. In other words, we let people find, rate and review Independent Financial Advisers and have plans to do a whole lot more.

We’ve already secured partnerships with major industry players, received great press coverage and have the backing of an awesome group of investors with successes like Betfair, Zoopla and Gumtree under their belts.

We’re based in SW London and are currently recruiting two Graduate Interns to join our growing team.

Description: There are two roles up for grabs

Social Media and Communications Intern

Raising awareness of our brand is key to making us grow quickly. Working with our Communications &amp; Marketing Manager you’d be instrumental in devising and implementing campaigns to ensure that VouchedFor becomes synonymous with personal finance. Regular tasks will include:

Social: Write unique engaging blog content; Engage our audiences through social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn); Manage our blogger outreach programme
PR: Develop insightful reports, analyses and infographics; Draft press releases, surveys and pitch stories to trade and consumer journalists
SEO: Develop and manage a link build programme; identify opportunities for on-site optimisation

Business Development Intern

Generating and fostering new relationships as well as building on existing ones within in the industry are key to driving our business forward. Working with our Business Development Manager you will be at the forefront of our B2B efforts, making VouchedFor a must have for every IFA. Regular tasks will include:

Account Management: You’ll be in charge of nurturing relationships with IFA’s and developing new systems to ensure that our growing database runs without a hitch
Onboarding (Just our fancy word for getting advisers up to speed on the site!): VouchedFor is always evolving which means new options and packages for our IFAs. This role involves keeping the IFAs up-to-date with current changes and ensuring they’re on the best package for their needs
SEO: We’ve developed a successful link building programme (you’ll have the keys to the car to make it even better!); identify opportunities for on-site optimisation
B2B Marketing: It’s all about getting our name out there in the industry so you’ll be involved in generating new business through your weird and wonderful marketing ideas.

Above all don’t forget we’re a Start-up so no 2 days will ever be the same. It’s about diving in, coming up with ideas, trying them, figuring out what works, and doing more of it. We’re always open to fresh insights and there is plenty of scope for the roles to evolve. We are all the time.

Salary: Initially we’ll be looking to pay National Minimum Wage but for the right candidate we’d hope to turn this into a permanent salaried role. However, if you’re set on joining a blue chip and using us as a stepping stone we’ll be happy to have helped you on your way.

About you: You’ll have graduated from a good University and be dedicated, full of ideas, happy to get involved and give things a go. We’re looking for analytical minds, so you’ll be adept at identifying issues and solutions and spotting opportunities, and how best to maximise them. Both of these roles have huge potential to grow, and the right people will be instrumental in helping to shape our business. An interest in personal finance and/or relevant work experience would be a bonus but not essential as we’ll be here to get you up to speed.

Most importantly... How to apply?

We’d like to see your CV, but just as importantly we’d like to know why you’d like to work with us. So ditch your usual blurb and let us know in one sentence, maybe two, why you’d like to join the team… Bonus points for originality!

You must have full entitlement to live and work in the UK.

1eyrh3,19,2013-05-24,[Intro] Hey everyone! I found this subreddit recently and thought it was a great idea.,Kafke,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/1eyrh3/intro_hey_everyone_i_found_this_subreddit/,"I gotta say. Seeing subreddits like this and others similar is pretty amazing. I never thought I'd see people online gifting to complete strangers. I've done some gifting myself (through twitter, /r/playitforward, and other various sites), and found that it's actually pretty fun to see others reactions.

So... A little about me: I'm a 20 Y.O. college student who's close to graduating. I'm a computer science major and spend a lot of my time making and playing video games. I'm more of a Nintendo fanboy, and I like their consoles/games over the compeition. I'm currently playing through Kingdom Hearts DDD on my 3DS (I love that little console).

I'm also a fan of anime. I frequent /r/anime and I keep track of everything through [my anime list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Kafke). I like a wide range of shows from action stuff like Death Note and Baccano! to more light hearted shows like K-On! (yes, I'm one of those people).

I don't know how much I'll be able to gift right now, seeing as most of my money is going toward living costs and school costs. But I'm working on getting an internship over the summer and will hopefully be able to gift some people.

So... Any one else here like games and anime? Is anyone into computers and programming? General interests?

And finally... Did I do my flair/wishlist right? I'm somewhat new to Amazon and hadn't really messed with the wishlist system much. Hopefully I did it right."
1eyptp,2,2013-05-24,Applying to jobs that require experience?,Cualer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1eyptp/applying_to_jobs_that_require_experience/,"Hiyo! I'm a recent mechanical science (materials science and engineering design) who's looking for entry level work. Like the recent grad that recently hit the main page, I lack direct experience from an internship so it's been hell looking for entry level work.

However, I have worked on several research projects and am currently learning new mechanical tools and equipment, such as CNC's, use of a laser cutter/engraver and 3D printing, which may prove to be beneficial. I've also become proficient with machine shop tools and can prototype projects from conceptualization in a 3D modeling environment all the way to a milled product.

So my question is that there have been posts recommending job seekers to apply for gigs that may not qualify for (requiring more experience than they currently have), but how would you justify yourself when an interviewer or hiring manager asks about it? Maybe sell it in a cover letter, or explain how you're as capable as an experienced individual? "
1eypp2,11,2013-05-24,My First Mania,BigBallinGPR,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1eypp2/my_first_mania/,"This is the story of my first bout into mania.  I just want to share to see if anyone has had any similar experiences.
It’s been five days since the music festival and I still can’t sleep.  I’ve already purchased my tickets to go see Bassnectar perform again a few months and 600 miles from now.  I’ve been continuing to go to work at the semiconductor company where I’m an engineering intern and I can’t stop coming up with amazing ideas to pursue in regards to production control fixes.  This upcoming weekend is a four day weekend due to the fourth of July and I can’t wait for it to come.  I get off work after another amazing day at the office and proceed to head home as usual.  I am so excited to go cliff jumping tomorrow that I can’t contain my excitement.  I start jamming out to the music I’m listening to at the light and proceed to get weird looks from the car next to me.  I laugh and continue jamming, really, really hard.  
I make it home and proceed to head to my office where I’ve spent the past few days and nights watching videos on youtube and reaching out to the people who’ve created them, offering my opinions on their material as well as commending their dedication to their videos.  I spend the next few hours doing the same and eventually realize that I need to eat dinner.  I start cooking spaghetti and realize that there’s a ladybug on the ceiling.  I feel as though this is a sign for the upcoming fun tomorrow and pay close attention to what the ladybug is doing.  It starts walking on the light fixture above me and I start to count how many squares it’s traveled on the plastic covering of the light.  14.  I make sure to remember this number as it’s sure to help me in my adventure the following day.  I finish cooking and eat my well-made spaghetti, it’s delicious.
After cleaning up the dishes, I go back to the office and make the stark realization that chairs are evil and that I shouldn’t be using one.  Chairs promote a sedentary lifestyle that I can’t even imagine living at the moment and it bothers me to be in the same room as one.  It goes out into the living room.  The ladybug has followed me into this room, I take this as another sign that the number 14 is going to be vastly important.  I start to listen to music on soundcloud and play a song by NitGrit called “The Awakening”.  I remember that there’s a video someone made to it and proceed to watch it:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wcv5sfiuQU
Its super trippy and I somehow feel connected to it, that the ladybug who is on the ceiling is somehow trying to tell me about life lessons.  After it finishes, I start to scribble everything that comes to mind down on my dry erase calendar on the wall.  To me, everything is interconnected and makes perfect sense.  I draw one line from a realization to another, thinking of the ways these things interconnect and are meant to be.  I’m a genius.  The rest of the night continues on, with me listening to more music on soundcloud and writing the artists, telling them how I want to start a music label and that they should hit me back if they’re interested.  
The morning comes and my friends arrive for our trip out to the waterfall where we’ll be cliffjumping and swimming.  I still haven’t slept.  I show them all of the amazing connections on my calendar and proclaim how excited I am about life.  One friend seems to get what I’m saying and comments on a few of the connections and how it’s an interesting take on the relationship.  I agree and am stoked that someone else shares my new view on life.  We pack our things into the car and proceed to get ready to head out.  My neighbors are outside, a young couple in their late twenties doing some yard work.  I strike up a conversation about the weather since it was nice out and proceed to fill them in on our entire trip planned for the day.  They seem curious about cliffjumping since they’ve never done it before so I tell them that it’s about the best natural rush you can possibly get.  I’m having the best day ever I think to myself.  
	We finish packing and head down to the local REI.  Me and a friend are going to buy some Vibram five fingers for the trip.  In our opinion, these are going to be the best shoes ever to go cliff jumping with, and I willing drop $90 on a brand new pair.  I buy a year-long membership to REI while I’m there because hell, why not.  We pick up parking passes for the place that we’re heading to and embark on the short trek out there.  On the way, I’m starting to feel how the music we’re listening to is affecting our immediate moods.  It’s also interesting to me to note when we drive through shady spots as opposed to light spots.   I’m convinced that something about the shade brings out more negative conversation than that of when we’re in the light.  I keep telling my passenger to make notes of the some of the things that we’re thinking up on the way out there.  “Wandering thought train of love” is what I feel we are while in my car and am stoked on it.  Rolling down the windows completely changes the dynamic of the ride and each billow is affecting my mood.  I’m amazed that I hadn’t noticed how light and sound affected me previously and make sure to tell my friend to jot down (364) because it represents the light spectrum from a computer’s standpoint.  
	We arrive at the exit and no joke, its number 41.  I take this immediately as a good omen because of the number 14 that the ladybug had told me the previous night.  I get utterly excited and know that I am meant to be here at this place with all of these specific people.  We make the 2-mile hike in to the waterfall and setup shop at its base.  There are tons of people that I know here who I wouldn’t normally expect to see and I start to feel as though I’m the reason that they’re here.  People from my high school, people from work, and people from my college all in the same spot enjoying what I feel to be the most beautiful day ever.  I start talking to one of my friends from college, saying how I’m never smoking or drinking or doing drugs ever again because I’m so high on life.  He questions me on it and I argue that there is no better high than being completely sober because it allows you to experience all of your senses to the max.  He shurgs, agrees, and walks off with beer in hand.  
	The day progresses and I meet an Indian fellow taking pictures of the waterfall.  I ask whether or not he’s from Gao as I would love to visit there someday.  I’ve heard about headphone parties they have there where there are 3 DJs spinning and you can select which one to listen to on your headphone frequency selector.  I take his contact info down in my phone because I really want to go to India.  Cliffjumping concludes and I depart from my group to head the complete opposite direction where my parents live.  I realize I haven’t packed anything for the 3 day weekend but I could care less.  All I have on is a shirt, shorts and my vibrams.  
	On the drive out, I stop at a local convenience store/ gas station to pick up some gas and grub.  I feel as though I’m meant to stop here.  I start talking to these teens who have the same hat as one of my friends that I was at the musical festival with.  I ask if they know her and it turns out that they do.  I’m not surprised by this because I’m at the point where I’m feeling all powerful and that everything is happening for a reason.  I text my friend saying that I met Lucas, one of her friends from the ski camp where these teens were staying.  I get a huge question mark in return.  I proceed to the checkout and the cashier looks at me, and says that he was at the same music festival.  He tells me that he just went and was able to get in completely free.  I am now convinced that something divine is happening to me even though I’m not a religious person at all.

1eylbj,9,2013-05-24,A general outline of the hiring process for prospective LEOs,[deleted],ProtectAndServe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1eylbj/a_general_outline_of_the_hiring_process_for/,"To preface: I am not an LEO, but am working towards it. A couple months ago I promised to make a thread about polygraphs since there seemed to be many new threads being created about that subject. Now that school is finally over and I have time, I can get around to making this. I've also decided to talk about everything I can think of about the hiring process. I'll try to make it as linear as possible starting from the time you would fill out the application, to the time you get hired.

**Application**

You will begin any just like any job search. You will fill out an application. Keep in mind that EVERYTHING you put down on this application will be looked at and will be the basis for your vetting later down the line. Be sure to fill this out to the best of your knowledge, **do not omit anything.** Most applications will ask something to the affect of the following:

* Personal Information:
Name, DOB, current and past addresses. Immediate family members, etc.

* Social Status:
Marriages (past and present), if you have children, do you live with your spouse, do you pay alimony/child support (if applicable)

* Education:
High School information, College information, and any other relevant education

* Driving History:
DL information, tickets, accidents, etc.

* Military Service:
Basically all of the information on your DD-214 including the narrative, character of discharge, RE code, etc.

* Criminal History:
List **ALL** arrests, fines, citations. Doesn't matter if they are expunged or hidden

* Employment History:
List every job, your duties, reason for leaving, and be prepared to explain any periods of unemployment

* Credit History:
List your financial institutions, any debt owed, etc. The agency will do a credit check

* References
List adults who the police agency may contact to obtain information about you. A background investigator will talk to your references, then ask who your references know of that may also know you, the BI will then contact those people, and so on.


After the HR department reviews your application and determines that you are not disqualified based on the information in the application, they will schedule the next step of the process, which is usually the written test or the physical fitness test. Each department varies.

* Physical Fitness Testing
This is really up to the state standards or the individual department. Most tests are not that hard. The state I am referencing wants a 13 minute mile and somewhere along the lines of 60 sit ups and 60 pushups. Standards are different for males and females and are different based on your age.

* Written test
The written test is an exam that usually measures your basic math, comprehension, English, and problem solving skills. The most common test that is administered is the POST test. This is a study guide by the US Capitol Police and can give you a good idea of what is on the test: http://www.uscapitolpolice.gov/post_study_guide_09.pdf


After you have passed the physical fitness and written tests, you will most likely move onto the oral panel interview. These interviews will be conducted by a panel of ~3 officers and they will interview you individually, or in a group. Each department asks different questions. Most will be hypothetical. A few that I have had asked are:

* ""What are your thoughts on race and crime?""

* ""Law enforcement is very stressful, and stress can take a heavy toll on an officer, what is something you would do to minimize the effects of stress?""

* ""You stop a vehicle, and the driver says he works in the city government for the same municipality that you are employed. The driver states that there will be problems for you if you choose to issue a citation for the infraction, how would you handle the situation?""

There are really no right answers for these questions, just answer honestly.


If you pass the oral panel interview, you will be put on a list with others either of everyone that has passed, or the top 25/50/75/etc applicants. The list is in order of who scored the highest in the phases so far. The next part of the process (and again, this will be different with every department. Some departments may vet you first) is the interview with the chief or sheriff. You could be waiting on this list for months, sometimes even as much as two years before you hear back. During the chief's interview they will usually ask some more hypothetical questions, and make a decision to hire you. Your hiring will be conditional on a favorable outcome of the background check and psych/medical evaluation.

* Background investigation
This is the fun part. The BI will call your references, and the references of your references, and call the police department of every place you have lived, talk to your neighbors and do everything he or she can to find a reason **NOT** to hire you. If you didn't disclose something in your application, they will find it. 

* Polygraph
What everyone worries about. The truth is you shouldn't worry about it. No one really takes them that seriously anymore, but it is used as a tool to get you to admit to something. A polygraph does not indicate if you are lying or not. A polygraph measures the physiological indications of stress (sweating, elevated pulse, etc). These are correlated with deception, but it doesn't mean you are being deceitful. There is no way to know if you are lying or not without you admitting it, and the person administering the polygraph will try to manipulate you into admitting something you didn't disclose on your application. The polygrapher will ask you some basic questions such as your name and DOB to establish a baseline of stress to detect any deviation from that. If you didn't omit anything on the application, you will be fine. You are expected to be stressed during this.

* Medical Evaluation
A doctor will evaluate you for any medical ailment you may have that could make it difficult or impossible for you to perform the duties required for a police officer

* Psychological Evaluation
A mental health professional will interview you and make sure you are rational enough to deal with the stress of the job. Schizophrenia, Bipolar, and just about all personality disorders are disqualifying, whether they are controlled by medication, or not.

After all of these steps (maybe in that order, or not) you will be hired and sent to the police academy. Police academies usually run anywhere from 3-6 months and will teach you *almost* everything you need to know to be an officer in your state. Check on your state's merit commission to find out more information about academies and standards. After you are out of the academy, you will take to the streets with a field training officer (FTO). This FTO will shadow you for a few months to a year and after that you will be on your own (or with a partner).

That's pretty much it. Some other random things I can think of are do everything you can now to make yourself stand out, volunteer, intern, do **RIDE ALONGS**, join an explorer post if you can. Also, stay away from Criminal Justice degrees if you can, they are really limited to law enforcement, and the truth is, you may not get hired. For every single open position there are probably at least 50 people fighting for that spot. Look at degrees like Psychology, Sociology, Computers, etc. Find something you can bring to the table at that department. Something that will make you an asset. The academy will teach you everything about the law enforcement side. 

If you have any specific questions, refer to the agencies you are looking at or look up the website for your state’s law enforcement merit commission. They will have more specific information that I can’t provide. This was just an outline for what most hiring processes look like

If I was wrong on something, or missed something, please let me know!

I imagine that if we already need to get underground for a situation like this, why not work out some situation where it works out great for the unfortunate home-owner already.  Two to three floors.  The top floor would be set-up like a ranch-style house (minimal storage or no storage up there), the bottom two floors or floor would have all the important stuff.  Make the top floor easy to redecorate in case of Mother Nature bullshit nightmares, like the one that happened the other day.  It's not my job to work any of that out anyway.  We get the guys with degrees to do that.  Back to my beer-drinking internship at my house.

1eyhzv,0,2013-05-24,"I feel like this is something that bothers me, but I don't think many people will see it as a problem. Or at least, not yet.",mykelmontes815,ainbow,https://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/1eyhzv/i_feel_like_this_is_something_that_bothers_me_but/,"I understand we're currently in an era in which a majority of society view gay rights as a necessary value, while at the same time, we are struggling with legalizing same-sex marriage everywhere since there are still people intolerant of homosexuality. So, I feel like there is an issue that needs to be acknowledged, but will most likely be ignored since we already have the main problem.

Still, I'd like to ask about the issue of today's teens that come out and try to define themselves with their orientation. Most teens want to be noticed, and will do so by finding something to be recognized by, and many will use sexual orientation. I think that this has resulted in some teens lying to themselves about their own orientation after seeing how interesting gay culture is. I've noticed it with a friend I knew in middle school who temporarily considered himself bisexual.

I'm not saying that teens that come out as gay/bisexual today are lying, but I believe that some are.

My sister has this friend who is openly gay. Before he came out, I believe he did have a crush on my sister. I'm not sure. But when he came out, my sister said that his attitudes and behavior changed. He would speak loudly and with feminine tone with many friends, but would speak completely calmly and naturally with my sister. He also made his straight friends uncomfortable by hitting on them, to the point where the straight friends had to tell him to stop.

I also know of another gay young man who is very trendy and fashionable (his Facebook profile said he was an intern at Vogue) who was in a group of friends I saw at Starbucks. Two of my friends talked with them, and when the group of friends left, the gay young man called to my friend and said ""See you when you turn 18"". I've also seen a picture on Facebook of a student with a substitute teacher, and the young man commented on it saying ""This sub looks very fuckable.""

I think that it is fairly annoying when straight people bring up their sexual desires when it is unwelcome and I believe it is equally annoying when people of another orientation do the same. It would be hard for one to speak out about it because that person would risk being viewed as homophobic. I truly believe that sexual orientation should not define a full person. I understand that this was a good thing to do when people needed to rebel in order to defend homosexuality, but these days, I think homosexuality should be blended in so that sexual orientation becomes only a normal human characteristic, along with ethnicity, height, weight, hair color, eye color, etc.

I feel like the type of teenagers that I complain about only make it harder for intolerant folks to learn to accept homosexuality in society, and also contradict the idea that sexual orientation is a natural gene that humans are born with. I think this is something that needs to be addressed so that orientation can be accepted by everybody without appearing abnormal.

Hopefully, I worded this well and didn't come across as offensive, and if I did come across as offensive, I apologize. But I am curious to know what others think."

1eyhr6,14,2013-05-24,Some advice for the newbies to the industry,AdvertisingWhore,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1eyhr6/some_advice_for_the_newbies_to_the_industry/,"So, I have been seeing more and more posts from young creatives, young suits, students, interns etc etc all with very similar themes: 

* It's long hard work for little pay - where is the dream job I thought I would have?

* People don't like my ideas or respect me!

* How long until I get a promotion?

* Are all agencies full of meanies?

So here is a bit of advice. Now it might sound cruel, but sometimes you need to hear a bit of a reality check. 

Advertising is fucking tough. You either have it or you don't. Time and tenure doesn't earn you respect, being fucking good at your job does. I've worked with 60 year olds who were ""Ok"" at their job, and subsequently relegated to working on the small little churn and burn work. And I've worked with 25 year old ECDs who won awards more often than most creative took a shit. 

The point it, Advertising isn't like any other industry. You don't earn your stripes through hard work and determination. You earn your stripes through being good. 

Now, that's not to say there isn't a place for people in this industry that a just good solid employees. In fact, the industry relies on them. If everyone was a high-flyer then none of the real work would get done. Everyone would just sit around thinking up Cannes Lion campaigns and rolling joints in their $100 bills.

What I'm saying is that if you watched Mad Men and thought ""I want to be DON!"" or ""I want to be Peggy"" well here's a reality check. These are the 5%ers. And people can tell pretty damn quickly whether you are in this category or not. 

As for respect, or handling criticism - I'll give you the same advice my first CD gave me. After pinching my arm he said ""Seems thick enough. You'll need it. Because mate, if you don't have a thick skin, there's the fucking door."" Seriously. If you're feelings get hurt because someone didn't like your idea / headline / layout / brief / strategy - perhaps you aren't cut out for this gig. 

I once had an ECD say to me, ""This TVC is the single worst ad I have ever had my name attached to."" How did I respond? Did I cry, did I get hurt feelings? Honestly, yeah - it stung a bit. But I pulled my shit together, nodded my head and said ""Yup - she was pretty bad."" And I moved the fuck on. 

Honestly, if you need to turn to a Reddit forum to ask advice, I would start seriously considering a career shift. 

The number of people who were in my year at Ad School and are still working in the industry is 3. 3 Out of 30. 

**TL;DR - ""If you don't have a thick skin, there's the fucking door.""**

I decided to move back to my parent's home, borrow money from them, and use it to get a CS degree (and hopefully a programming job). Unfortunately, my work history is utter shit: throughout high school and college, I only worked a couple of unimpressive jobs, and only a few months at each. I did not find a job after the B.A, and moved home just a few months later.

 While I would prefer to spend all of my waking hours outside of school programming, in the hopes of building a good portfolio and impressing internship recruiters (and because it's FUN!), I wonder if I'm just setting myself up for disaster by not working.

However, the pay was for a lowly 11 dollars an hour non negotiable and she offered me the job right away after the interview, which led me to believe that it was probably a high turnover job (benefits after 90 days, but I have to pay part of the health/vision/dental and no vacation 1st year).

There literally is only a 30 minute training session on the software when I come in the first day and that's it. My boss keeps on making remarks on why I don't get stuff, but he never fully explains what I'm supposed to do. I could tell he is also stressed because the entire department is so behind on everything and they are missing deadlines. So they are shoving stuff into me without explaining stuff and expect it to get done. They are so unorganized in their process. Lastly, you can tell the department is low on morale. None of the employees in my department seem to care about each other. They work, they go home. No small talk, nothing. Their pay is as low as mine, and one of my co-workers just quit literally the 2nd day I came in. Never showed up again. Didn't even call them.

I have to keep the job for the experience, but I'm already looking for ways out. When can I start applying for new jobs? Is it way too soon? Will employers look bad upon that?

1eyaui,6,2013-05-24,"Having a real hard time getting over a breakup, need to vent out a bit",TheBozzCL,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/1eyaui/having_a_real_hard_time_getting_over_a_breakup/,"I've been reading some of the other posts around here, and my problems seem really minor compared to what other people are going through. Still, I've been having it rough lately, so I need to spit it out.

Last year I started dating a friend's sister. Everything was great for the first three months, we were really into each other... until she told her parents I have Asperger's. She didn't tell me she was going to do it, nor she did ask for my permission. I was devastated because it was a really hard topic for me at the time, especially without my consent, and fell into a depression that only got diagnosed recently.

I was deathly afraid of how they would react because I've been discriminated against and bullied because of my syndrome in the past; I thought ""What if they don't approve of me now? What if my girlfriend changes her mind about me?"". One would think that it should change nothing... but things *did* change. She became progressively more distant and cold, and whenever I asked if anything was wrong she would say she just was tired. She stopped inviting me over to her house and having lunch with me, and whenever I complained we were spending too little time together she said she was too busy with her internship. That didn't stop her from spending time with me before, but I decided to trust her and do my best to cope with my insecurity.

Two months went by this way, with her becoming more and more distant but denying anything was wrong, and me feeling more insecure and unwanted. In the end, we were spending maybe an hour per week together. I blew up and told her I couldn't take it, that I felt she was not interested in our relationship anymore. She called me selfish and said I could not expect her to spend more time on me. We had an argument and decided to take a break to think things through. She didn't talk to me for a whole week, and whenever I tried to talk to her she would push me away. In the end, I had to ask her brothers what was wrong... they both said she didn't want to be with me anymore.

The next day she talked to me, and broke up with me using lame excuses and even lying to me to make me feel guilty. This devastated me. I mean, she never even voiced a complaint about me and now she's so desperate to get away from me as to not even give me a proper breakup? I was dumbfounded for a month, but then I became incredibly angry. I didn't do anything to her to deserve that treatment. I made the mistake of venting out on Facebook... of course she heard about it. She called me and told me she wanted to talk to clear things out. I said no, because I still was too hurt and needed more time to heal. So she proceeded to write me an email with everything she wanted to say. I didn't want to read it, but I forced myself to because I felt that at least I could learn something. I was wrong: it was all even lamer excuses and childish banter. I couldn't believe it, *this* was her way of clearing things up? In the end, I just gave her what her wanted: I told her I understood what happened better now, then I told her that I loved her for real, that not having her with me hurt too much so I needed her to stay away from me. We haven't talked or seen each other since then.

It's been about seven months since she broke up with me. During that time, I've been going to therapy to try and overcome my fear of being discriminated, as well as trying to understand what went wrong with our relationship. It took us a lot of effort because many of the things she said and did were so contradictory, but in the end we had to accept it was because I have Asperger's... literally *nothing* else happened that could have driven her away the way it did and make her leave without any explanation at all. It's very probable her parents stopped approving of me, and their approval was way too important for her. My therapist says I need to understand she's way too immature for her age (she's 24). I have a hard time understanding it, tho, it's just too alien to me. It hurts a lot to think about it, even now.

In the meantime, lots of other things have happened: I severed contact my ex's brothers (both were really good friends, even after their sister broke up with me) and I distanced myself from our group of friends because I didn't know how to deal with the situation and they were making too many questions; I realized I can't really use the rest of my friends to vent out or as support because they know my ex or her family too; my family is too far away to give me any real support, and those who are closer don't understand anything about my condition or my past traumas; my depression and self-questioning have caused me to realize I took a wrong turn in my choice of career studies, which I still don't know how to deal with since this is my last semester before graduating. To top it off, right now I feel like I'm going to stay alone forever, with my circle of friends shrinking and little to no free time to meet new people because of college. My therapist and psychiatrist have helped a lot, I have to admit... but there's times I still feel overwhelmed by all of this.

The only problem is that when we started getting attached, we knew she was going to have to leave for the summer for an internship two hours away. At the beginning of those three weeks I was sure I couldn't do the long distance thing so I didn't push for it. I was also under the impression that she didn't want to get into a relationship since she was moving soonish.

About 10 days ago she brought up the idea of us dating and it basically planted the thought in my head. Ever since that night, I've been considering the long distance thing after all but now she's the one that's against it. She's been in a long distance relationship before and she said it was great during the summer but for reasons I still don't understand, she said it got bad when they started school up again in the fall.

She leaves the day after tomorrow and we haven't made a decision on whether we'll try the long distance thing or not. I told her that I don't think we should do it if we're both not completely psyched about it because we'd be doomed from the start (am I right in thinking this?). But in reality, I REALLY want to continue dating her, even though there may be some doubts lingering on either side.

So, do I continue pushing for a long distance relationship or should I not even bother convincing her if there's any convincing needed?

TL;DR: Girl I really like is moving two hours away for the summer, can't decide whether or not I should be pushing for a long distance relationship, should I even bother convincing her it's a good idea if we're not both completely psyched to be doing it?"

I am writing to inquire about possible internships in the HVAC field at COMPANY; my résumé is enclosed for your consideration. COMPANY philosophy that engineers should never stop learning and be on the cutting edge of technology appeal to me as a learning mechanical engineer.

Currently I am pursuing a bachelors of Science degree in mechanical engineering from COLLEGE. During my senior year I took a HVAC design course. The class required heating and cooling load calculation to be performed and from these calculations the hydronic and duct system were developed and implemented. The HVAC project introduced me to certain aspects of engineering, such as the economical aspect, efficiency, and the feasibility of the design.

In the course of my three years at COLLEGE, I have demonstrated my motivation, energy, and passion for engineering. In addition, I have learned to work efficiently under tremendous stress and, with limited resources, to accomplish goals. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute these abilities to COMPANY. I am available for an interview at your convenience. If you would like to call me rather than email me back, you can reach me at PHONE NUMBER. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Although that was a long time, it was refreshing to see my code work. I want to do this more, and get paid to do it

I see automation jobs paying a minimum of 50k, im in the 40k bracket, and it definitely wont get much higher staying at my current job. I don't really ever see selenium in job requirements, but even if they did, how much selenium would they expect me to know?

can someone give insight about what kind of test cases you do in your automation job, how advanced, how easy it is? I can provide some of my scripts, they are extremely noobie but work. My companies web app is pretty complex so I was happy to see I can automate even some parts of it. I would love to use python and webdriver to do more testing and get paid for it. Manual testing is fine, but there is too little work and too much downtime at my job. In my manual testing I dont do anything complex, and it didn't seem complex to automate it, so am I ready for an automation job? or am I being naive, i have no clue what kind of level of skill automation requires, i guess thats my biggest question"

Since day three of my freshmen year, I've been dating my girlfriend. We actually got together out of a hook-up; I was being an adventureous college male and stumbled into a 4 year relationship.

Since the beginning, we've had a lot of problems: she's pretty clingy, she's jealous time I don't spend with her, the list goes on. Half way through our freshmen year, she had a mental breakdown due to depression. I spent my entire second semester taking care of here, as she had made no friends except me. During this time, due to forced counseling I made her receive, she was diagnosed as bi-polar.

Near the end of that year, she had to take a medical leave from school to avoid failing her semester. Against my better judgement, I helped her lobby my mother to allow her to move in with me at my family's apartment during the summer. She did, and after I finished school, we spent the first part of the summer together. As that summer went on, I began to doubt us, and grow resentful of here; I worked all day and would want to see friends at night, but she just wanted to sit in her room and watch television from dawn to dusk. 

At about July of that summer, I asked her to go home a few times abortively, but chickened out and asked her to stay after I saw her reaction. It was about this time she began to say suicidal things over the possibility of me leaving her. Eventually, my mother had enough and bascially forced her to go home; though I acted hurt in front of her, I was secretly incredibly grateful to my mom. I moved her back to her home in another state and spent the rest of the summer apart, though still together long distance.

Start of Sophmore year. Both of us return to school, different dorms and all. The time we spent together only increased, and not by my choice, but I continued to go along stupidly. She remained very clingy, and she also completed neglected her schoolwork, while hiding the failure from her parents. Mid-way through this year, she began pushing the marriage question, and being weak, I gave in and start looking at engagement rings with her just to make my life easier.

After failing her whole year almost, summer came again. This time, I tried putting my foot down and told her I was through with it. We were apart for a few days, but after about a week, she turned up back in my city having found a job and a family friend to live with for the summer. I tried ignoring her, but..I gave in again and starting seeing her again. It's probably good to note at this point that my family hated her, and vice versa. So...ashamedly, I started lying to both parties over dating her.

Junior year. Much as the same as the last two years: she failing all her classes to remain with me, while I continued on blindly because I was too weak to break it off. I felt drained and beaten every day, and I continue to today, even long distance. At the end of this year, I got an extremely important internship that required me to travel across the country. Lying to her about the job requiring me to live where they told me, I left for a blissful free summer away from her.

Finally, to my final senior year, this year. Due to her family being unable to continue to pay for her to attend school and fail every class, she has lived at home three hours away the entire year. The freedom has been wonderful, especially since I finally had time to be a college kid with my friends and roommates. But almost weekly trips up to see her, as well as her taste in dining out and shopping, have drained me financially, put me in debt and left me destroyed.

And now..I'm a week away from graduation and I can't do it anymore. I've lied to her so much; part of me blames her, but part of me feels like I'm culpable for leading her on for so many ears. I really don't want or am able to have her see me graduate, and I just can't continue. I have a job lined up across the country, and I don't want to bring her or be with here anymore. 

But whenever I try to break it off face to face, whether at a neutral place like a mall in between us, or at either of our homes, I find myself clawing in to escape the pain, the heartbreak, the crying and her hysteria. She knows exactly what to do to sink me back in, the exact words and all. I know she's the type that will continue even if I break it off; I'm paranoid she will show up at my graduation with my family and start trouble.

 I'm a defeated and weak man. I don't know how I can do it; over the phone, a text message, Skype, and then just stop talking to her? She know's where I live, she has a million excuses to rope me in. I have stuff of hers, she has stuff of mine. She has five million guilt trips to keep me and I feel absolutely powerless to be free. I can't take this anymore Reddit! I know I've contributed by being a lying asshole, but I can't figure out how to make this right for everyone involved.

1exzsc,1,2013-05-23,Question about transferring money from credit to checking,MA34,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1exzsc/question_about_transferring_money_from_credit_to/,"I am in a situation where I:

* Am low on cash until the end of the month (~$40)
* Have a stable source of income (paycheck at the end of the month)
* Have Checking, Savings, and Credit Accounts
* Have a debit card but no credit card at the moment

My question is this: will transferring cash from my credit card to my debit card be a horrible idea with bad financial consequences?

I don't have very much experience/knowledge in financial matters but it is my understanding that doing this will lower my credit score and will also incur fees. I was not able to find the cost of these fees listed on my bank's website. I need to transfer money to my debit card because I disposed of my credit card a while ago because it was very worn out from being in my pocket without a wallet all of the time and I haven't bothered to replace it yet.

I have always been responsible with my money and have never paid any interest on my credit card. I am currently on break from college and have a relatively well paying internship this summer (~$20 an hour), so I will be able to pay off whatever I transfer from my credit account with no interest without a problem.

I can provide more details on my situation if it is necessary... Basically the reason I am in this situation is I have been living the life of a poor college student the last few years. Thanks for any help!

EDIT: My credit card is through my bank - I can transfer things online very easily. I just need to replace the physical card."

I go to a state university and plan to graduate with above a 3.5 GPA (hopefully more like 3.9, but there are some hard classes my senior year that I'm nervous about), and I'll have a couple of big name ~~scholarships~~ **internships** in gas and oil under my belt (I live outside of Houston). I know this would appear great on my resume to a potential employer however, I have no idea how a university would view it, or if I'm even competitive in that arena. 

Another thing is I would really like to attend a good school for my field such as Cal Tech, MIT, etc. Someone told me that since Computer Science PhD student's are relatively rare I might have a chance of getting in. How much truth is there to this, if any?

1exudo,1,2013-05-23,Undergrad with questions about admissions/undergrad school,dayne-sword,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1exudo/undergrad_with_questions_about/,"
Hi, I'm a college freshman finishing up my year at a large state flagship. I wanted to know how important an undergrad institution is in grad school admissions. I'm at my current school primarily due to finances; when I applied, my family wasn't doing too hot. Academically, I'm doing great (4.0), double majoring in Math/CS with a minor in Econ. 

- I came in with AP credit, got to some mid-upper level courses, and am involved in research with a professor as well (CS prof). I've done lab internships since HS, and I'm very sure I'd like to go to gradschool and become a researcher. 

- Overall, I don't feel satisfied with my school beyond doing 'well' there. I'm happy with my grades, work, etc. but the overall educational expereince isn't what I wanted. I'm not too fond of the atmosphere or size either. Due to this, I've thought of transferring to an overall better school (my school has a strong CS dept, ok math dept, and very weak econ dept). The schools I want to transfer to will have equal CS department strength, and better math/econ departments.

- If I transfer, which would be as a junior, and leave my current instituion- I'd have to ultimately find a new prof to work with. Does having breaks/working with different people matter? I have an REU for this summer, and I'll probably try one for the next. Is research experience in general more important than whatever specific projects you have worked on (as long as they're fairly relevant).

- I'm split on whether I want to go to grad school for Econ or CS. I enjoy both subjects. At my current school, there's research going in CS that I like, but the Econ department isn't doing work in the areas I'm interested in. If I transfer, I could work in areas of Econ I enjoy, and even I end up not enjoying Econ work, I could still continue work in CS areas I'm interested in (which is at all the schools I'm interested in transferring too). 

- Ultimately, down the road I may regret not transferring. I have this feeling at the back of my head that I could've gone to a better undergrad. I don't know if this will be bad for grad admissions since I'd sort of have to start over at a new school, though by then I'd have almost 4 years of lab/intern research experience in total. In either case, transfer or not, I'll still focus on gaining skills. 

-Thanks!"

I've just turned 20 and am graduating after 3 years at a UC, and am pleased as punch about that.  But I cannot move back to my parents' house in Southern California.  It's a toxic environment, and I'd like to get into the publishing industry - hence, Bay Area.

Right now I've got about $200 in my account and a credit card (I pay for entirely).  The plan right now is to move in with my partner, into the house he rents with friends.  The lease runs out in August, so we need to find a place to live roughly by the end of July.  My portion (including utilities) is a little shy of $400 / month.  Until I had a fight with my father, I expected my cell bill to be $50 a month (verizon, unlimited text and data).  My partner and I try to only buy what we need, usually food, and be cheap and frugal with that.  I receive free reproductive and mental healthcare from the state.  Partner is at roughly the same place I am, but with parental support so he never has to be late on rent.

I've been applying everywhere I can, but still have not found a job.  I do have an internship, with the goal of making myself more marketable to publishing companies.  It looks like my partner might not have more than a few odd jobs this summer.  I do not have a car (do have a bike and bus pass), but he does, so my potential places of employment are limited by transportation.

I have not bought anything except food and some new sandals, because mine broke, in the last year.  I try to cut out everything, and shop thrift stores if I need more clothes.  Right now we're contemplating moving to Oregon instead of staying in the Bay Area because of taxes, but are still planning on staying near the money in hopes of finding jobs.

I'm looking for some advice on what I can do to save more, advice on finding a phone plan (I'd keep my phone, and can deal with not having the best of the best, and am thinking I'll stay with verizon), and just in-general advice for someone who's graduating and does not know what to do because their bank account keeps getting smaller and smaller despite all attempts at frugality."

I'm doing a summer internship in a city that I don't know many people in (my parents moved here while I was at school so this is my first time even being here). As I'm spending the next four months here, I definitely want to try to make the most of it and make some connections and meet people. Where I work, there are other interns my age, however we don't work in the same departments so its really only chance that we ever run into each other.
Yesterday, though, we all decided to get a together, as the new interns and go out for lunch. That worked out rather well, and I got along with two of the guys really well, and I found out that they, too, don't really know anyone around town. 

**And now the question part...**
I didn't feel like we had known each other all well enough to ask for phone number swapping or anything, though I would really like to get to know theses guys better to hopefully try to build some sort of social life here this summer. I just don't know what the next step is if I want to try to organize something else. We all have work emails, however I personally feel like sending a ""hang out"" offering would seem a bit odd in the workplace. (It should be noted that we organized lunch just one of the times we ran into each other one day). I *do* know enough about them to be able to find them through Facebook, but I don't really know what that would look like if I added them right now. Frankly, I'm not very worried about actually talking to them or being social, but most of my worries come from initiating any plans or actions to get to that point. 

So, any good tips and such for trying to get this going more?  


**TL;DR** - Working in a new town for the summer, want to get to know some of the fellow interns better. Not sure how to get other plans organized as we don't see each other on a regular basis. And, is it weird to add people on Facebook after only really getting to know them over lunch?"

Second year started, still great, still awesome, when suddenly my best friend ever quit his studies without letting anyone know, including me. By this time, i was running behind on my studies, and got into more and more classes with people i didn't know and who had formed friend groups of their own. I was waiting for my best friend to come back, thinking he was just sick and needed some rest. half a year passed, and i decided to contact him anyway. Which is when i discovered he quit.

So then the next year started. I was alone by now, all my friends had gained on me and i ran behind even more. I had no idea how to get accepted into other friend groups, and got more and more lonely. My social life stopped existing.

3 years later, i decided to quit the studies. I was feeling very lonely, and my internship at a high school wasn't going as planned. My coach saw that i didn't feel at home and asked me why i hadn't quit earlier. It was all because i told myself this was what i wanted to do all my life.

Since my best friend left, my social development stopped. I'm 24 now, started a new study to become a lab assistant, and i've felt like i've made some friends, but i feel like it's not really friendship. It feels empty, and fake. It feels like I'm not giving everything to be friends, and I think i'm doing this because i'm afraid to lose another friend. I never ask anyone to go out, because i want others to ask me, which hasn't happened so far. I'm afraid of people. I'm afraid of making friends because they'll leave me anyway(which is probably not true at all, i know. But i need proof to believe that again...)

the only people i consider real friends are people i've met online, and chat with online on a regular basis. We meet up about 2 or 3 times a year, which makes me feel loved and cherished.

At school I feel like i'm being watched all the time. When i try to be funny, it fails. When i try to make friends with the people who have more friends, it fails. They look at me like i'm some sort of nerd who's trying to be popular. I'm just a normal person, but i don't know how to make friends without losing them. I do have some people i sit with, play games with and talk with at break time, but it just doesn't feel like

i still live with my parents. I should have moved out a long time ago, but that wasn't possible because of money and failing studies. I imagine my life will be a lot better when it comes to a social life when i move out (which is going to be soon), because then i'll be living nearer people my age.

Anyway, i feel lonely and needed to vent some of this. I know what i need to do, but i just don't have the courage to do it...

1f1orv,27,2013-05-25,Took my technician class exam....,kaesekopf,amateurradio,https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/1f1orv/took_my_technician_class_exam/,"And passed!  I attempted the general (which I hadn't really studied for, but my chemical engineer friend said there was a decent chance I could pass - I am working on completing my electrical engineering degree), but neglected to pass that.  SO, it's something to strive for now!

But, I'll be on a semi-limited budget until March 2014 (when my degree is completed).  

My biggest reasons for joining the ranks of hams is it's intrigued me for a while, I'm (going to be) an EE, tinkering/building is a fun hobby, and it sounds neato burrito.  Plus, I've worked with a number of hams before (at a previous internship I've had) and they recommended it.  

I'm going to be picking up a Yaesu FT-60R later Memorial Day week.  Gotta pick up my paycheck from work on Tuesday, so I'll order it at lunch.  :D  

I live in a small town (which has a repeater, still need to check it out a bit more) and there's a club that operates out of the nearest bigger city.  Plus, there is Louisville, but I haven't looked to see if they're more active.  But, if things go right, I'll be moving to New Albany, which is a bit closer.  ramble.

Anyways, my field of specialty is analog engineering, so I hope to eventually build my own shack, at least as far as I can.  I consider electromagnetics the devil, but I'll soon have to learn it, so ....  haha.  

But, the goal right now is to get the FT-60R, get some time under my belt on the airwaves (as much as I can), and start looking at what I can design/build myself, and how I can make things pretty sweet.  

I really like this community, by the way.  They definitely helped motivate me AND study/get a good feel for the ""culture.""

I might also get involved with Skywarn and ARES.  The region I'm living in now has a bad history of rough weather, so being able to help out (probably).  Need to figure out how to get a mobile rig going on my leased Corolla...  haha.

1f1hpj,17,2013-05-25,Guy I met is getting feelings for me faster than I am for him,throwawayXF,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1f1hpj/guy_i_met_is_getting_feelings_for_me_faster_than/,"Long post is long.

**tl;dr**

**A guy is developing feelings for me faster than I am developing feelings for him. This is the result of a combination of my life experiences and that we have only been able to see each other once. At the end of the post, I've got some options I'm considering.**

I'm in my early 20's and will finish my undergraduate degree in 1-2 years. After that I'm off to grad school - probably in a different state. I'm a double major (in the natural sciences) and regularly take 20+ hours per semester because I think it's fun. I'm the guy that finishes the homework in a couple hours that took everyone else days, then makes himself available to help out anyone who asks. I also make time to party every once in a while.

I *like* caring about people, and it is nice to be part of a support group like that. What usually happens is that people start to consider me a friend quite a bit before I start considering them to be a friend.

When I was growing up I was bullied for being different and the kids I made friends with betrayed me. It got so bad that I had to switch elementary schools. It wasn't until middle school that I made friends I actually kept for a long time. By the time I made it to high school I'd learned how to read people and figure out whether I could trust them, but it still takes a long time for me to become emotionally attached. If I'm not around people I consider friends, the emotions I show are very measured and calculated. I don't make myself emotionally vulnerable.

I have around 7 friends I consider myself close to - the ones I can talk to. I have talked to them about this, but I was wondering if any of y'all had some advice.

I am sexually active. A lot of guys consider me good looking, but I'm not the kind of guy who enjoys my own image. I'm skinny with a little muscle. When I hook up with guys, it's usually bears/cubs in their 30's and 40's. I'm ... well ... into that.

A little over a month ago, I decided to start looking for a long term relationship. Online, I found a very nice guy just a couple years older than me and my type. He is a very good person, and I know he is someone I could fall in love with. The process of me getting to that point is not easy, and could take years. It takes about a year for me to consider someone a close friend (~2-4 months for me to think of them as a friend). He makes me happy - I find myself smiling when talking to him on the phone or texting. We text a lot. Whoever gets up first will usually message the other with a good morning, and whoever goes to bed first will say good night and text *hugs*. Whenever he's having a problem at work or in his life, I try to be there for him as best I can.

He lives about 90 minutes from where I go to school during the year, and 3 hours from where I have a summer internship. Travel isn't really an issue for me since the hours at my internship are very flexible - I get Saturdays and Sundays off, and I can choose one work day per week to get off with very little notice. He lives with his mother currently - but soon won't, and has a stable job. His mother is not okay with his sexuality, and will not let me come over. So he has only been able to make the trip to see me once. We play online games together, and usually Skype so we can talk.

I have some feelings for him (at no point have I tried to keep myself emotionally distant with him as I normally do others), and it has become obvious that he already has more feelings for me than I have for him. He called me a few days ago drunk and wanted to talk to me. He said no one - not even his former boyfriends - had been as nice to him as I had. Just before hanging up, he said he loved me. He woke up the next morning and said he didn't remember what he'd said.

So now I know that he loves me, but I don't love him yet. I'm not sure what I should do.

There are several options I'm considering, but I'm not sure which one (or combination) is best (or if there are others I haven't considered):

1. **Seek professional help.** I'm not sure how normal it is to keep myself emotionally distant from most people, or if it is healthy to interact in this manner. I consider myself emotionally stable, and have healthy outlets for anger (both in friends, games, and writing).

2. **Tell him that he said he loves me.** I don't want him to think I'm not interested - just that it takes me a while to really warm up to people. Should I be up front about what he said and that I do not feel that way yet?

3. **Seriously date other people.** I've never seriously dated anyone before, and I've still only gone on one date with this guy. We are not exclusively dating - I've already confirmed this with him. It is possible someone else might be a better fit for me. Also, while I may be the right guy for many other guys, there might only be a few guys that are right for me in ways not immediately obvious.

4. **Tell him to back off / slow down.** It is possible he will try to move the relationship faster than I'm comfortable with, so I may need to make it clear that I need to move more slowly than other people."

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is AAAA and I am a 5th year medical student at the Faculty of  Medicine of AAAA. I would like to apply for a clinical elective between 00-00-0000 and 00-00-0000 (00 weeks) at the AAAA School of Medicine, preferably in Surgery.

I am about to finish what has been a unique experience at academic and personal levels. During the last five years, I have learnt the principles of the science and art of the medical profession, have observed a spectrum as vast as varied of patients, and have met admirable professors and colleagues. Thanks to all the people I have encountered, my interest in Medicine has never stopped growing and it has never been as great as it is now.

My 6th year of studies will consist entirely in a clinical internship and I would like to do part of it outside AAAA. In 2007, I had the luck of participating in a scientific internship at the AAAA, a memorable experience that allowed me to visit a foreign city and to meet a different culture. What I intend now, more than to revive a similar experience, is to broaden my perspective on Medicine. I have searched for an institution of reference in Europe in which I could also have for tutors professionals experienced in the teaching of clinical medicine. I believe the AAAA School of Medicine is exactly what I am looking for, and that’s why I am writing to you to express my interest in doing an elective in Surgery there.

General surgery both fascinates and challenges me. I am attracted by the breadth and depth of the knowledge and practical skills involved, as well as by the privilege and responsability that a surgery means for the surgeon. This notion of responsability made me conscious of the challenge a surgical field might represent for me, since I have AAAA and, therefore, poor stereoscopic vision and eye-hand coordination. I never thought of it has an irremediable handicap and have always tried to improve my skills through training, by myself and at workshops of experimental surgery in my faculty. Most of all, I became more aware of my limits.

Besides being very keen on doing an elective at AAAA, I also believe I am prepared. In my current phase of academic formation, I already possess a solid theoretical and practical foundation that allows me to practice clinical medicine semi-autonomously, and have also developed strong self-learning abilities. The previous internship I did in AAAA also served to teach me how to live by myself abroad, an experience I hope to repeat this next AAAA.

Sincerly,
koryo"
1f1de4,6,2013-05-25,I need to gush about her,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1f1de4/i_need_to_gush_about_her/,"This girl is beautiful, funny, and smart as hell. She's self-motivated, down to earth, and has these incredible eyes. She's exactly the kind of girl I've been wanting to meet in college.

She's an amazing kisser and, when she opens up, becomes a resilient, yet hopeful and sensitive person.

At moments of intimacy when we look into each other's eyes, I feel like crying because of how incredibly close I feel to her. I don't feel close to other people very often at all.

REALITY CHECK: 
I've probably already put too much pressure on this girl and this relationship in my mind. It's still very new. She might not see things the same way, and I'm way too insecure and cautious to make assumptions about her behavior. I'm leaving for an internship out-of-state within the week. When I come back in a few months, who knows where things will stand. 

I'll just have to use some patience, take things one at a time, and see if this goes anywhere. Fingers crossed. 

Right now, though, I'm just kind of dazed. "

[How'd you land the gig? What advice would you give to someone who wants to someday work to the point where he can make a living writing ha-ha's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eza9p/iama_two_comedy_writers_from_vh1s_best_week_ever/ca584sf?context=5)|I moved to NYC about five years ago to go to film school and get really into student loan debt. I started taking UCB classes and meeting people and basically begging to intern at places. I interned at HuffPo, Late Night W/ Jimmy Fallon, and The Onion. The Onion hired me, which was nice of them. Then they moved the company to chicago and I was out of a job so I made [a web series](http://www.youtube.com/user/untitledwebseries). That web series got me agents and a manager. Through them I submitted packets to a bunch of different shows and this one finally stuck. My advice: make the things. I worked on the tv periphery for a long time and no one thought of me as a creative until I made a thing. 
[Thanks! Appreciate the answers; gives me a little bit of hope.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eza9p/iama_two_comedy_writers_from_vh1s_best_week_ever/ca58l6y?context=5)|You should have hope! it's not impossible. 
[Can you talk more about getting agents and a manager? Where do you even begin, once you have work to show for yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eza9p/iama_two_comedy_writers_from_vh1s_best_week_ever/ca59we5?context=5)|Definitely. This is just how I did it but there's a lot of ways.
 |I made two short films which kind of got the UCB scene here in NY to think of me as a director. I started getting emails to direct web series' for people and I did a lot of that. I did an episode of ""Broad City"" and got hooked up with those girls (who are amazing people) and they recommended I meet with their manager. I did, and her and I hit it off really well. I had scripts and stuff ready to go in the event I was ever going to be contacted so I had a quick turnaround in terms of my writing samples. After my web series came out, my manager was contacted by agents who wanted to meet me. I went to LA to meet with people and see who was a good fit agent-wise. I'm really happy with my reps. The thing is, it sometimes seems really futile and hard to get noticed by these guys, but if you're generating a lot of content people seem to connect with and like, it will get seen. I can't really emphasize that enough. These agencies have whole departments dedicated to watching YouTube videos and stuff. They sign dogs for christsake! Just keep plugging along, say yes to every opportunity, make stuff you're proud of, and promote the shit out of it. It will get seen. Can't emphasize that enough. I was just a guy who made a web series that someone at ICM saw.
 |Another important thing to remember is to have stuff. Like, if you wanna be a writer, have your specs written. Have a feature written that's in a really good place. If you get a meeting with an agency or studio because you made a killer web video they're going to want to know you can do other stuff and are prepared. You gotta have stuff to give them.

[I have a hard time disclosing to people that I want to pursue comedic writing in a professional sense. People tend to scoff or think I'm delusional. This also may stem from the fact that I really disallow people to see that I am serious about it - it's sort of an insecure sore spot for me. I know that's something you eventually grow out of. I was wondering if you guys experienced similar feelings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1eza9p/iama_two_comedy_writers_from_vh1s_best_week_ever/ca5c1ce?context=5)|I mean- It's not like you're telling people you want to blow dogs for a living, you know? If people don't support you, you know, fuck 'em. There's no room for that. You should be surrounding yourself with people who believe in you and think you're capable of anything. Whether it's comedy writing or whatever. I think if you surround yourself with supportive, like minded people you'll feel less insecure about saying ""I want to be a comedy writer."" It's not ridiculous you want to do this. There's a lot of rejection but if you really want it and you're willing to do anything to make it happen you'll figure it out.

I didn't really make connections in school. Most of my connections came from UCB, but I wouldn't have been here without college. I would say it is not a bad idea to go to film school if you can end up in LA or NY because of it.

I was working as an intern (400eur per month) at a GmbH in Berlin. Due to my own terrible bank managing I did not realize that my boss had not been paying me. When I confronted him about it, he brushed it off and basically ignored me. I refused to come into work until it was settled, that was in March.

I have sent him a Mahnung, which was ignored, various e-mails and SMSes which have gone answered, but he just basically ignores me. A very friendly Redditor, who is a lawyer, offered me some advice, but it has fallen short of being useful, unfortunately.

I am leaving Germany next Saturday for the Netherlands, but I'm not giving up on this. He owes me 1600eur and I'm entitled to it, and I'm fucking getting it.

Now, I just don't know where my options are. I suppose I will get a Mahnbescheid by going through the Mahnverfahren. I really want to avoid that though, but my boss has refused to be amicable.

In the US normally I would turn to the newspapers and basically get my story out about this guy being a crook who uses interns for slave labor, refuses to pay them, and makes their lives hell. However, I don't know if that would be considered slander here. If I threaten him to go to the newspaper he might finally give in, as he's a pretty prominent name in the video game industry in Berlin and has given several speeches/keynotes at major industry events in Germany.

So, I appeal to anyone who is versed in law, a law student, or a lawyer, **PLEASE** help me. I don't have much money, but I can pay you what I can. I'm absolutely entitled to the money, have a legitimate job contract filed with the Agentur fuer Arbeit, and have proof I was never paid.

1f0rt4,11,2013-05-25,Hoping to move to Germany in Summer 2013 from the US - Could use some advice.,edafade,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1f0rt4/hoping_to_move_to_germany_in_summer_2013_from_the/,"Hi folks,

I'm going to lay down everything for you in hopes I might get some advice.

My girlfriend was born, and lives, in Germany. Having to fly to see her, or having her fly to see me, is pretty stressing. We hate having to say goodbye and I just can't do it anymore (It doesn't hurt that I've also fallen in love with the country). So, I decided to pull the trigger and attempt to move to her in July.

I don't speak much German yet, although I've been practicing everyday and hope to have a grasp of the language before July (Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, conversing with my GF, watching Köln 50667 [God help me], and watching movies in German). I also speak fluent English, and I am proficient in Spanish and Farsi.

I've already obtained my Bachelors in Psychology, taken the GRE (which I heard is ok to replace the Abitur?), and have nearly 2 years of clinical/research/teaching experience in a psychiatric setting. I have also worked in banking for almost 7 years. 

I also have enough money to start this whole process. I've saved for years in a rainy day account and I think I found the reason for it. So having money to fly out there, or to put money down on a place, isn't an issue.

Well, that sums on my qualifications, so now to the meat of the issue:

---

* Ideally, I want to live outside of Köln but work there or the surrounding areas (30-45 minute bus/train ride isn't an issue). Her parents already said it was cool to stay with them for a few months until I get my place sorted so I'm not worried about where I'm going to sleep until I find a place. However, since I want to work in Köln, where would be the best places to rent? Cheapest? Warm vs. Cold? I'm fine renting a room and living with other people, but I want to have my own place.

* I got my CV and my Resume up to date but I'm curious if resumes/CVs differ in Deutschland from the US. Do they? Would any of you be able to share an example of one for me?

* On that same note, I need to obtain a work visa. In order to do so, I need to secure a job before I fly out there. I know not speaking German works against me when it comes to finding a job, but I've heard countless stories of people speaking little or no German finding work. What is the best way for me to look for jobs? I've surfed the internet for a few hours and I am finding it difficult. I know in Germany you're required to do a 3 year internship in order to do a certain job and I'm wondering if my experience will help me? I'm not going to be picky (I'd even work in a warehouse, grocery store, or library), I just want a job that will cover expenses and get my foot in the door. Maybe you know of a job someone like me qualifies for? I can start straightaway, and work full-time, part-time, whatever. Any advice here is *very* appreciated.

* Any other information I haven't considered, or advice you might offer, would be accepted graciously."

I'm a business student who has just received an offer to intern for a prominent record label in Nashville for the next six months (I won't have to physically be in Nashville once classes start up again). The only catch is that they require proof from the university that I will receive credit for the program. How do I go about doing this? Do I just enroll into BUS299: BUS Internship? When researching this option, it sounds like I will receive 0 hours and I'm not sure if this qualifies as proof of receiving credit. I'd hate to see this opportunity fall through if BUS299 doesn't qualify. Anyone have any experience dealing with this sort of thing? 

I'm planning on getting in touch with someone down at UIUC, but would like some input over the weekend

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a full year. We go to the same college on the East Coast, but we are working in different countries over the summer so we are ""long-distance"" for 4 months. This has been hard, but we've been doing okay so far.


Here's where it gets a little hinky. **Once we get back from summer, we will be spending our last semester together.** This is because my boyfriend, Nate, is graduating and moving back to his home city (City 1) in Asia, and if his job this summer goes well, will be working full-time in City 2 (also in Asia). So City 1 and City 2 are going to be his main homes after school, and he doesn't plan on ever coming back to the United States again (due to a mixture of reasons, cultural and career-related).  After he graduates, I still have one semester left to finish college.


*Note: sorry for the vagueness of the locations; I am super paranoid and feel that the combination of cities and the situation is unique and there's a 1-in-1000 chance my boyfriend will chance upon this thread (he's a redditor).*


We have, at this point, realized that due to 1) my being primarily based in the States, all of my job opportunities will likely be in the States in the future, as well as my friends and my life, really and 2) his life is back in Asia, where he has friends and family, in addition to him not liking the culture in the States, that we should not pursue our relationship together after he graduates. **We will break up once he leaves the States.**


This decision has nothing to do with how much we love each other, or how compatible we are. It is purely because realistically, our paths are never going to cross after he leaves. It will be too hard, and even unfair, for one of us to uproot ourselves and sacrifice our familiar lives, job opportunities, and a lot of other things to move across the world to be with the other. I think it is a mature understanding, and we intend to make the best of the time we have left together. 


Unfortunately, it has also been breaking my heart since we've reached the decision, and as a result, I've been foolishly looking for ways to make this work. I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I'm supposed to give up on the one guy I've come to love because of something out of our control. We share the same heritage (both Asian, but he grew up in Asia whereas I grew up in the States), same sense of humor, sense of financial responsibilities, and most political and philosophical issues. Damn me that I've always been the type who can never just let it go. 






**Here's the catch:**


I am interning for a very large and well-known company based in NYC (where I will be this summer) that has headquarters all around the world, including one in City 2. What coincidence, then, that City 2 has been my dream work city ever since junior year of high school when I was lucky enough to vacation there. I fell in love with the city, the people, and the culture almost immediately (this goes way back before our relationship, and has nothing to do with Nate). 


I know it's a long shot. But I somehow convinced myself that at the end of my internship, if I can score a full-time job with this company (reasonable) and somehow magically be able to transfer to the City 2 location in a different department (not as realistic)...I can't help but wonder if we would be able to reconsider our ""planned breakup"" (super duper really not realistic, like seriously in trouble here). 


Reddit, I've been a long-time lurker and admirer of the sound advice that you've given to people here. Can you help me figure this out? Please knock some sense into me, no kid gloves needed, honest opinions appreciated. Heck, at this point, the fact that you've read this far is appreciated. :)


**TL;DR** I've been beating myself up for allowing myself to hope for a chance to simultaneously land a job in my dream city and continue my relationship with my boyfriend. I can't tell if I'm grasping at straws and need to wake the fuck up or if this is actually a glimmer of hope that I can work towards this summer. 

**edit**: I added some bolding/formatting because I pressed ""submit"" and the wall of text even scared me! So sorry for writing a novel. Let me know if the bolding helps or annoys you. "

So I've been recently hired on an internship this summer to create an independent game, and thought of an amazing story line, ran it by people to test for plot holes, etc etc, and that's all good. Then decided to name it. 

My story line set in the early 22nd century on Earth, where most of the technology is supported by solar power and solid light technology. Unfortunately the Sun is disintegrating without known reason, which flips everything into chaos - war breaking out between factions to grab what limited resources still exist. The game setting is in Europe and northern Africa.

I started coming up with names for my game (examples: ""~~Dying Light~~,"" ""~~Dying Sun~~,"" ""A Dying Sun,"" ""Death of the Sun""). Checking these names, came across ""The Dying Sun,"" [a sci-fi novel written in 1989](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dying_Sun) (which takes place in 21 century and follows an American duo fleeing Mexico - all while the sun is slowly diminishing). I had no knowledge of this book at all until yesterday, and suddenly feeling skittish. Can I still choose one of my titles, despite it being very closely related to this book? Or would that just scream lawsuit?

I've been reading previous ""how to name my game"" posts, but nothing answers this. Any help/feedback is welcome. Thanks!

P.S. Reason why I crossed out the first two names is became they are current games, [a popular zombie game in development](http://kotaku.com/surprise-dying-light-is-a-new-free-running-first-perso-509480939) and another [indie dev team.](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=32302.0)."

Later in the night the doorman approached me again, asking how I got down there, acting (rightfully so) very suspicious of me, and out of fear and embarrassment  I left very shortly after that. 

I've never stolen anything in my life before this. I have no idea why I did what I did. I dont even like the type of liquor I stole (I threw it away this morning without even opening it). The fact that I was at a work related event makes it so much worse. I have this immense fear that they caught me on camera and they put the cost of the bottle on the companies tab, ultimately allowing me to lose my internship. Or that they caught me and told my boss, and on Monday when I go in I will face an awkward sit down and, once again, termination. Me being an intern I am obviously at the bottom of the totem pole, so them firing me and me losing a reference would really be nothing to them.

I needed to confess this because I feel awful, and I fear that someone who works at that bar could be blamed for that missing bottle. I fear that the wonderful people I work with know, and feel betrayed. I fear I will lose my job over one stupid drunken impulse decision."

Sometimes they had boring classes where they'd spend the day surfing the internet without anything else. The teachers ranged from nice to insane but virtually none of them knew anything about computers, but they were forced to at least use PCs with Outlook.
The entire IT in that place was far from professional, but 90% of the problems I faced in my 4 months there were of the ""have you tried turning it off and on again"" nature.

One day my boss asked me to go to the one PC training classroom he himself wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole - he had made that clear to his bosses, i.e. he had said that that room desperately needed to either be dismantled or thoroughly upgraded. We had a small server (which was really nothing more than a current generation office PC) serving as a proxy, domain controller and fileserver in a small room between 2 classrooms that only teachers had access to. There even was a UPS attached to the ""server"".

Anyway, the aforementioned classroom was offline. The room was generally used for classes where students weren't listening to the teacher anyway and they just wanted to surf the internet. So my boss had gotten a call that the room was offline. This happened at least once a month so my boss gave me the key to the room and just said ""You'll probably just have to restart the server as usual"".

When I arrived there, the teacher told me there had been a power outage earlier and now the internet wasn't working anymore. When I entered the room, it didn't take long to figure out what happened. All cables attached to the UPS had been RIPPED OUT.

I have read so many stories like that in my time, but experiencing it firsthand was still pretty surreal. The power went out, so the UPS took over and started beeping. But instead of calling IT, the teacher went to unlock the ""server""-room, ripped all cables out of ""the beeping thing"" and went about his day. Only when his students complained that they can't get on facebook, calling IT became an option.

It's pretty funny in retrospect, especially since my boss didn't care about that room and he just laughed out loud (really loud) when I told him what happened."

We were together for 4 years, from the time I was 18 until I was 22. Two years into our relationship, he moved about 6 hours away to go to law school, but we maintained a  long distance relationship for two years, and it didn't diminish the significance of our relationship. 

I'd known him since I was six years old. He was my next-door neighbor for about a year; he and my younger brother were buddies. I have a lot of funny memories from that time, after-school Power Rangers, building forts with blankets and going to the moon, that sort of thing. Eventually, he moved away, as did my family. I saw him again when I was 14; he worked at a movie theater nearby. The chubby kid who was possessive with his ""magic rocks"" morphed into a skinny, industrial-music loving teenager with hair down to his ass. It was always kind of funny going to the theater and seeing him; he had no idea who I was but I remembered. When I began working at that same theater a few years later, it didn't take long for us to reconnect. We began dating a month before I graduated high school, and by June, I had my first boyfriend.

The first two years we were together, I was a mess, but looking back on it, I've never really had it together. High school, well, I did really well, but I spent some time with the wrong crowd. He was strictly against substance abuse, so I quit smoking pot and cigarettes (the cigarettes made their way back into my life though...it was an issue). When I moved out to go to college, I was extremely homesick. He transferred to the same university; I ended up living with him. At this point we had been together 3-4 months. Enter madness.

My mother began her rendez-vous with crack-cocaine that summer, and that little appointment ended up being a three-year marriage. She was a full-blown addict; a panhandler, lived in ""crackhouses"", sold her body. She lived the lifestyle. We wouldn't see her for months, she would show up so, so thin wearing the clothes I wore in middle school. She would leech off of my grandparents and then disappear. Eventually, she went to jail; she has been clean for 3 years. 

Meanwhile, at college, I was spent most of my time playing World of Warcraft, and doing well enough in school to keep my scholarships. Those years...it's funny to laugh about how insecure you are in your late-teens/early-twenties, but for a lot of people, that insecurity manifests itself in other ways. Food made me anxious, people made me anxious, he made my anxious. I was mean. MEAN, MEAN, MEAN. To him. And jealous...so jealous. And for what? What good does it do to be insecure when you significant other has female friends? It just pushes them away. And being that unhappy with your body that you would toss up your meals. I was a mess. My roommate, whom I love dearly, is at that age. I am 25 now. I tell her that it gets easier to love yourself. To understand who you are, what your strengths and shortcomings are, what you look like; the cellulite, the unibrow, the naivete, the cankles. She doesn't believe me. Insecurity doesn't completely go away for anyone, ever. But it diminishes as time goes on. I wish I had understood this when we were together or never understood it at all so I could never realize how awful I was. And he put up with me. To this day, I feel terrible; I am ashamed of a lot of things I did and said.

Naturally, after two years together with some pretty big issues, you decide whether or not you are going to part ways. He was pressing me to find my own place my junior year of college. He was getting ready to go off to law school somewhere. It was a good point in our relationship to break it off. We talked about it, we were both upset, but I insisted that I would change. 

*I can change, I can change, I can change. If it helps you fall in love.*

Heh. He was unconvinced, but things got better. And then he found out he got into a really school law school and would be an idiot to stay here in lieu of attending that school. Fuck it, I wasn't going to end it over him moving 6 hours away. I loved him. And as he said the evening before he left, if it doesn't work, it wouldn't be because of the distance. It just wasn't meant to be. And it wasn't.

For two years, we saw each other twice a month. I would drive up once a month for a weekend, and he would drive down two weeks later. We alternated holidays and breaks for the most part. We made it work. The first year of long distance, I lived in a dorm. I spent my days studying, working out, working in lab. I got my first scientific publication, decided I wanted to get my Ph.D in the biological sciences, so I worked at it. The second year we did long distance, I got my own apartment, and I made friends. I started to go out, to do my own thing, and that works when you have a significant other who lives 6 hours away. But when they're around, you feel obligated to stay home when you don't want to, and he wasn't the type to hang out with me and my friends. He didn't drink, and we were at different places in our lives. And when he came home to do a summer internship, I wasn't ready to settle back into the life I was living two years ago. After four years, it was over.

I know. I'm selfish. And I spent the summer numbing how I felt about the past four years, how much they meant to me, and how terribly it ended. I was a cunt. People tell you that you shouldn't feel bad for leaving something that wasn't working. But it was how I left it. There was no grace there. He deserved more than that. And I'm happy he found someone who deserves him. 

Three months after we broke up, I met a person who would spend the next year depleting a lot of things from me. He was a terrible person, but I it opened my eyes to a lot of things. It changed the way I treat people. And made me realize how terrible I was in my previous relationship. 

I wish I could write him up and apologize. For yelling at him over a parking pass, waking him at at 4 am and accusing him of cheating, for not going to Lego Land with him for his birthday, that I realize I was terrible, I know that. And I'm sorry. I would thank him for always telling me I was beautiful, and smart, and could do better than the mediocrity I immersed myself in. I'm happy he has found someone...and he should *never change, never change, never change.*

But I won't. We don't speak anymore.

*Edit* I guess I've painted a pretty sorry picture of myself. I broke up with said person 3 years ago. I do not have any residual romantic interest in this person; they were dead before it ended. I do not want to reconnect and ruin this person's relationship with someone. When I say I am happy for someone that does not mean I want to destroy the relationship they are currently in. When I say someone ""depleted a lot of things from me"", I mean they smothered me, hit me, called me any name under the sun, abused my cats, never let me be alone. They took away my ability to be elusive. I endured it because I thought I deserved it. I am the advice-giver to my friends, I have been single for a while, and the one boyfriend I did have told me I was ""a good catch, but he just couldn't see it."" He was ""never going to care about me as much as I cared about him"". I got something off my chest. I never had bad intentions. I just wanted to know that someone understood how I felt.

Sometimes people have problems, and sometimes people need a little help.

I live by those words.

I would love to work in a hotel, so I applied to a few internships at different hotels.  But I have been rejected every time. Earlier this week, I saw another great opening for an internship at a hotel, which was exactly what I was looking for. But because I feared I would get rejected again, I called the manager in charge of the hiring. I asked if the position was still open and she said it was, and then asked me what I was looking for and how long I would like to be working there, etc. I was kind of startled, as I was not expecting her to ask me anything. So I told her that I was looking to gain more experience and would love to get hired after that. But then she asked me if I was looking for an internship for school, which I am not. I am doing this purely for myself, to gain experience. She was really nice and explained that I would need an ""internship agreement"", and I should get one from my school. I emailed my teacher and asked if I would be able to get one, and she replied I couldn't get one. Because I already did an internship for school, I can't get another contract from my school. 

I am really eager to work in a hotel, so I am even considering to work as a maid or hotel restaurant employee. However, I am not sure if this would be relevant working experience for a future career in the hospitality business. So my question is, if I get a job in a hotel like a maid or restaurant employee, would I be able to move up to other divisions of a hotel? Or is there another way to get a internship agreement? I would love to do something in the line of duty management, where you have direct contact with guests and help them with any problems, But I have no relevant working experience and I am studying International Business Management. Which is another reason I am probably not being hired - no relevant educational background. I have had a reply before from one of the hotels I applied to that they are only looking for students from the ""hotel school"".
 
**TL;DR, I want to do an internship in a hotel. I need an internship agreement from school, but can't get one. Plus I have no relevant working experience and educational background. Would I be able to move up to other divisions of a hotel, working as a maid or restaurant employee? Is there another way to get a internship agreement?**

I would be fine moving out of state for awhile. Is it a bad idea to intern somewhere where you really do not intend on staying at?
1f3dqj,1,2013-05-26,WWOOFing experience in northern Michigan,[deleted],WWOOF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWOOF/comments/1f3dqj/wwoofing_experience_in_northern_michigan/,"ha!  I don't know why I am surprised to find a WWOOFing subreddit, but it's nice to see it here.  I just wanted to put in a plug for the Big Dipper Eco Farm in Kingsley, Michigan (more info available in the WWOOF directory).  

My now-fiance and I spent a week there.  Eric and Jackie were very gracious hosts.  We spent most of our working hours weeding, planting tomatoes, picking nasturtiums, beans, and lettuce (and triple washing in their spring water), feeding the geese, chasing the chickens out of the tobacco, etc.  That water was some of the sweetest water I've ever tasted.  My fiance spent some time digging a hole for an outhouse as well.  The work was hard, but the food was AMAZING.  Something about working your ass off makes anything delicious, I guess.  :)  I had never eaten a scape before, and now I'm irritated about how expensive they are at farmers' markets.  

At the farm, they work hard and they play hard.  On our days off, Jackie and Eric brought us to Sleeping Bear Dunes, to a super high sand dune that not too many tourists know about.  They also brought us kayaking one day.  Eric also had a sweet tip on preventing horsefly bites (involves daubing tanglefoot on an old plastic lid, and duct-taping it to your hat to catch those little jerks before they bite you).  On another day off, we caught the Cherry Festival in Traverse City.

Chores were shared, including cooking dinner, washing up, etc.  There was one ""intern"" who stayed there as well in a tent all summer.  We had full use of a little trailer that week.  

I have to say, though I love to garden, I am generally more of an indoorsy kind of girl.  There were some things that made me a bit squeamish, such as the outhouse (got used to that soon), jumping in their pond for a swim, and having to bail the water out of the shower when their septic tank got full.  However, these were very small downsides to what was all in all, a very pleasant experience for the two of us.   I would wholeheartedly recommend WOOFING at the Big Dipper Eco Farm, and feel free to PM me if you have any questions.  "

Generally I'll be okay, but sometimes I slip into a crazy mood swing and start snapping at people. Just earlier I snapped again and began verbally attacking my boyfriend for something that wasn't even his fault. I feel so terrible about it now but I don't even know why I reacted the way I did.

It's my third year in college and I'm very stressed out on getting an internship or summer job, neither is working out. I've also lost a lot of motivation for what I'm doing, and my grades are slipping. I still have a very high GPA but I feel like complete shit at what I'm doing now. Most of the times now I feel so worthless and tired, but I can't seem to get any motivation. I'd try to go for counselling but even that is falling out because school is ending and their almost fully booked. What are some things that I can do and how can I manage this properly?

I know how to work cubase and Pro Tools and will soon be teaching myself logic (as soon as I can afford it).

Now here's my thought process. My dream is to move and work in Nashville as a musician/audio engineer.

1f38ku,50,2013-05-26,"TIFU and broke my arm while arm-wrestling, paralyzing my wrist and fingers in the process.",The_Seldom_Seen_Kid,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1f38ku/tifu_and_broke_my_arm_while_armwrestling/,"I have to start off by saying that this didn’t happen today. Not yesterday, not last week even, but on this day precisely one year ago. However, I can still feel (or rather *not* feel) the consequences of it today, so I feel this post is somewhat justified.


To provide a little background: I had been on an internship in Paris for the past three months and everything was going absolutely swell. I made some great friends, professionally things couldn’t be better and overall I had a blast spending time abroad alone for the first time in my life. Being in Paris just added to that experience. To quote my man Ernest: 
“If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.” Anyway, I digress. 


The residence I stayed at had its own little gym so I had been working out religiously during my time there. I was really getting into shape and becoming stronger. Of course, with added power comes added cockiness so when a friend challenged me to a game of arm-wrestling one lovely Saturday night I immediately accepted, gloating about his incumbent demise.


*I got this.*


Turns out, I didn’t. We had been going at it for a good 30 seconds and I was at a small advantage but this dude was still not giving in. Apparently, slightly inebriated Germans are rather strong. Me being extremely sober thought that I could maybe wear him out enough so that he would just give up. This didn’t seem to work and I tried to give it one last push with all my measly strength.


Then it happened. CRACK. THUD. ARGH.  My arm loudly banged against the table, in the opposite direction mind you. I didn’t realize what just had happened but my body sure as hell did. I couldn’t control myself and started yelling incoherent sounds, all the while breathing very loudly. The pain was very intense but started numbing down quickly when I sat down again. Whenever I tried moving my arm, it started twitching. Honestly I just thought I had torn a muscle or something.


An ambulance was called in and I was soon rushed to hospital. I was checked in and told to wait. Overall I had to wait for 4 hours in the ER which wasn’t the most pleasant of experiences. (During that time I saw a guy with a beret strapped to a stretcher trying to fight two nurses because they called him monsieur while he’d rather be called madame. Aah, Paris, comme je vous adore)


Anyway, when someone finally came to see what kind of dire straits I had gotten myself into, they just started berating me. I was a blithering idiot for arm-wrestling, I had been the third guy that month with the same injuries (didn’t even know you could break your arm while arm-wrestling, let alone that this wasn’t a very rare freak accident). In the meantime, my arm had swollen to Schwarzenegger proportions and the guy examining me asked if I was on steroids. No thanks, I wasn’t. He told me I had broken my humerus and that I needed surgery asap. Great.


The next morning I had surgery and the surgeon came to me afterwards and said everything had gone over smoothly and that I should be as good as new in a few weeks. However, I still couldn’t move my arm after two weeks and the doctors concluded that they probably had severed a nerve. (Maybe the surgeon can post a TIFU from his perspective)


Long story short, my wrist and fingers were paralyzed for 7 months and only in the last few months have I been making progress. I still have a pretty bad-ass scar and a few insensitive spots on my arm to make me remember my fuck up.

**TL;DR: don’t arm-wrestle guys, it’s not worth it.**

1f37yj,12,2013-05-26,"I (M 24) love cheating. Or rather, I love the thrill of the chase and bedding a new girl.",[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1f37yj/i_m_24_love_cheating_or_rather_i_love_the_thrill/,"Basically what the title says, but I've got quite a wall of text to expand on my situation. Bear with me.

I don't know if it's that I love cheating so much as I love the thrill of the chase. That feeling of finding a girl, getting to know her, flirting, exchanging texts at all hours of the day, and finally hooking up... I love it. It's my drug of choice. Then after we've had our fun a couple of times, it's on to the next girl. Most of the time it's mutual, other times I'm a complete piece of shit and crush the girl.

It started with my first girlfriend. We started dating when we were both 16, until we were 18. During the last 3-4 months of our relationship, we both started to realize it wasn't going to work. We were graduating in a few weeks, going to different colleges, pursuing different life goals. We stuck it out as long as we could because we didn't know any better.

With the fact that we were doomed no matter what looming over me, my mind started to wander. One of my older friends took me to see one of my favorite bands as a graduation gift. (Queens of the Stone Age, front row, amazing show) Anyway, at the concert, I met this really cute girl that was standing behind me during the show. Before the opening act, we started to flirt and make small talk. Between sets, it kept going, and I let her get in front of me for Queens because I'm pretty tall. The show got loud and crazy, and our bodies were close the entire show. I put my arms around her waist at one point because of the insane moshing behind us, and she held them there. It was the first time I'd had any type of romantic contact with a girl other than my girlfriend in like 2 years. Just having my arms around her waist just blew me away. We ended up holding hands through the rest of the show, on and off.

After it was all over, we exchanged numbers, and immediately started texting while my friend and I were driving home. It started innocently enough, getting to know each other and whatnot. Found out she was my age, about to graduate, single, all kinds of stuff that attracted me to her. We began texting and talking on the phone almost non-stop. I, of course, never mentioned my girlfriend. There was no motive for this. I honestly greatly enjoyed talking to her, and it was clear she had a crush on me. The chances of us never talking again were too high to tell her.

A week or two passed, and we wanted to see each other. Problem was, she lived an hour and a half away. She didn't have a car, and I didn't have the most reliable vehicle in the world. One night, I threw caution to the wind and drove up to see her. She lived with her mom, who was out of the state seeing an ill family member, or something. We had the house, and weekend to ourselves. I knew what this meant. I KNEW what would happen if I went up there. I told my parents that some friends and I were spending the weekend at a friend's place, not doing a damn thing but play video games, order pizza, and act like hooligans. We did this a couple weekends a month, so they bit. On the other hand, I told my girlfriend that me and the friend who took me to the concert were going on a little road trip. She believed me, and even packed me a sweet little care package to have on the trip. A cute gesture that I gave zero fucks about...

Anyway, I get to the girl's house, and it's awesome. We didn't do anything but hug at first. We hung out, talked, went on a midnight snack run, and spent most of the night and early morning watching movies, flirting, and all that good stuff. We finally start getting serious, and the first kiss happened. It was heaven. I loved it. I loved everything about it. The fact that she was hot, a good kisser, and the fact that I was getting some on the side.

Now I guess I should mention that I had a healthy sex life with my girlfriend. It wasn't mind-blowing by any means, but it was good. I wasn't starved for sex.

Eventually kissing turned into making out, which turned in to going to her bed, which turned into getting naked. You see where this is going. We didn't have a condom, so it ended with the both of us getting each other off orally. She wasn't BETTER than my girlfriend, just different. And I loved it. She swallowed, which is no big deal to me, but it wasn't something my girlfriend did. She came multiple times when I went down on her. Again, something my girlfriend didn't do. It was insanely hot. We spent the weekend together, got condoms for the next night, had crazy sex, barely slept a wink. We spent almost the whole weekend naked and doing some kind of sexual activity.

This post is getting pretty goddamn long, so I'll wrap it up soon, I swear.

This carried on for a while. It came to an end when she couldn't deal with me being far away, and on the verge of being further when I left for college. I essentially had two girlfriends. Long story short, both of them ended and I went off to college.

Freshman year, I met an astoundingly beautiful girl and we started dating. We fell in love, and it was the happiest I had ever been. Freshman year, sophomore year, junior year... it was all perfect. She was the prettiest girl I'd ever met, perfect in a million ways, the girl I knew I was going to marry. And yet the entire time we were together, my mind wandered. When we weren't hanging out, I actively thought of what it'd be like to hook up with other girls. I never pursued it, or rather, never got the chance to. But I look back on it and don't doubt for a second that I would gotten down with the first girl that came my way that wanted it.

As great as our relationship was, it came to a screeching halt before my senior year. She'd just graduated, and came clean that she couldn't see herself marrying my with my career path. I was majoring in theatre arts, and constantly in plays/musicals. I had a paid internship with a local theater that was going to become my real job upon graduation. She couldn't deal with my hectic lifestyle. The travelling, the late nights, etc. We broke up. I was utterly devastated, and severely depressed. I was madly in love with her and she broke my heart. I took to easy bar girls, dating sites, and girls I'd been wanting to bone for years to relieve myself. At any given time I was ""dating"" 2-3 girls at once, and hooking up with some rando from a bar every night of the weekend. Every time, it was the fact that it was a new girl that got me off. The chase, the thrill of new experiences. 75% of the time the sex was bad, but I didn't care.

Fast-forward.

I graduate, get into the professional world, get over my breakup, meet a real girl, fall in love, we move in together.

Present Day: We've been together for 2 years, lived together for almost a year. We're in love, happy, comfortable... it's all good. We have an amazing dog, she's a fellow actress, and we both run a theater and theatre-troupe in my city. Living the dream.
But I still can't go a day without wanting to jump the bones of the first girl that gives me a real shot. In my profession, it's not hard to find that. I've done the right thing and said ""no"" on two separate occasions since we've been together. I get cast in plays typically as the guy with a love interest. It's my type. Fitting... right...?

So occasionally that actress will come along who takes our stage relationship too far, and develops a crush. I, admittedly, develop it too, but restrain myself because I love my girlfriend. It's a struggle. A ridiculously hard struggle. The fact that I have to kiss other women all the time in plays doesn't help. Sometimes during the rehearsal process, those kisses become a little bit more real than just stage kisses. It would take only a word for me to take that kiss further sometimes.
I'm terrified that I'm going to ruin the best relationship of my life by giving in to a 'fetish' I've had since I was a kid. I love my life, my apartment, my job, my girlfriend, my dog... and I'd love just about all of it if I cheated. And sometimes, I don't care. That terrifies me. How could I be so willing to throw what I have away just to experience that rush? Is it sex addiction? Am I just a horrible person?

**TL;DR I cheated on my first real girlfriend, and have since been plagued with the desire to cheat in all of my relationships, current girlfriend included. It effects my daily life in that it's something I think about way too often, and I'm scared that I'll end up throwing everything away by giving into a problem I developed during my teen years.**"

Sometimes the renovations are for the current owners and the current owners only, so much that even in mint condition, it's a gut job. It runs the gamut...
[Given the nature of NYC real estate, does it obey any market law?   It's chaos when you're dealing with that kind of money, no? Like, how much do you want something, as opposed to what is the intrinsic worth.  How can you even begin to price anything?  Are comps all over the place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|Au contraire. The stock-ticker like nature of the market, and the number of trades make it much easier to establish a value, spot trends, analyze them and apply all sorts of other metrics (check THIS out: [Link to www.millersamuel.com](http://www.millersamuel.com/browse-all-charts))
[What's another international city on par with or outstripping NYC in terms of stratospheric real estate price?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|New York is by no means the record-setter worldwide. Hong Kong is nearly 3x NYC, Tokyo 2x, London and Paris are almost peers, but London is setting some records at present.
[I glance at some NYC real estate reality TV sometimes (just glance at, I swear!\)  Those characters come off as horrible, shallow, pretentious, but very beautiful people.  Is that anything close to real life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|Sometimes. It's all about how you present. I consider ""the look"" giving the least number of reasons to object to you. I don't wear cologne, because I'd rather have no smell than one that someone finds unpleasant. I always wear a suit, because no one will really judge you for wearing a suit, but jeans and a blazer, you may be underdressed. You have to look like you're put together enough to handle millions of someone's dollars. If you can't brush your teeth and comb your hair...but then, there is a contingent of showiness.

[Given the exorbitant price of NYC real estate, and the type of people and the professions that can afford it, do you think eventually the ""normal"" people and professions would be priced completely out of the market there, creating what will be an essentially a segregated Huxleyan society?  Do you think that's bad or not impactful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6c7ul?context=5)|A reasonable point, and it is happening. That's why we're seeing the gentrification of Harlem, the building boom in Long Island City, Brooklyn (Park Slope and Williamsburg ESPECIALLY), and even these places are trading at very near Manhattan prices. While it's not the healthiest for society (IMHO), I'm not sure what else can be done to control it. There are incentives for developers to include affordable housing contingents and the like, but that can be counterproductive for the developer. There are proposals by Christine Quinn to add large amounts of affordable housing, but I'm not enough of an economist to consider the long term effects of either.
[What do you see as the main differences between this and being a more normal financial range realtor? And for the clients? Do you see any changes with increased online services (either as competition, or as enhancements that you use/offer your clients\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6a7zy?context=5)|I actually started have worked very successfully in both markets.
 |The biggest difference is the role that you play, where in the ""typical"" market, you are more of a ""friend"", invited over for dinner, housewarming parties, and the hokey balloons on the yard sign open house works. Also, without implying that people are not smart, in the typical market, your clients are more blue-collar and look to you for ALL types of business advice. In the market where you're dealing with people who are plunking down $10-20 million in cash, you're merely a service provider/assistant, and generally to amass that kind of money (trust fund kids aside), the client is much smarter than I am.
 |Functioning in the multi-million dollar range, you are at once a concierge, investment adviser, marketer, negotiator, personal assistant. It takes a level of humility to be simultaneously very successful and simultaneously give firm opinions while remaining somewhat subservient. It's takes finesse to balance it all with 20,000 competitors fighting for under 10,000 sales per year.
 |There has been a HUGE change in the role you play in light of the availability of information. New York real estate trades like a stock. The world's eyes are on it, and if there's a good buy, there's an ask, and from somewhere in the world, there will be a bid. The values fluctuate (e.g. up +/-26% since January) so much that you have to talk people out of considering what someone paid for an apartment 3 years ago. The price of AAPL today is completely independent of the price 3 years ago, and NYC real estate is the same. The inventory is finite, as it's a relatively small rock, so it's very supply and demand driven.
 |Suburban markets are much different, as there aren't organized bus trips to, say, Tacoma, Washington, for wealthy BRIC country investors to go property shopping. New York is one of very few markets that operate completely outside of a vacuum.
[Well written.  Just curious, what made you use Tacoma, WA as an example?  That's where I'm from and I was just wondering.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6mw9m?context=5)|Completely and utterly pulled out of thin air.
[I don't follow the appeal of NYC to the international set. Obviously a place to do business. And cultural institutions in Manhattan. Do those who buy high end apartments ever leave Manhattan? Where do they go other than JFK? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f2wcv/iama_one_of_the_top_highend_real_estate_brokers/ca6aig5?context=5)|The international set is what drives the New York market to the values they're at, consider that the area of a sheet of paper laid on the floor of a middle high-end building is valued at about $1,000.
 |New York is arguably the business and fashion capital of the world, moving up in the tech sector, still active in entertainment, although secondary to LA.
 |It's a place to park hard assets in a relatively safe and historically appreciating market, but most importantly is inventory. Manhattan is a rock, and there is practically no undeveloped land south of 96th Street (""Prime"" Manhattan), so to add inventory you've got to remove inventory (commercial or residential). The market will never be saturated with inventory in such a way that the supply far exceeds the demand...in theory. It's also a well branded commodity.
 |And, then, of course, sometimes it just feels cool for a Japanese businessman to say he has an apartment Trump ___ amongst his friends.

I'm lucky enough to deal in the high end, but the ""low end"" is my day-to-day for sure.
 |But, general suggestions for the good of the gander, do have a broker. You can sometimes negotiate directly with the listing broker, but the relationship the listing broker has with their clients transcends yours, and you'll never actually know if the discount you got was a break in the brokerage fee.
 |Decide whether light and views are more important than space, as these are the two things that will focus your search, and what you're actually paying for.
 |The price you pay to live in Manhattan, in my opinion, is for convenience, so if you're moving for work, move fairly close to work. I can't fathom being an owner of an apartment in NYC and still having a 45-minute commute.
 |Get pre-qualified for a mortgage in advance. Have a letter indicating that. The market is so fast right now from the sell off at the end of 2012 that you've got to be prepared to look and decide quick. If you love the first one you see, make an offer. Negotiate. Immediately look at 5 more apartments to ensure you're comfortable. If you still feel the same way about the first, go to town. If not, keep going.

 |These mega-listings were all precipitated by the $88 million sale at 15 Central Park West.
 |If the penthouse is worth $125 million, what's the floor below it worth? $100 million? and the floor below, and so on.
 |If it does, it will likely be an overseas buyer, and it will be a purchase that has nothing to do with value (there is nothing functionally that you couldn't get for $5-10 million in another building), but mostly ego.

1f368x,0,2013-05-26,"I (M24) love cheating. Or I just love the thrill of the chase, and bedding a new girl.",[deleted],confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1f368x/i_m24_love_cheating_or_i_just_love_the_thrill_of/,"Basically what the title says, but I've got quite a wall of text to expand on my situation. Bear with me.

I don't know if it's that I love cheating so much as I love the thrill of the chase. That feeling of finding a girl, getting to know her, flirting, exchanging texts at all hours of the day, and finally hooking up... I love it. It's my drug of choice. Then after we've had our fun a couple of times, it's on to the next girl. Most of the time it's mutual, other times I'm a complete piece of shit and crush the girl.

It started with my first girlfriend. We started dating when we were both 16, until we were 18. During the last 3-4 months of our relationship, we both started to realize it wasn't going to work. We were graduating in a few weeks, going to different colleges, pursuing different life goals. We stuck it out as long as we could because we didn't know any better.

With the fact that we were doomed no matter what looming over me, my mind started to wander. One of my older friends took me to see one of my favorite bands as a graduation gift. (Queens of the Stone Age, front row, amazing show) Anyway, at the concert, I met this really cute girl that was standing behind me during the show. Before the opening act, we started to flirt and make small talk. Between sets, it kept going, and I let her get in front of me for Queens because I'm pretty tall. The show got loud and crazy, and our bodies were close the entire show. I put my arms around her waist at one point because of the insane moshing behind us, and she held them there. It was the first time I'd had any type of romantic contact with a girl other than my girlfriend in like 2 years. Just having my arms around her waist just blew me away. We ended up holding hands through the rest of the show, on and off.

After it was all over, we exchanged numbers, and immediately started texting while my friend and I were driving home. It started innocently enough, getting to know each other and whatnot. Found out she was my age, about to graduate, single, all kinds of stuff that attracted me to her. We began texting and talking on the phone almost non-stop. I, of course, never mentioned my girlfriend. There was no motive for this. I honestly greatly enjoyed talking to her, and it was clear she had a crush on me. The chances of us never talking again were too high to tell her. 

A week or two passed, and we wanted to see each other. Problem was, she lived an hour and a half away. She didn't have a car, and I didn't have the most reliable vehicle in the world. One night, I threw caution to the wind and drove up to see her. She lived with her mom, who was out of the state seeing an ill family member, or something. We had the house, and weekend to ourselves. I knew what this meant. I KNEW what would happen if I went up there. I told my parents that some friends and I were spending the weekend at a friend's place, not doing a damn thing but play video games, order pizza, and act like hooligans. We did this a couple weekends a month, so they bit. On the other hand, I told my girlfriend that me and the friend who took me to the concert were going on a little roadtrip. She believed me, and even packed me a sweet little care package to have on the trip. A cute gesture that I gave zero fucks about...

Anyway, I get to the girl's house, and it's awesome. We didn't do anything but hug at first. We hung out, talked, went on a midnight snack run, and spent most of the night and early morning watching movies, flirting, and all that good stuff. We finally start getting serious, and the first kiss happened. It was heaven. I loved it. I loved everything about it. The fact that she was hot, a good kisser, and the fact that I was getting some on the side. 

Now I guess I should mention that I had a healthy sex life with my girlfriend. It wasn't mind-blowing by any means, but it was good. I wasn't starved for sex.

Eventually kissing turned into making out, which turned in to going to her bed, which turned into getting naked. You see where this is going. We didn't have a condom, so it ended with the both of us getting each other off orally. She wasn't BETTER than my girlfriend, just different. And I loved it. She swallowed, which is no big deal to me, but it wasn't something my girlfriend did. She came multiple times when I went down on her. Again, something my girlfriend didn't do. It was insanely hot. We spent the weekend together, got condoms for the next night, had crazy sex, barely slept a wink. We spent almost the whole weekend naked and doing some kind of sexual activity. 

This post is getting pretty goddamn long, so I'll wrap it up soon, I swear.

This carried on for a while. It came to an end when she couldn't deal with me being far away, and on the verge of being further when I left for college. I essentially had two girlfriends. Long story short, both of them ended and I went of to college.

Freshman year, I met an astoundingly beautiful girl and we started dating. We fell in love, and it was the happiest I had ever been. Freshman year, sophomore year, junior year... it was all perfect. She was the prettiest girl I'd ever met, perfect in a million ways, the girl I knew I was going to marry. And yet the entire time we were together, my mind wandered. When we weren't hanging out, I actively thought of what it'd be like to hook up with other girls. I never pursued it, or rather, never got the chance to. But I look back on it and don't doubt for a second that I would gotten down with the first girl that came my way that wanted it. 

As great as our relationship was, it came to a screeching halt before my senior year. She'd just graduated, and came clean that she couldn't see herself marrying my with my career path. I was majoring in theatre arts, and constantly in plays/musicals. I had a paid internship with a local theatre that was going to become my real job upon graduation. She couldn't deal with my hectic lifestyle. The travelling, the late nights, etc. We broke up. I was utterly devastated, and severely depressed. I was madly in love with her and she broke my heart. I took to easy bar girls, dating sites, and girls I'd been wanting to bone for years to relieve myself. At any given time I was ""dating"" 2-3 girls at once, and hooking up with some rando from a bar every night of the weekend. Every time, it was the fact that it was a new girl that got me off. The chase, the thrill of new experiences. 75% of the time the sex was bad, but I didn't care. 

Fast-forward.

I graduate, get into the professional world, get over my breakup, meet a real girl, fall in love, we move in together.

Present Day: We've been together for 2 years, lived together for almost a year. We're in love, happy, comfortable... it's all good. We have an amazing dog, she's a fellow actress, and we both run a theater and theatre-troupe in my city. Living the dream.

But I still can't go a day without wanting to jump the bones of the first girl that gives me a real shot. In my profession, it's not hard to find that. I've done the right thing and said ""no"" on two separate occasions since we've been together. I get cast in plays typically as the guy with a love interest. It's my type. Fitting... right...?

So occasionally that actress will come along who takes out stage relationship too far, and develops a crush. I, admittedly, develop it too, but restrain myself because I love my girlfriend. It's a struggle. A ridiculously hard struggle. The fact that I have to kiss other women all the time in plays doesn't help. Sometimes during the rehearsal process, those kisses become a little bit more real than just stage kisses. It would take only a word for me to take that kiss further sometimes.

I'm terrified that I'm going to ruin the best relationship of my life by giving in to a 'fetish' I've had since I was a kid. I love my life, my apartment, my job, my girlfriend, my dog... and I'd love just about all of it if I cheated. And sometimes, I don't care. That terrifies me. How could I be so willing to throw what I have away just to experience that rush? Is it sex addiction? Am I just a horrible person?

**TL;DR** 
**I cheated on my first real girlfriend, and have since been plagued with the desire to cheat in all of my relationships, current girlfriend included. It effects my daily life in that it's something I think about way too often, and I'm scared that I'll end up throwing everything away by giving into a problem I developed during my teen years.**"

The internship (not uncommonly) pays like shit, and I'm wondering if there's anything else I can do to supplement my income a little. 

The problem is my visa will only allow me to work jobs related to my field of study (public policy/political science). That means waitressing, (most) transcribing, babysitting/housesitting/dogwalking through an agency aren't really available to me.

I have skills/experience in writing, media and social science research. I'm fluent in Mandarin and a great typist. I'm willing to put in work and time, but don't have much flexibility with the latter since I'm already employed full-time. So it'd have to be an evening job/on my own time, but not many of those are related to public policy.

I'm not sure where to start looking, but I was wondering if you all might have any ideas. I could babysit/etc independently and just get paid under the radar. Or I could be formally employed, but would have to find an unusual job to fit the bill. Any ideas on the options I might have?"

I already own a charcoal suit with a slight pinstripe, so I'm looking to get a navy suit without one so that I'll have two suit options to alternate between. Since I'm a 19-year-old college student I'm looking to keep the budget strictly under $200 for the suit itself (I already own shirts/ties/shoes, so that's not an issue).

I'm 6'0"", 135-140 lbs, jacket size 36 (at least according to the tuxedo rental place that measured me recently), pants size 31/33. I'm looking for a two-button, solid navy suit that will last me through the summer (8 week internship, so figure about 20-25 days of wearing it) and occasional use after that.

The local cheap suits place where I got my last suit feels a little bit like  walking into a used car dealership (""$149 for a suit and 3 shirts and 5 ties!"" or something crazy like that is their Memorial Day weekend sale, and they're extremely pushy), so I'd prefer to find something that's probably a little higher quality (although I don't expect much for $200 of course).

However, I won't stop people from posting; just don't digress into other stuff.

I'm a Christian from Singapore. There's a movement here called House of Prayer Singapore, which was birthed from a prayer/worship movement from another group. I've been following this group for a long time now, ever since it started, but I was never really very intimately related to the people or the movement itself.

I found it to be okay because most of the time we're singing praises to God, worshipping Him and basically just praying and interceding for the nation. However, there are a couple of guys who went to IHOP KC and did internship there, and that's where my question starts.

It's been hotly debated with my leaders(One for the group, the other against), and I just want an honest opinion from everyone. I'm planning to go IHOP-KC in the future.

tl;dr Read first paragraph, and tell me what you think of IHOP-KC.

EDIT: I have opt to speak with my leader this weekend(7 days from now; I'm living at GMT +8). I'm sorry if my words were a bit critical, but I assure you that I love every one of you here because Jesus loves. I might not be able to reply as frequent from now on, but keep it coming! God bless!"

Recent EE graduate here looking for some advice.  I'm looking to break into the controls industry.  I've applied to quite a few junior controls type positions and been having some pretty decent success (probably a result of good grades/industrial internships).  About a week ago, I got a callback for a position I applied to labelled PLC Programmer.  I was interviewed and quite rapidly got an offer.  The compensation is quite fair, and the location is somewhere I'm interested in living... however I'm unsure if this is really an ""engineering"" position.   From what I've seen online, PLC programmer seems to be more of a ""technician"" job.

I'm just here to ask if this would be a good ""get your feet wet"" type of position for someone with my intended career path.  I've noted that A LOT of controls positions require ""PLC Programming Knowledge"" so it seems like I'm going to have to get this training one way or the other before I can get a controls engineering position.

UVA: Excellent school. I walk out with around a 3.0 or a bit lower. Probably wouldn't have gotten an internship due to competition. Maybe a bit of research experience. But the reputation of the school looks really good.

GMU: Probably would have gotten a 3.8-4.0, depending, which means many more honors/rewards. At the worst, 3.5-3.6.

I'd be either couchsurfing or staying in hostels in London and Istanbul to cut down on cost (I've looked and hostels in both places shouldn't run me more than $400 total). I'm a little concerned about money because flights that I'm looking at are totaling about half or more of my budget, but this is my tentative itinerary:

*August 4: Fly out of NYC to London

*August 5-10: London

*August 11: Fly out of London to Istanbul; meet a friend at our hostel in Istanbul 

*August 12-23: Istanbul

*August 24: Fly out of Istanbul to London, travel from London to Edinburgh (I'd prefer to train up because I've heard that the scenery is breathtaking)

*August 25-29: Stay in Edinburgh with another friend  

*August 30: Travel from Edinburgh to London, fly from London to NYC

The trip to London in the beginning was sort of an add-on after I realized that my friend would be in Edinburgh, because the round-trip flights from NYC to London and London to Istanbul are cheaper than doing individual flights when I've looked.

1. web dev on an as needed basis for expanding the tools of the ecampus (database of student records, generic class websites, etc.) with the head of the CS department


2. Research opportunity for ""students interested in wearable computing"" (Google Glass, Nike Fuel Band, etc.) that lasts 9 months followed by a 3 month summer internship

Both have about the same hours and the pay is similar (within $5/hour of each other).

Pros for #1:

* Great for networking even though I do not plan on going into academia
* Good rep in the department for future research opportunities

Pros for #2:

* 3 month internship at the end of the 2013-14 school year - this is not a big factor to me as I have internships for next summer covered if I do not choose this program. I haven't been told where the internship is at, but my money is on Texas Instruments because they are funding the research project.
* 9 months of part time work on my resume

I am leaning towards option #1 since I like the head of the department, but #2 sounds like a more fun and interesting experience if the internship at the end of it was optional. Any ideas for what might look better on a resume?

As stated in the title, I'm between my second and third years of college and about to begin a summer internship in finance. I'll earn ~13k total this summer. I've been reading about the Roth IRA and want to start one with my summer income by contributing the yearly maximum of $5.5k. So far, I see no downsides, but would appreciate any input from those with more experience/knowledge. Some more facts:

- I am debt-free and have pristine credit (I started building credit history in high school by piggybacking on parents' accounts).
- I will not be taking out any student loans before graduation.
- I don't expect needing to withdraw anything from the Roth IRA in the foreseeable future, but certainly not any more than the original contribution if so.
- I will very likely be doing another internship next summer with the same (or slightly more) approximate pay, and contributing the yearly maximum to the Roth IRA then as well.
- I plan to start working immediately after graduation.

So my understanding is that the main benefit is that I'm saving post-tax earnings, and since my taxes in the future will be higher than they are now, it's 'cheaper' to save now in the Roth IRA and let compound interest work its magic. And since I'm free to withdraw up to my original contribution at any point without tax/penalty, there's no issue with me locking in the money and it can still serve as a back-up to my back-up emergency savings. Am I missing anything? Is there any risk/con to starting a Roth IRA now that I'm overlooking? Any general input would be welcome; I'm new to all this - just trying to make myself financially literate and set myself up for the future as best as I can. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Also, does it matter at all where I open the Roth IRA? I was thinking Charles Schwab, since I already have an investment account with them, but my parents said their 401(k)s are with Fidelity. It looks like Fidelity charges $1 less per equity trade, but that's an inconsequential difference, right? I've seen a few posters here recommend starting a Roth IRA with Vanguard -- any reasons why?"

Creating an account to post because there's nowhere else that I can ask for help.

I started interning at a prestigious organisation two weeks back. The workdays are about 14 hours long and it's very very tiring but I don't really mind that since I've always been borderline workaholic and I am very excited about the opportunities that having this work experience on my resume will open up for me.

During the interview, I was told that I would be working on something research-related but my supervisor's supervisor (let's call her SS because that's appropriate in so many ways) assigned me to something else. SS wanted me to develop something without any clear instructions - she said that she didn't want to give me instructions and limit what I would do. She also said that I should look at an older version of the same and make changes to it and essentially retain the format. 

After two weeks of slaving away, I presented the results to her on Thursday. She barely looked at it and started yelling at me about how I hadn't changed the format and how it looked the same as the last one. I told her that all the changes that had been made - of which there were quite a few - had been marked out on the sheet. She then proceeded to draw what she wanted on another sheet of paper and said that's what she expected me to produce. Without her telling me that I would have never been able to guess that that's what she wanted. All of this is done in the middle of the office with everyone watching. The last straw was when she said that I was stupid - there were audible gasps from people around me.

I have never worked in an organisation before. I have only worked in research labs before this and the culture there was very different and appreciative. I am conscientious and have never been accused of being tardy or lazy. I don't think I am stupid because I have been a straight A student since I was a kid and at the age of 22, I have co-authored two research publications.

But her insults have really affected me. I have been unable to sleep over the last couple of days. I dread going back to work on Monday.
I cannot quit because it's too late to apply elsewhere and I need the work experience. The permanent staff at the firm told me that SS is a bully and that she insults people in the office all the time. She treats a guy with a PhD in Math as her PA. They advised me to stand up to her but I just cannot do that - I am terrible at confrontation and I am really scared that she would give me a bad internship report and mess up my chances of advancement in the field. 

I don't know if I can seek a solution to the whole thing. I know that a lot of people have horrible bosses and would be grateful to you if you could tell me how you dealt with a similar sitation. Also, could someone please try and help me see the positive in this situation? I used to be borderline depressive many years ago and this incident has really sent me into a downward spiral again. Please tell me what I can learn from this and how I can become a stronger better person at the end of this experience. 

I am sorry about the rant but if I try to edit this, I know I won't post it. "

I'm a girl in the middle of an engineering degree at a top 10 university.  Everything I've read, everyone I've talked to, everything I expected based on the guys I've dealt with in my classes- everything lead me to believe that entering the workforce, I'd encounter sexism, in forms ranging from really blatant to the things being documented at the Everyday Sexism Project.  I resolved a while ago to do what I could to stop it, but had mostly resigned myself to figuring out a way to deal with it.  I really wanted to be an engineer, and sexism seemed to be something that came with a tech career.

So I was nervous when my boss introduced me to the group I'd be working with this summer, because I was *literally* the only girl working with the group.

Ladies, I couldn't be working with a more welcoming and accepting group.  I'm four days in and I've already been given some useful projects to complete (it isn't mind-numbing intern photocopying work!)  I was told, by three separate people, that they'd be more than willing to make themselves available if I needed advice or someone to bounce ideas off of, but that they knew I'd be able to handle the tasks on my own.  In meetings, they ask my opinion, and they stop to explain anything I might not know (lots of acronyms, mostly).  I feel young and inexperienced, but I don't feel conspicuously female.  I feel like an engineer, and it's because they're treating me as one.

I mostly wanted to share because I see a lot of sexist interactions documented by people on this sub- and of course, I get angry and indignant on any such poster's behalf.  It's important to call such interactions out.  But I'm just so happy and so relieved that I lucked out by joining an amazing team for the summer that I wanted to shout my elation from the rooftops!"

I'm a 20 yr. old male in college. I am 5'5"" or so, skinny, and white. Money is, fortunately, not an issue, but I feel quite uncomfortable sporting attires that have big names and logos covering them. I'm a quaint, down-to-earth person who's just looking for a little change - nothing to wow or dazzle here.

**Advice Needed:**

I'm going to be doing an internship this summer, and I'm looking to perhaps step away from what has been my persistent t-shirt and jeans combo with the occasional sweatshirt on colder days. I don't intend to never wear them again, but I'd like a slight change.

The internship is in a research lab in New England, but I will be in a control room-type setting dealing entirely with computers/programming and math, so I don't have to worry about spilled chemicals or anything. 

While I'm sure many scientists don't give a damn how they look and don't care how I look either, I'd like to wear something casual but not quite as ""grungy"" as a t-shirt and jeans. At the same time, I don't want to suit up, as there's no dress code, and that would seem out of place in a lab setting that I believe dresses fairly casual as a whole. I'm fine with wearing (dark) colored jeans unless I find other suggestions I prefer, but my main issue is I'm not really sure what to wear shirt-wise.

I smoke marijuana pretty regularly (~2-3 times a week, if I have nothing going on), and I know that I would test positive if I were to submit to a drug test.

In other words, I am more than willing to cease any/all drug use if it turns out that I need to. I really do care about this job, it's in a field that I am interested in and it would be incredibly foolish to miss this opportunity due to something other than my ability as a software engineer.

So, my question is this: how prevalent is drug testing in software engineering? Is this something that I need to plan for? Or is it not really an issue?

-How can I travel on an extreme budget, I've like to visit all of europe/parts of asia, I wouldn't mind working. 
-Did you find a job straight away after college? What was your experience like. 

Thank you

1f5qcq,4,2013-05-27,I quit my job.,flavornic,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1f5qcq/i_quit_my_job/,"I did this program at school where I went to two different universities this past year, one each semester. The first university I went to, Umass, was the best thing that has ever happen to me. However, I chose to leave there to go to another university to get a 'different' experience, the U of Utah.

I hated Utah. The first couple weeks I was there I was trying to get a job, and I about did at a elementary school as an after school coach, but I turned it down for an internship I was then interviewing for. I really thought I was gonna get it, the guy basically told me I had it. I didn't. The school job was long gone now too.

That was just to add to my frustration, but a long story short: I had another internship lined up legitimately for the summer at the Virgin Islands, but I turned it down to do a door to door job promising to make 20k+.

Three weeks into the job, I quit it and now I have no job. I will end up working in a factory 10+ hours a day in my hometown, and on top of this every other salesman working there right now is on pace to make 20k+, I just couldn't pick it up. I feel embarrassed and defeated. 

I also brought my bestfriend out there with me who is also on pace to make 20k. I will be working in a factory making tops, 6-7k this summer. FML"

She is the most gorgeous person I have ever been with and I love her. We have been together and friends for over a year. I know that is such a short amount of time, but still. We have a tendency to fight a lot. She is jealous and insecure and hates any friends I have that are girls. One of my closest friends was a girl and my relationship with that friend has been ruined because of her, but all I thought at the moment was what does it matter that friend hasn't done much for me and my girlfriend does everything for me. She hated the fact I smoked weed during the day times so I started to cut down and I don't smoke. She told me she hated me smoking hookah even though I would smoke about once a week, but I stopped. Of course she also does things for me, she used to work as a shot girl at a bar and I told her I thought that was trashy wearing skanky outfits and having to deal with guys flirting with you all night so she quit. Currently we are on two separate sides of the US but I got an internship in her hometown which I wish to take so we can be together over the summer. She recently went away on a trip for about a week with her family and we couldn't talk or anything. When she was gone I smoked and stupidly when she got back I casually told her. I told her I was sorry and I shouldn't have even done it and that I wouldn't again. Today she told me that she needs to ""think"" about our relationship. By the way this is the second time she told me this and we have a tendency of breaking up every time we fight but get back together because we both don't mean it. Back to what she was saying though, she told me that she feels like she is changing me to suit her needs for a man that she should just want me for who I am. That she feels horrible for making ruin my relationship with my friend and a lot of other things like stopping me smoking hookah and weed. I told her that I care about her and I am happy to stop these things because being with her is what I want to do. I tell her that nobody is perfect no one is exactly what the other person wants but that in a relationship you should see the person as a whole and that you should love them for that. I also told her that if I am really not the right boyfriend for her even though I know I am an amazing boyfriend and do things that go beyond what a typical person would do. She has told me plenty of times that I am the best boyfriend she has ever had because no one has treated her the way I do. I just don't know what to do though. She does this to me and now I am just depressed not knowing what are relationship is like or where it is headed. I'm a faithful guy I never cheat and all I care about is a long term steady relationship.

Any advice on my current situation I seriously have no idea what to do. I love her and want to be with her, but I am tired of the fighting and arguing and I just want to be in a happy relaxed relationship.

1f5orl,4,2013-05-27,In response to Maguyton's post on the environment...[Long Read/Discussion],ScotchandClass,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1f5orl/in_response_to_maguytons_post_on_the/,"I wanted to post this in his thread but I figured my post would be too long as a response.  This is in response to your query on Christians responsibility with the environment and what we think.

I wrote this paper for my 'Book of Romans' class for an internship I'm in for my church in Seattle.  I hope it's somewhat clear.  

Would love to hear thoughts and opinions...before writing this I never gave much thought to the environment as a believer.  Cheers!


​Have you ever taken a walk outside during an exceptionally beautiful, sunny Seattle day?  Have you taken time to notice the beautiful green of the trees or the bright color of the many varieties of flowers that blossom in the spring?  Or have you ever driven over the 520 bridge towards Bellevue on a crisp, clear evening and been awed by the wonderful reds and oranges in the clouds during a sun set, while looking towards Mt. Ranier in all her glory?  Only recently have I personally taken note of the wonder of God’s creation.  As a kid, I traveled a lot; many times going back and forth across the country.  I have seen many amazing things, but I had taken for granted their intricacy and beauty.  
​Now as a young man, and one who has an established and loving relationship with the Lord, I am beginning to see His wisdom, genius, brilliance and even His love expressed in His creation.  David declares, “The earth is the LORD’s and all its fullness…” (Psalm 24:1 NKJV).  God crafted His planet Earth for His glory, that it would bring Him praise and honor.  This applies to humanity as well.  God’s original and coming purpose for man is to live perfected with Him in a perfect paradise.  But Adam’s sin postponed the fulfillment of this intention; however, God’s plan of redemption will ultimately bring the Earth and humanity back into His perfect will.  Our responsibility should reflect God’s original intention for us in the Earth.
​The Book of Genesis recounts man’s creation and his tasking, by God, to be stewards over the Earth.  In verse 27 of the first chapter, God, “created man in His own image; in the image of God he created him, male and female He created them.  Then God blessed them, and God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.’…”  This is man’s original purpose with relation to the Earth: steward it, lead it and rule it.
​When Adam and Eve sinned, God cursed the creation saying:
Cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life.  Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you…in the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; For dust you are, and to dust you shall return. Genesis 3:17-19
Mankind would no longer be allowed to enjoy the Earth but be forced to endure it because of his sin.  Solomon alludes to this in ‘Ecclesiastes’ when he says, “For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun?  For all his days are sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest.  This also is vanity.” (Ecclesiastes 2:22-23)  
​God’s plan of redemption through Jesus Christ is to bring us back into relationship with God and to ultimately have our corrupted, natural bodies redeemed, just as Christ’s resurrected body was redeemed.  As the Holy Spirit sanctifies us unto that day, with which Paul says that we hope for, the creation too looks forward to its redemption.  Paul, writing to the believers in Rome, says, “For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.  For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected in hope; because the creation itself will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.” (Romans 8:19-21 NKJV).  Our sin brought a curse and corruption over God’s creation here on Earth.
​Grace, through Jesus, has brought redemption to our souls and eventually will be consummated in the redemption of our bodies.  Likewise, redemption will be brought to the creation, even as it now looks forward to that day with the same hope that we have.  The Apostle John writes in his ‘Revelation’ on the island of Patmos, while exiled by the Roman Emperor Nero, “Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.  Also there was no more sea.” (Revelation 21:1) and God proclaims, “Behold, I make all things new.” (Revelation 21:5)  This new heaven and new earth, with the return of Jesus, ushers in a new era where man dwells with his God in paradise.  Thus, this is the fulfillment of God’s intended purpose for His creation.  
The prophet Isaiah describes the future glory of Zion, an image of heaven and paradise in the 35th chapter.  “The wilderness and the wasteland shall be glad for them, and the desert shall rejoince and blossom as the rose…the parched ground shall become a pool, abd the thirsty land springs of water; in the habitation of jackals, where each lay, there shall be grass with reeds and rushes.”  Finally, Isaiah forsees “But the redeemed shall walk there, and the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with singing, with everlasting joy on their heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” (Isaiah 35:1-2, 7, 10)  
​Our heart toward the Earth should reflect God’s and we should realize our intended purpose as rulers and stewards of it.  Humanity has been given this wonderful gift of Earth, with all of her trees, animals, mountains and seas as an inheritance and blessing.  He created it for us to enjoy and where we could worship and glorify Him.  Thus, we should do our best to be good stewards, not intentionally destroying and polluting it.  But rather doing, to the best our abilities, to preserve the environment and practice healthy habits for sustaining ourselves and the planet.  
​
We know that we have been saved by grace, that we have relationship with God and that in the future we will be completely restored to perfection, even as Paul says that we now, “beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 3:18)  We even know that God will redeem the Earth when he returns.  But in the same way we are encouraged to live our lives with wisdom and with Godliness, we should treat the Earth in the same way; instead of being negligent, knowing what God will perform in it, we should treat it with care.
​However, we must beware that we don’t put so much of our emphasis on the Earth instead of God.  Paul says in the beginning of epistle to the Romans, that those who sin and worship themselves, “exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator…” (Romans 1:25 NKJV)  The Apostle John writes that the elders who sit before God’s throne in heaven declare, “And that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and to those who fear Your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth.” (Revelation 11:18)
​We know what God will do in the future, but that does not give us free reign in continuing to harm the Earth intentionally.  We should be inclined, not given, to the Earth’s preservation as a means of worshiping and honoring God.  For this, is a part of His intended purpose for man, that we be rulers and stewards of His creation.

1f5nzc,7,2013-05-27,5 Things I Learned Today,perrett,running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1f5nzc/5_things_i_learned_today/,"5 Things I've learned so far this summer (mostly today):

**Nutrition**- I'm currently a senior in college. During the school year, I have an unlimited meal plan which means I can go into the dining hall and eat how ever much I want, whenever I want. This meant that I got to eat tons of meat and vegetables. For the past three weeks, I've been living in a new city for an internship. As such, I have had to cook my own food. My runs so far this summer had been slow and sloggish. I didn't understand why I wasn't able to keep my mileage and pacing consistent with the school year. After eating a larger amount of vegetables this weekend and going for a run today, it hit me: I hadn't been eating enough. Making sure you get nutritious meals is important and just as important is making sure those meals are large enough to maintain an active lifestyle.Today's run I felt more energized and was able to maintain my pace. 

Speaking of which,

**Pace**- I have a few points about pace. 

1. I mentioned that I was in a new city. The trail system here is fantastic, but I am inexperienced with them. My pace that I am used to during the school year has been on mostly flat trails with little incline. However, this city's trail system has hills and inclines that I was not used to. I realized that I cannot expect to use the same pacing that I am comfortable with and must adapt to the hills that I now face this summer. It only took three weeks of murdering my legs to realize this. 

2. I set out today to run three miles, but I ended up taking a wrong turn and getting lost. I found myself running through a golf course and neighborhood that added an additional five miles to my run. I recognized that my run was going to be significantly longer and adjusted my pace accordingly. Adapting your pace to what you are being faced with is important.

**Limits**- Since coming to this new city, I have not run a decently long distance until today. To be honest, with all of these hills I didn't know if I could do it. My mind was telling me, ""You're an idiot. Why are you doing this to yourself? These hills are going to crush you."" There is a quote by Robert Fritz, ""“If you limit your choices only to what seems possible or reasonable, you disconnect yourself from what you truly want, and all that is left is compromise.” I take that to heart. I pushed myself beyond what I ever thought was possible today. That is what I love about running.

**Being in the Moment**- During this adventure I had today, I shut out those thoughts of quitting and misery and focused on the run. What a run it was. The scenery surrounding me was gorgeous: the perfectly cut golf course grass, the families and friends playing in the parks and running on the trails, and the quarter mile strip through lavender trees. The views and smells were glorious. Appreciating these are just as important as logging those miles.

Those are some of the things I've learned today, and I hope you have come (or will come) to these as well."

1f5h46,1,2013-05-27,[23/m] Ex GF (20/f) wants to get back with me after breaking up with me through text a week prior.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1f5h46/23m_ex_gf_20f_wants_to_get_back_with_me_after/,"Long story: 

She has for a long time been very distant and unsure of things, and before this text she told me to my face that she was getting feelings for another guy and she felt like I should know. She hid this exact thing from me for 2 months when I asked her about it. Of course I was torn apart, but even more so because before this happened exactly a year ago I cheated on her. When this happened, I told her the day after. I was up for countless nights throwing up mainly because I was literally sick with myself and my behaviour. After that happened and I came clean, she decided to want to try things again and for 7 months I worked to earn her forgiveness. She forgave me finally, and things were great for a while until we started fighting and whatnot more frequently than usual, which brings us to now. She seemed to find what she wasn't getting from me from this other guy and played a balancing act until she couldn't take it. I told her the day everything came out about this that I was sorry for whatever I did to cause this and forgave her for what happened, however she had to help in the same regards as in being more vocal with her needs so I can adress them better. A week later after being even more distant (which I kind of expected from the events) she sent a text saying that she ""wasn't happy with me anymore and needed to separate from me."" This pushed me over the edge. I never wanted her to talk to me ever again after this. I was *really* hurt. 

So a week later she decides that she needed to talk to me again. She seemed genuinely upset about what she did and that she loved me and wanted to try things again, like start over. I wanted none of this; I felt so bitter that I told her exactly how I felt about how she played a balancing game between me and this other guy and how she lied about going practice piano when she was actually seeing this other guy. She claims she never kissed him or let anything happen, but the fact that she cancelled plans with family and things like that gave me the effect that I wasn't on the top of her priority list. We hung up the phone after a grueling 2 hours of tear filled talking and pleading. Fast forward an hour later, she drove all the way from her hometown to meet me face to face and try to reconsider my ultimatum of ending things. I have 
*never* seen her so torn up about something. It was uncomfortable, and part of me wanted to believe it was genuine and worth it, but I couldn't convince myself that I did. I told her that things weren't as great as she believed they used to be, and she respectfully disagreed and told me that she loved me and she was willing to work things through. I told her at the end of the night that if she really wanted me back and if there was an inkling of me even wanting to get back together, she'd give me space until I decided. She wanted to know after I got back from an internship, which would be the end of July.

**tl;dr:** girlfriend broke up with me through a text, week later came back asking to be back together, tried to convince her things weren't as pretty, she refuses and wants to try things again

This is where you guys come in. I have so many doubts about things having to do between us, and my family thinks I'm better off, but I really have no clue. In search of free internet advice, is it worth trying things again? Am I right for feeling the way I do? Can I trust her again? 

**edit:** sorry for the wall of text."
1f5g6h,0,2013-05-27,Advice for a 1 year old cat that just moved into house with my parents (and for the summer without me)?,[deleted],Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1f5g6h/advice_for_a_1_year_old_cat_that_just_moved_into/,"Obviously this can be wildly different depending on the animal, but any basic suggestions would be welcome.

I got a kitten 1 year ago as a baby (5 weeks old), and raised her during my final year of college. Now I am back home and in 1 week leave for an internship in Utah, where I sadly cannot bring her (Rules in the place I have to stay explicitly forbid pets).

So my parents are taking care of her for 3 months, before I return to take care of her again.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to ease this transition for her, and how to make it easy for my parents as well? She is slowly but cautiously adjusting to the new house, but does not seem to be taking much of a liking to my parents.

The cat is well-behaved in that she has never angrily attacked anyone, but she has hissed and (lightly) scratched at my parents before. I obviously wish to do what I can (or tell my parents what they might be able to do) to keep relations as amiable as possible.

My best idea was simply have them feed her, occasionally play with her using string or other toys... and hope for the best. But I figure someone might have other useful ideas.

I know these typical ""what are my chances"" threads get somewhat old to most, but they are genuinely very helpful to the OP's.

I'm a rising senior at a top 30 university (UNC- Chapel Hill) with a current 3.57 cumulative GPA (science is about the same, I'm not exactly sure what counts) but it is rising. 

I'm a Psychology BS and an Exercise and Sport Science double major. I picked these two areas of study because I wanted to get a holistic understanding of human health. Our biology program is geared towards students seeking to go to graduate school, whereas EXSS is biology strictly applied to the human body. In my majors, I have almost a 4.0 GPA.

My grades biology and physics have been fine. Majority A/A- for Bio classes, B+ in Calc-based Mechanics and A in Calc-based electricity and magnetism. However, my chemistry grades are not where I'd want them to be at all. Predominantly B+'s in gen chem 1, 2 and orgo 1; C+ in Analytical and Orgo 2. For the latter, I took it over the summer working full time (35+ hours a week) and taking another summer class, in which I got an A. To show that this isn't typical of me, I took an upper level biochem class and got an A-. However, these C's are quite a blow to my confidence.

I'm paying for my education completely by myself, which has likely interfered with my academic performances and my ability to pursue many opportunities that I wish I had been able to pursue. I've been financially independent since 18.

Virtually everything I start to get involved in has ended due to extenuating circumstances out of my control. For my work-study position, I was a research assistant for about a year and a half. The PI likes to have his students help with experiments and do some of their own after working for a year, but for the entire past semester, they have been preparing to move to another university. Another internship I had with a Psychiatric EEG Infant lab only lasted a semester due to budget cuts. My sophomore year I got EMT-B certified and was asked to return to be a student mentor on the path to paid instructor, but the community college cut the class the next semester. I haven't been able to work as an EMT because I don't have a drivers license, since I can't afford a car.

Since my work-study job is ending, I found a new one to be a medical resident's assistant in the local hospital, which will allow me to work and shadow at the same time.

I will be graduating with a Public Service Scholar recognition on my transcript, which requires volunteering for 300 hours in Undergrad. 100+ of which will have come from volunteering in the Emergency Room in the local hospital.

I have not taken the MCAT yet.

I am very involved in the department of Housing here, having been an RA for a year and will be again next year. I feel as if there are many transferable skills from being an RA to being a physician, such as confidence, communication skills, crisis management and customer service.

However I sit here and read the amazing things that other people do here on this subreddit, but who also have wavering confidence. Things like being included on research papers, doing honors theses, exceptionally high MCAT and GPA, references upon references. I just feel like I'm not cut out, after all these years of working towards it.

[What are some of the worst/weirdest situations you were involved in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u4gn?context=5)|I have had people working at the Ministry of Education ask me for bribes. I have seen ministers embezzle funds. My life has been threatened twice. The first organisation I had worked with had asked me to allocate certain funds designated to the purchase of ringers lactate (necessary for cholera treatment) to a supplier that was across the globe instead of in the US because the transportation costs would have been higher and we could say more money was spent that way.
 |The weirdest situation I ever found myself was probably when being invited to a meeting at a restaurant at night. The restaurant was bursting with music, imported steaks, tons of alcohol. Meanwhile, across the street from the restaurant was an IDP camp. This was during cholera too, so as you left the restaurant you could actually hear the moans of people who were being treated at the cholera treatment centre nearby. It was surreal.
[ of all, thank you for your work. You have clearly affected many lives in a positive way. How has it affected your life being down there for so long and witnessing so many things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6ufql?context=5)|Thank you for your kind remarks.
 |It is depressing work. For a long time I would drink myself to sleep. For a month or two I was punching the wall next to my bed in my sleep as well. It is crazy, I think many people see those who are in my line of work not as human beings. There are always negative comments about how aid workers whore, drink, and do drugs. How they have loud parties while people are starving/dying/suffering and how they go on wonderful holidays and generally seem to be having a good time. I would have to say that we are all human beings. Doing some of these things is in some cases the only way to cope. One cannot be in constant despair, and in fact, that is exactly one of the reasons we choose to do this work, to get people out of constant despair. We cannot do good work if we are constantly thinking of horror. So what happens? We become desensitised, we drink a lot, we smoke a lot, we may become belligerent, whatever.
 |With me, I lost my girlfriend after a few months of being here. I had trouble following conversations. I could not sleep unless I had a drink in me. I hated this place for a long time, and maybe I still do. But things are better with me now. In part I have gotten used to it (desensitised it enough), and in part I have changed my surroundings.
 |I do, however, think that seeing a therapist after I leave here will probably do me a world of good.
[I understand the whole avoiding despair, but as someone that has had many friends in deployed locations, there's more you can do just coping with one another than drink, smoke, and party. I am afraid to visit most other countries because of the bad reputation people have given of english-speaking people. Do we need to send out a humanitarian effort for the humanitarian effort now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v5ut?context=5)|Hahaha,
 |That's a funny thought. I agree there are other ways to cope. Drink, smoke and party are usually cheaper, easier, and less time-consuming. 
[What's your perspective on the long-term aid work going on there? Lots of teams went down short-term, but it's interesting that you stayed. How, if at all, has your perspective pertaining to Haiti's needs changed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u2wj?context=5)|There were tons of organisations coming in in 2010. At one point the Ministry of Interior was saying that about 4000 different organisations (NGOs, church groups, international businesses, etc.) were working in the country. The immediate response was therefore very hectic. There was very little organisation. The UN held (and still holds) what they called ""cluster meetings"". These thematic meetings tried to coordinate the various activities of all the different actors (so there'd be an education cluster, a shelter cluster, a WASH cluster, etc). Unfortunately many of the smaller NGOs would not participate, making true coordination efforts impossible. You would have large NGOs such as Samaritan's Purse or Save the Children trying to build schools with the coordination and ""assistance"" of the Ministry of Education, but then some church group from Kansas would come in and would build a school in the areas where the large organisations were meaning to work, thus ruining projects that would probably have had a larger impact and would be managed better.
 |Tons of money was thrown away in this way. There was also lots of corruption and profiteering. Port-au-Prince, for example, became one of the most expensive cities in the world. Materials for construction, medication, essentially anything that was needed to carry out projects was so expensive that the money allocated for certain activities was barely enough to achieve what had initially been planned out. The opposite thing would also happen, some organisations were unlucky enough to receive far more money than they could spend, and so tried to get rid of it in any way they could, consciously making bad investments, making little effort to protect their warehouses and doing anything when things were stolen, thus forcing them to spend more money buying the material that was stolen. That sort of thing.
 |There are all sorts of beautiful, wonderful strategies for development in Haiti. They have been drafted using money from all sorts of organisations and countries and they make for nice meeting platforms. They are essentially useless, though. Very little effort has been taken to make coordinated moves towards developments. Most of the action from government, NGOs, UN, and the other different actors has been uncoordinated and disorderly. You can think of it as a school children. They will all acts as ""friends"" make wonderful plans to work together, publish amazing reports with distorted figures about the achievements that have been done, while at the same time stabbing each other's backs and wanting to take as much credit as possible for the small positive outcomes. Thus the government claims that the building of 200 new schools in 6 months was their achievement, the UN will say that these same 200 schools could not have been built without the aid of the MINUSTAH (Mission des Nations Unis pour la Stabilisation d'Haiti - peacekeepers), the European Union will say that they put in the money and have therefore contributed to Haiti's education, and meanwhile there are no desks or chairs at the school or, as I've seen it, the owners of the land where the school has been built have decided to make some changes to the building and turn it into a private residence.
 |The chaos was evident since I arrived, but I had hope that it would get better. It seemed for a while that true coordination efforts were under way to actually come up with a central plan to develop Haiti. In fact, I believe the government had even created an organisation to do this. With time, though, especially around election time in 2010 (November, December and then again in beginning of 2011), we all lost focus. The chaos became the status quo, it was accepted, this is Haiti, there was really nothing that could be done about it. Apathy in one person or in a group of people happens all the time and is easily overcome, but apathy in a government and all its supporting branches and external structures is really a depressing thing that is almost impossible to overcome.
 |I am not sure if that answered your question, but there you have it.
[So, would you say that the Haitians would actually be better off if they were left to their own devices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6ulv1?context=5)|That is an extreme viewpoint. I do not believe that Haitians would be better off alone. Besides some interventions and invasions, Haitians have been alone since their independence. It is a country with an extensive history of abuse of power, factionalism and stupendous brinkmanship. I believe that the earthquake of 2010 was a fantastic opportunity for Haiti to take advantage of the aid, the global support and sympathy it had, and to move forward. Part of my disappointment with this issue comes from how quickly all of this was forgotten here. I believe that if Haiti is to develop, it should come from within Haiti, yes, but this will not be possible without the financial aid of the international community. The mechanism through which the aid is sent to Haiti should be changed, though. Maybe this is a bit of a hazy answer...
[1 What lessons have you learned about organizing short-term, first on the scene response team strategies &amp; execution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uqbf?context=5)|I am not entirely sure if it is actually possible to do coordinated first responses. The nature of the emergency itself means that there will be little organisation and a lot of disorder, however I do believe that smaller organisations (even a group of missionaries coming in for a week) should do their homework and ask themselves if the activities they plan to do are in harmony with what is already being done. They should ask themselves if there is anyone else working in the area, if their practices will create inequality or dependency, etc. The Sphere Standards are a good start.
[2 Long-term development strategies seem to be lacking vision, yet have some resources to accomplish something. What do you see as the future for Haiti? Will they rebuild back to its previously decrepit, poverty - stricken standard, or will they rebuild into something greater? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uqbf?context=5)|I believe it is important for governments to make emergency plans for the sorts of emergencies they are prone to. Haiti did not have an earthquake plan, unfortunately.  Haiti is currently looking into improving its tourism industry. It is laughable to some, but a very daring feat. I believe that the future of Haiti does lie in the service industry. Manufacturing, mining, tourism, etc.  The poverty-stricken standard is what is currently in place at the moment. I believe that this is the accepted status quo. It is not accepted by those outside of Port-au-Prince, of course, but it is accepted by the political elite, the business owners, even, I dare say, some NGOs who wouldn't exist if it wasn't for this standard.
[The ""Haitian people"" would not be left to their own devices anyway, someone like Papa Doc would probably grab power.  Anarchy is unstable.  (Right?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vicn?context=5)|But that's what I mean as being left to their own devices. Maybe I don't understand your comment. Someone like papa doc or aristide or baby doc is exactly what has happened when they have been left to their own devices.
[Hey I am Tourism student, studying in UK. Next year I will be required to take a placement in industry as part of degree, I was looking into internship work in Africa's Nature Reserves. But after checking your AMA, I'm interested about possibilities in Haiti. After some googling i found most of the issues with it, but wanted to hear your opinion on tourism in Haiti, its expansion. Also do you think there are any opportunities for internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6wxqs?context=5)|You could try and contact some of the hotels directly to see if they'd be willing to take you on. My main problem with tourism in Haiti is that Haiti does not sound, in my opinion, like an ideal Caribbean holiday. I find it difficult to think of a tourist who would want to come here for a month or two in the summer. Also, I believe the Dominican Republic is the biggest tourist destination in the Caribbean. It will be difficult to compete with such a large business. In spite of this, there ARE tourists who come here, and the Ministry of Tourism is doing a hell of a lot to try and help. I have not studied tourism so my views are completely superficial, but who knows, maybe there is a future in tourism here. You might also want to try contacting the Ministry of Tourism directly, it wouldn't hurt, at the very least they could forward you on to someone who could help you. Good luck!
[Could you elaborate a bit more about the waste of money happening in Haiti?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uyjn?context=5)|Could you elaborate a bit more about the waste of money happening in Haiti?
[What do you think happened with the bulk of aid money that was committed to Haiti in 2010 immediately following the earthquake?  Why do you think it is so hard for Haiti to recover from the earthquake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uyjn?context=5)|What do you think happened with the bulk of aid money that was committed to Haiti in 2010 immediately following the earthquake? -This is hard to say. Most of the answers above cover this quite well with the addition that in 2010 most of the activities were for emergency response, therefore short-term goals (distribution water or food) and therefore have not left a tangible mark that can be seen today.  Why do you think it is so hard for Haiti to recover from the earthquake? - The earthquake destroyed Port-au-Prince, the largest city and commercial base of the country. It's as if New York City were suddenly obliterated. Recovery from something like that would be slow and painful. If on top of that you take into account lack of coordination, corruption, and personal interests then you will end up with something like Haiti today.
[How do you feel about the current government in Haiti?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uyjn?context=5)|How do you feel about the current government in Haiti?
[Why did you choose to go to Haiti? How long do you plan on staying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u0r0?context=5)|I chose to go to Haiti because I needed work. I got an interview through a friend of mine for an NGO and was sent over very shortly after the earthquake of 2010 (in January). I did it because at the time it was the highest paying job I could find, and because it was vaguely related to what I wanted to do career-wise. I never intended to stay as long as I have. One month turned into three more, which turned into six, and next thing I know I've been here for years. For a while I tried convincing myself that I came to help people and to respond to the disaster, and I suppose that made my job easier, but with time I realised that it is really a dirty and disgusting business (yes, a business). I plan to leave in December of this year.
[Do you know the best way to become involved in NGOs? I have wanted to volunteer for a very long time now but since it seems that whenever I try to ask about volunteering or working I am given the same response, no. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vwyd?context=5)|Yes,
 |Try contacting NGOs in usually uninteresting countries at first. I made the suggestion to someone else of Samaritan's Purse in Bolivia (again, I don't work for samaritan's purse and don't know if they actually work in Bolivia). If you write directly to the country director (whose name you could probably find by googling it) you will have higher chances of getting a positive response. 
[Will you work in a similar capacity elsewhere? I assume this kind of work looks good in general, right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6y262?context=5)|I am thinking about possibly continuing work in Asia, but at the moment am in a bit of an existential limbo. Who knows!
[*I did it because at the time it was the highest paying job I could find.*  Nosy question, but how much does it pay?  Edit: If you ignore this, I don't blame you at all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6yqus?context=5)|I answered this somewhere else. The first job I had here paid around USD$4,500.00 a month including housing and transportation with R&amp;R every two months (plane ticket was included for the RR)
[What's the best way to donate to Haiti relief? I hear that so little of the donated money actually reaches the island, it sounds like it would be more effective to just put cash in an envelope and mail it to a random name in the Haiti white pages.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v0je?context=5)|Let me tell you first what the worst way to donate is: donations in kind. Sending clothes, water, food, whatever. That is amazingly annoying and mostly unnecessary. Most of the donations in kind will sit at warehouses for weeks and months and will cost much more to store and transport than if it was bought separately.
 |The easiest way to donate to Haiti would be to give money to a reputable, maybe non-religious organisation. It is true that a lot of the money does not reach the projects themselves, but that is unavoidable. You have to see your money not as equalling a brick in a school, but as something that helps that brick being put there. NGO offices, the cost of guards, even having coffee for a meeting, these all come from donations (mostly) and are in some way necessary to making it possible to put a brick in a school. Still, I understand your frustration with this.
[What do you think of this Earthship project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6x343?context=5)|I'd never heard of it before. I'll take a look at the video later. Thanks for the link!
[On to the question.  If you could change one thing in Haiti (politically, culturally, etc\) to aid in its advancement, what would it be?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uonk?context=5)|If I could change one thing in Haiti it would be the attitude of the beneficiaries. Over the past two years there has been a great and partly justified anti-NGO sentiment. They are suspicious of works being done and believe that we are just a business (which I believe we are in part). This obviously cuases massive problems with the work we are trying to achieve. Ironically this anti-NGO movement demands that we do more work and take over some of the activities that are the legal responsibilites of the state. So basically, they don't trust us, but they want us to do more.
[Why should anyone care about Haiti anymore? We provided money and support since the quake, and after the major coup d'etat, and after their last national disaster. Why shouldn't I just say, ""13 strikes and you're out?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6w6zd?context=5)|I'm not here to change your opinion. I think those are excellent questions and they have crossed my mind more than once as well.
[What is a humanitarian worker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6u3k3?context=5)|This is a great question. It's funny, I don't actually know what is probably a generally accepted definition of this. Maybe I should explain to you what I have done?
 |In 2010 I came in as part of an emergency team, trying to deal with fast response to the earthquake emergency. This meant the immediate alleviation of the needs of those affected. Thus, distribution of food and water, clothes, medication, emergency medical services, tents and tarpaulin for shelter, etc.
 |Since then I have moved to development. This means that the emergency is over and now we are focusing on long-term goals. So we have built schools, fixed roads, built hospitals, trained nurses, etc.
[I study International Development at Uni and this is pretty much what I want to spend my life doing. How'd you get into it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6whp4?context=5)|I'm sorry for this short answer, if you look around there are a couple of other people who asked the same question. My answers are there.
[P.S. how's your Creole?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6utu3?context=5)| 
[I was just in Port au Prince! I got back on Tuesday from a ten day trip there. My father works in a high position for Digicel down there, I'd rather not say what exactly. I met some girls at Wahoo Bay that were working for Hope for Haiti, so this post piqued my curiosity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vpzh?context=5)|I think in part it's just the way it is. They're used to it. I'm used to it too at this point. Secondly, there are very few pick-up spots for refuse. Thirdly, many people choose to throw it in the canals because it is easier than burning it themselves.
[My question to you is when I was down there, the amount of trash on the mountain sides, in the street, etc. was astonishing to me. Coming from the states, it was shocking to me that there was no regard for cleanup as we have here. Why do you think that is? Do you think that the Haitians don't care, or is there more to it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vpzh?context=5)|Every once in a while there will be efforts to clean up, but because of how Port-au-Prince is built, rain tends to wash a lot of it up on the streets.
[How much is the pay? and are many of the prisoners that escaped still out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6w1s9?context=5)|For project management positions it is anywhere between EUR 1000.00 and EUR 6000.00 a month depending on the organisation. In the first organisation I worked with my boss, the country director was making around USD 120,000.00 a year. It really depends on the size of the organisation.
[What would you say to someone to convince him/her to become a humanitarian worker in Haiti like you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uzzc?context=5)|I'm not sure I would try to convince anyone to do this. It is hard, it is uncomfortable, and it will eventually break you. I believe it was more difficult for me because it wasn't an actual calling. I did it for convenience, and though at the beginning I did believe that I was doing good work and that I wanted to help, this faded. It is sad. Had I had other opitons, I think I would have left much earlier. This makes me incredibly sad about myself, but it is true. If you want to do aid work, you should know it and be sure of it without asking other's opinions, I think. Think of it like joining a seminary.
[Say I wanted to leave for this type of work immediately. How does one jump right in? I've been wanting to do some kind of work like this temporarily, and eventually permanently. Are you actually a volunteer and have to pay for all travel, food, and living expenses or are you a paid contractor of some type?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v0ac?context=5)|Strangely, it is harder than one would expect. I got lucky. Organisations are usually looking for educated individuals, and usually people educated in either the field of humanitarian affairs or whatever specific field they will be working in (e.g. WASH - Water, Sanitation and Hygiene experts).
 |Some organisations might look for volunteers but they are also very competitive. Take a look at reliefweb.com . Job descriptions there might give you an idea of what it is they're looking for.
[Do they need people with IT skills?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6y9bu?context=5)|Yes. People with IT skills are always needed. As in any office or work environment, things will crash and people need, no, DEMAND someone to blame.
[A close friend of mine was working for some private security firm over there. She said there was a big problem with the Haitians raping women over there. Apparently she wasn't allowed to go out after dark for fear of people raping her. At some point a group of people got fed up with all the women being raped, rounded up a group of like, 12 people who had tried to rape their female counter-parts, and murdered them all on the roof of a building. Is rape a serious problem over there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6wkes?context=5)|Rape is a massive problem. I remember reading that rape did not actually become illegal until the beginning of this century, though I'm not sure if that's true. I receive a daily digest of security issues in Port-au-Prince from the UN and I'd say about 80% of these are related to rapes. Also, vigilantism is massive. Lots of lynchings.
[If you had to do it over, would you have gone and done this? Whats the biggest problem with Haiti / the people ? That country seems to not be able to lift itself out of poverty vs dominican republic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6wjd8?context=5)|If I had to do it over again I don't think I would have stayed longer than a year.
 |In a nutshell the Dominican Republic has the advantage that it speaks Spanish and can therefore form active part of its surrounding community, it has made an active effort to improve its political culture since its dictatorship, and it was able to take advantage of the tourist industry starting from the 1970s. Haiti at one point was a bigger tourism destination than the Dominican Republic (in the 70s I believe). Since then political problems have, in my opinion, managed to detract from this sort of development.
[Can any real change be taken in Haiti while the government is corrupt? A government needs to provide for it's people, and clearly the Haitian government does not do that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6uyw4?context=5)|I do not believe positive significant change can take place with a corrupt government.
[How do you feel choosing this path, and how have the people there taught you as a person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6w4fr?context=5)|I feel emotionally and physically exhausted. From the people here I have learnt what true human resilience is. I have also learnt what despair and distrust truly is. I have been incredibly angry at the people here, I have hated all of it, but I have also realised that classifying a people as one entity, giving them one label and one name, is an exercise in futility. You will find all sorts of kind people and all sorts of spiteful people, and though it sounds very trite, you might as well focus on the good ones because the others will have you wallowing in despair.
[Serious question: What do you think are the reason(s\) that Haiti is still in a mess, compared to other countries or societies which had comparable or greater earthquakes?  I'm working on a related economics research, and would like to hear an at-the-field, outside-of-discipline opinion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6w9z2?context=5)|Predominantly the political culture. It is based on factionalism, corruption and strong-arming. A crude simile would be the mafia. Strong structures with dubious populist bases who are able to control through fear, pressure, and the sheer weight of money being thrown around.

Schools have been built, cholera has been responded to in an amazing way, local associations have been set up and are able to effectively manage and represent their communities. I believe that achievements have been made but nothing near what was expected, and this isn't from lack of trying. I think that expectations were far too high and unrealistic.
[How did you come to the realization that you wanted to do development work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vnx0?context=5)|Hello!
[How did you find this position/opportunity to work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vnx0?context=5)|I studied something vaguely related to this sort of work, and was lucky enough to be able to get an interview in January of 2010. You might say I fell into it.
[Do you know specifically of any reputable NGO's looking for employees or volunteers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vnx0?context=5)|I'm not too sure about volunteers, but if you are interested in coming to Haiti you could take a look at either reliefweb or devex. That should give you a quick overview.
[Do you think that some of the work that is being done allows the Haitian government to get away with irresponsible spending?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6v8pr?context=5)|Definitely. A common strategy is to request salarial aid for extra work such-and-such functionary will need to do in order to move this proposal/project/importation/whatever along.
 |That is small, though.
 |The big ones are when donors give money directly to the government for projects.

Lots of money, lots of questionable expenses. If you're talking about a large infrastructure project, then even better. You will need government approvals, licenses, maybe even businesses that are owned by functionaries.

If you want to do microcredits, do some economics, try to get an internship with a local microcredit organisation (you can even find them in large US cities!), if you want to do WASH then do an internship as a plumber's assistant (seriously!). Development alone won't get you very far.

For example, look up the Samaritan's Purse office in Bolivia (that's just an example, I have no connection to Samaritan's Purse, I don't even know if they work there) and simply write and say that you'd be interested in doing an internship. You'll be more likely to get one that way than by going through the usual competitive routes.

But then I realise I've gotten used to not walking around in Port-au-Prince, gotten used to having armed guards at the door of my house, knowing exit routes BY HEART. Some friends of mine have been robbed, one them was almost kidnapped (his colleagues were kidnapped, he was out of the house at the time). There was a Swiss woman who was killed for HTG2,000.00 in Cap Haitien I believe. It can be dangerous.
[How many places have you been to help out in Haiti?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca6vo2s?context=5)|I worked predominantly in Port-au-Prince but have been working throughout the country except for the Sud and Grand-Anse departments.
[I don't know if this will get seen, but will give it a shot. My parents are Canadian, but I grew up in Haiti. They moved there to help out in the 80s but not as part of any NGO or company, just on their own. When my mom first moved there she lived in a tiny little room rented from a house with no furniture and barely enough to live on. My parents were very determined that I grow up as a Haitian culturally, I went to Haitian schools (most ex-pats would go to Americanized schools\) I spent time in my neighbourhood with the kids there, not going to special ex-pat hangout spots or summer camps. I am culturally a Haitian and associate with Haiti more than any other culture. My mother has worked since with many aid organizations and now runs her own small scale, grass-roots, Haitian NGO focused on teacher training. I've seen everything there is to see with NGO's and their workers. From this perspective I've felt it's a shame that aid workers and ex-pats don't get enough exposure to Haitians. They see the worst because they interact with people who are in dire situations or deal with corrupt officials. Whereas there is so much joy and beauty there, and growing up there I don't have any familiarity with most of the situations OP has talked about (not that he's been bad mouthing Haiti or that these things don't exist, just that there's a dark side in any country, I'm sure aid/social workers in the US/Canada might have many similar stories, though probably not as publicly visible as in Haiti\). So a question to OP is, do you think it would be beneficial to be more exposed to Haitian community life? Would it help with the depression and shock that many of you feel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca703a3?context=5)|Yes. I think that more exposure would help with depression and so on. I'm not sure if it would have helped much in 2010 when things were so out of control, but it would certainly help now. And let me say, there are many expats who have given themselves to Haiti completely. They have made families here, have become completely entwined with the country. Many of those who left have very fond memories of Haiti.
[TL;DR; Grew up in Haiti as Haitian, parents involved in NGOs. I feel it would benefit NGO workers to be more involved in Haitian life, than just helping in the emergencies. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f4xlx/i_am_a_humanitarian_worker_who_has_been_in_haiti/ca703a3?context=5)|It was never my intention to bad-mouth the country, and I'm sorry if it might have even seemed that way. I am only one voice and one opinion, and I only mean to share what I have seen and felt.

Cloud computing seems perfect for me because I love Infrastructure/Operating Systems while preferring a higher level language like Python. I do not have too much experience working with large codebases and I have little to no experience contributing to an open source project. Do you think it's a little over-ambitious as a first project? Should I focus on something easier? And if I do decide on OpenStack, where exactly do I start? There seems to be a sea of documentation that leaves me confused.

Recently when I was applying for an internship I decided to show off what little I know about HTML CSS Javascript by creating a simple website about myself and sending that with my application email. The internship was for a manufacturing company but they said they were impressed by my resume. 

Previously this year my mom, a graphic designer, was whining about how low quality the website that their company's website guy had made. I didn't know much about the big 3 web languages (and still don't) but my brother said it was something he said he could easily make.

Reflecting on these two events, I wonder if it's possible to get a job in web development without a degree. Somebody who probably did have a degree can get a job by making a crummy site, so could somebody like me have no degree but still be able to make a decent, functional site actually have a shot getting a job in this industry?

I haven't applied anywhere and I don't want to have a career in just web dev, I'm just curious (because we high schoolers like summer jobs and getting money).

tl;dr - Guy who probably has degree makes a site for a job that is about as high quality as a site a high schooler can make. From this, could somebody with no official web dev degree still get a job?

So I was looking for another way to release my creative energy without having the pressure of a job. 

Bought a Lumix G2 from Panasonic in 2011, but realized after a while that it limited me in my work. You couldn't even focus manually. Sold it. Bought a EOS Rebel T1i (500D in Europe) 2012, loved it, got a couple of lenses and started loving photography even more. 

A couple of month ago I fulfilled my long time dream and bought a Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm 1.4 lens with my first salaries. 

What really made photography my true passion was the idea of a ""365 day - 365 photos"" project. Photography has been a crucial part of my life for the last 143 days. Although a lot of people told me how freakin hard a 365 days is, it is one of the best things I ever did. It really showed me that you should do what you love everyday, even when it's just a couple of minutes. And to be honest, it's not like ""damn, I gotta take a photo today"". It's rather ""Fuck yeah, I'm gonna shoot something awesome today"".

1f4s6x,1,2013-05-27,Today at work,[deleted],TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/1f4s6x/today_at_work/,"So I don't usually work weekdays, but the pharmacist in charge asked me to fill in and tech today since we were short, and I needed the extra money.  I felt like coming on here and posting some stories from the day.  

First up I took in a prescription for Actonel for an older lady.  She handed me the Medicare/DVA copy of her (already dispensed, because it had a PBS sticker on it) script, with nothing attached, and asked 'Can I still use this?' 

*I'm posting from Australia - Aussie prescriptions always have a duplicate copy, which is attached to all repeats and is kept by the pharmacy after the person gets their final repeat filled, as well as a Medicare/DVA copy, which is the one that goes to government insurance (i.e. Medicare) with the PBS sticker attached to it after dispensing so that the pharmacy gets paid.  You need to have both copies otherwise the pharmacy can't dispense the script.*

I politely explained to the lady that the person who gave her out the script last time must have made a mistake to have given this back to her, as we needed to keep it to send to the government to get paid for the Actonel, and took instead the proper prescription with both copies that she (fortunately) had on her.  She then said to me, as I was writing out a ticket for her to pick up her script, 'Usually I only want to get one or two medications at a time, and when I pick up my scripts from here all the paper gets stapled together.  I wish they wouldn't do that.  I have to pull them apart and bring them in.  I've got so many loose pieces of paper like this at home.'

I wasn't really sure what to say at this point.  We have a lot of customers that take a lot of meds and only want certain ones filled - most pharmacies do staple all the repeats together for customers like this so nothing gets lost, and the customer usually just tells us what they want filled at the dropoff and we write it down.  I couldn't understand why she would think she needed to pull the paper apart.  
The pharmacist came over at this point to talk to her about bringing in the DVA copies with the stickers on them, so that we could get paid for dispensing her meds, and I went away to serve another customer.  Later I found out that the lady's husband had called in and said that he had dropped off the stickered copies to the competitor pharmacy across the road.  None of us had any clue why he would have done this - the pharmacist called the competitor and was told that the couple hadn't filled there for a couple of years.  So it looks like we aren't getting any money back for that Actonel - I hope she wasn't on anything else expensive.  

Anyway...

The next thing that happened today was much more standard fare.  A lady who spoke very little English informed us that she wanted three refills on each of her meds and that she wanted specific brands.  We ended up having to borrow a box of her simvastatin brand from the other pharmacy in our chain nearby because we didn't have enough.  All up there were 12 prescriptions that I needed to dispense and the pharmacist needed to check.  She decided to wait for them (of course) and the whole time she was there, asked every single staff member in the dispensary multiple times if it was ready yet.  The intern pharmacist was about ready to strangle her.  We were all very relieved when she paid for her meds and left the store.  

The retail manager is continuing to display blatant favouritism.  From the two years I have been working there, it's been common knowledge that those put on as supervisors with the ability to do refunds and count cash and such are very strongly preferred to be over eighteen due to the fact that they're often handling a lot of money.  The weekday floor supervisor that's been put on recently is sixteen.  She's also the retail manager's granddaughter.  The retail manager has this habit of playing favourites even with people who aren't her family members.  Her current one, a girl who is rude and condescending to the other staff but bends over backwards to fawn over the retail manager and the store owner, doesn't get given any cleaning jobs to do on the weekend, while the other girls had to do double the work.  Ugh.  

Anyway...that was my day at work today.  Just moderately crappy.  I would kind of like to read about other people's workdays in the comments (assuming I get any) but that's just me.  TL;DR: I was having a bit of a bitch about my job.  "

Thanks in advance for the consideration.

I had a fairly normal childhood. One older brother, parents divorced when I was 8. I was nerdy growing up and never really fit in. I got teased a bit, but nothing too serious. I never really had any interests, hobbies, or the like and even until today my mother always questioned/s ""Why don't you do __ like the other boys?"" ""Oh honey, normal boys don't like that stuff."" ..and the like. Both my parents always meant well and I was fortunate to be raised in a fairly affluent area and be well-traveled around the US. I was really studious, got good grades, steered way clear of trouble and did everything 'right'. Because I never really had a group of friends until senior year of high school, and because I was never really close to my family, I opted to go to college clear across to the other side of the country. I saw this as an opportunity to get a fresh start and to find my way.

Freshman year of college ('10 - '11) was great. I made an awesome group of friends, I earned good grades, and I landed an internship for the summer. In October 2010 I had the confidence to come out to one of my high school friends via snail mail. I slowly came out to other friends (college friends in January 2011) and could not ask for a better reaction - everyone has absolutely no problem with it and has treated me no differently.

I'd say I've felt depressed for as long as I can remember, but to put a fixed time on it I could definitively say 7th grade ('04 - '05). Last year ('11 - '12) is when my depression became so overwhelming that daily activities were exhausting. I talked with my roommate about it in the fall. He was understanding, as he had also dealt with depression. I was suicidal then, too. I recognized I needed help and turned to friends for support. I told them my entire background so they knew where I was coming from, and made them aware that I was depressed and suicidal. I did this individually with 5 or 6. At my most dramatic moments, I wrote out 3 page long bulletins that I mass-emailed to a dozen or so outlining my depression and asking for them to be understanding and supportive.

I think turning to my friends made the depression even worse. Instead of being able to talk to them about it, I found that it was (and still is) difficult to articulate my feelings. I'd feel like they wanted to hear and help, but then when I tried sitting down with them and explaining things that they were dismissive or disinterested in helping. My roommate referred me to his mental health counselor here at school, saying that she really helped him. I went to her two or three times and after taking the PHQ-9 was diagnosed with severe depression, as well as moderate anxiety. I tried antidepressants for a month or so and went to counseling two or three times but neither felt right, or like they were helping so I stopped both. I had 4 or 5 instances where I've been really intoxicated with alcohol and sent to the hospital, with friends present. Most of those times I was also suicidal so I was on watch during the night at the hospital. All of this was ongoing from October 2011 - August 2012. I tried to keep a happy front, but even with my depression in full-blown view in front of them, my friends never asked or seemed to genuinely care about my wellbeing.

I traveled for a bit and studied abroad from August - December 2012. Travel has always been my one and only true interest in life. I used all my savings and nearly wiped out my account to make this possible, and to try my best to reinvigorate myself. Perhaps I was overly optimistic, but I thought that after coming back I would feel refreshed, be able to get a full-time job for after graduation, and maybe even date.

Since returning from study abroad, my depression is not as bad as it was a year ago, but I'm afraid it's slowly creeping back to that point. I've submitted over 200 applications and interviewed more than 3 dozen times, with no job offers. Fortunately, I did earn an internship for this summer with plans for it to transition to full-time. The work is just okay in terms of where I'd like to be, but the pay is abyssmal - lower than what I made at my first internship. I tried a dating site or two (and more than once), and I went on dates with a dozen or so guys. Either I wasn't interested in them, or they weren't interested in me, so I've given up on dating. I've had more hookups than I'd like to share (this was after trying to find dates.)

At this point, I'm just trying to do all I can to keep from reverting back to how bad my depression was before. I really don't feel like I'll ever be 'not depressed' though. From most people's point of view my life should look great so I feel guilty feeling depressed. I was able to go to college out of state and have parents help support me, I will be graduating a year early, I am well traveled, I am happily out to friends. What I see, and what perpetuates my depression, is that: I am not out to my family, I worked hard in school but don't have a full-time job, my savings are almost out, I feel uncomfortable turning to friends for support, I don't think I'll ever be in a relationship.

Again, sorry for the long read, and I'm sorry if it's too scatterbrained. I'd be happy to clarify anything so you have a better understanding of my situation. I'm looking for objective advice from an outside perspective, or to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation. Thanks."
1f4oh0,1,2013-05-27,I'm sad and feel pointless.,snowluck2345,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1f4oh0/im_sad_and_feel_pointless/,"I don't think I'm depressed. I'm 17 and I just feel kinda sad and I feel alot of what I do is pointless. 

There are multiple facets of my life I'm sad and dissapointed about. I realize there is much I should be thankful and happy about, but I'm not and just feel sad. 

I have a home, a bedroom, enough physical space and enough food. I have most everything I could want, or have access to, things that are a physical possession. I have a computer, I have my power tools, I have my electronics tools, and I have internet. That is all I really need physicaly.

However while I feel I do have a good life and I don't have to worry where my next meal is coming from, or where I will sleep at night, I am still sad.

My parents are abusive, they have been as long as I can remember. My mom and dad are both verbally abusive to each other and to me, and both have been physically abusive to me in the past. 

Everyday I wake up to being cursed at, the whole ride into my highschool I am verbally abused, and I don't feel I have any space I can escape. I have door locks, but the last time I locked my doors to keep my parents out and put my headphones in so I couldn't hear them they broke my door. Normally my escape was school, I could go there and none of the persona issues from my home life would follow me. They would all evaporate. Wel most of them anyways, sometimes my grades have fallen because of my home life. I couldn't get an assignment done due to the police being called, or just not being able to focus due to all the screaming. But in general school was an escape for me.

However this year my mom has started involving school in our home fights. She will refuse to take me to school, which I have no issue with, assuming she gives me a days warning. I live 20 miles from my school, so when 20 minutes before school she says ""I'm not taking you"" I'm kinda screwed for the day. 

I'm going to miss my first period and its hard to maintain your grades, when you have to bike 2.5 hours per day, do 30 hours per week at work, practice for off season wrestling and diving, and make it to robotics team.

Then there is also when she attempts to get me in trouble with the principal. How does me locking my door have anything to do with school? I don't see it.

I'm dissapointed over my family issues and I feel without them I could have done much better in school.

For several months I didn't feel safe at home. My dad freaked out one nigh and attacked me. He tried to force his way in my room, while I was warning him to stay away. He tried to shove my door open but I blocked him in it. He was trying to punch me and I was just telling him to stay back. I wouldn't fight back because I was afraid if the police came I would be arrested. He tried to pin me with my bed frame, which was disassembled and up against a wall. He tried to punch me in the face. 

Ultimatly I no feel safe. I have started boxing, I realize that while he ways more than me, I  am stronger, I'm getting good at boxing, I can wrestle, and I will defend myself if he attacks me again. Self defense is a thing.

I wanted to call the police, my mom wouldn't let me because she said it would ruin my dad's job. However whenever they fight, she uses that as a power card: ""I'm going to call the police and get you arrested for attacking your son."" She never did, until he wouldn't buy her a card. I feel this action is manipulative and disgusting, she didn't care about my safety, she just cared about herself. 

 My mom is verbally abusive to me daily, as I stated earlier. The things she says are unfathomable and she knows just the things to make me upset. But god forbid I cry, because then I'm ""going crazy"". The last time I cried she checked me into the local hospital to be evaluated. The result: I told them exactly, at least from my view what was happening. CPS was supposed to intervene, I don't know what happened but they never came. Ultimately the experience wasn't bad as I had a safe area to work on my homework without distraction,  and the security guard wouldn't let my mom near me.

For years my mom has punished me in ways that make no sense to me, uinless their purpose is to make me upset. When I was a competitive, level 10 gymnast, she wouldn't let me go to practice, she wouldn't let me go to regionals, etc. Because she felt driving was too much work fr her. When I did wrestling she wouldn't take me to practice, or even let me bike in myself, as she didn't feel I should go. I put my headphones in when doing my homework to drown out my parent's fighting, which was some grievous sin in her mind. Diving, same story. Robotics, same story. 

The night before the regional meet she said you can't go. I guess I was looking sad the whole day because the team captain asked me what was up. Later that night, around 11pm, I went outside of the robotics room, walked over and hid behind a tree and cried. The team captain came out, a girl I had been becoming friends with over the months and asked me what was up. I said I was having some home issues but I was fine. I quickly got myself under control. I said I couldn't talk about it because I would just cry if I tried. 
I had been in a similar situation at gymnastics. The coach asked me what was happening, he new about my home issues and asked if there was anything he could do to help. I tried to talk but I just started crying.  I went anyways, but halfway thorough she called the coach. 
I was upset, she was ruining my chances to go to nationals. When  I heard I just walked away from the restaurant we were eating at and went for a walk. The team captain came out and asked me what was up. I said nothing, I just needed to go outside. She pressed more and I told her about my family issues. Everything, well most everything. She said she guessed I had an abusive homelife, she noticed that I always strayed away from being touched and seemed very tense when she did. She asked if I wanted a hug, I said no. She talked about how while she can't know what is like to hvae a poor homelife, she hoped it didn't affect me too mch and I should realize there are alot of people who care about you.

After this I don't know what happened, we stopped talking and are nolonger freinds. I don't know if it was me or her. I now think it may have been me, because for sevearl months after that I didn't even try to approach her to talk. I felt she wouldn't want to be freinds after I told her about my home issues.
I feel regretful, as I think telling her about my home problems made her not want to be freinds with me anymore and I kinda wish I hadn't. Th
However, I felt comfortable telling her based on that I felt we were really becoming freinds. We started talking a few months earlier in robotics. Early on she was freindly. She initialy was joking around about how much I could benchpress. She joked that she could beat me in wrestling and we should wrestle some time. We started talking more. We talked for several hours everyday of the week about whatever. Robotics at this time was 7 days a week, 70 hours plus per week, so we hung out alot. After a few weeks of talking alittle bit we were really becoming freinds, atleast I felt so. Alot of times we woudl ditch roobotics to go talk for a half hour, or just find something to do outside where there wasn't anyone else to talk. She told me about how she used to have a poor homelife, how her mom was nasty to her after her parent's divorce.  One day during robotics she was upset and I feel overall I did the proper thing, I asked her what was wrong, I gave her a hug. She waited with me after robotics for my mom to come pick me up, which I appreciated because it was cold and late (1pm). At this time she called the police to report a possible suicide attempt. A days earlier she offered to drive me home after robotics, initaly I said thank you, but no, its a far drive and I wouldn't want to burden you. She said I would really like to. On the way home she talked about earlier named freind who was depressed. A few days ago he asked her out, but she said no. She said if he asked where we were going to just say I had no other way to get home, and she was just helping me out. She told him she couldn't give him a ride home that night. Part of the way home we stopped and layed on her car staring at the stars. At this point i was slighltly confused as , this does seem like a slighlty romantic thing to do. However in the car ride she said she didn't want another boyfreind until college.  Once we got to my house she stayed for a few hours, we bounced on my trampoline nd then she went home. She said several times her mom was ok with having boys sleepover. 
We went out for lunch once and I feel we had a good time.
The first night of the reagional competitions hung out and talked for a while. It was really fun and kinda funny. She set my phone, my tablet, and all of the team tablets to pictures of us making funny faces.

Now I feel regretful over this because I feel we were good freinds, and she may have even like me, but I messed it up due to (a) my own ineptness, I wasn't able to tell if she like me or not, (b) my personal home issues, (c) my lack of confidence, and (d) rarely giving complements. A few times I said things like ""You are really beutifal"" and she siad thank you, that is really nice, returned compliments,b ut I didn't same them very often. Despite mixed messages, I feel she might have like me because we talked alot, we went out to like a school party thing together, and when I met her freinds they said things like ""You're cooler than she described"".

Now I regret telling her about my family issues and breaking off communication with her after doing it.

I'm regretful about my overall choices in highschool, kinda. I feel dissapointed in my GPA, while I had a 4.4 average in highshcool, my GPA was only 4.3 after my junior year and I feel it could have been higher, if I hadn't done sports, or I hadn't worked on my projects, or better yet I hand't lived with the family I lived with. If every day I wasn't kep up by my parents fighting until past 1am, and I didn't have 3 hour fights with my mom every night. From 9th until 11th grade I was putting in 30 hours per week for gymnastics, not including 2 hours per day of travel time. I had a few Bs. I got only 2200 on my SAT the first time I took it without studying, which while not bad, it isn't excellent. I feel I could have done so much better, if I had been in a different situation.

I feel like I want to be a jack of all trades, and while I am profficient in alot of things. I can TIG, MIG, and stick weld. I can solder, I can do elecronics, I can use a lathe, mill, I know G-code, I know C, C++, Java, Python, Pascal, Basic, Objective C... But i'm not a master at aything in particular. I do well, bt not excellent in school. I was a good gymnast, but not great. I was a good wrestler but not great. 

I'm dissapointed that I am not exccellent at anything that really matters. While Iccan make a stack of dimes in any position, I barly am scrapping by in Calculus BC. I was rejected from UC Berkely. While I can do manual work, that won't help me get a well paying job, unlike being an excellent programmer, or mathematician.

Wth myself physically, I am dissapointed. I look in the miror and I feel fat and I wish I had better abs. While wrestling I lost 25lbs, dropping from 160lbs to 135, and now looking back I wish I hadn't. I could be so much stronger and in better shape if I hadn't.

For college I'm going to UCSD, which while a good school, it isn't the best. I am going tobe screwed coming out, as my parents have not saved any money and due to my fathe's income I won't be getting any FAFSA money. 

I'm dissapointed in my choices, myself in general, and I can't help feeling I have a poor lot in life, even though I have a realtivly god life compared to some.

I feel nomatter how hard I try, it doesn't matter and everything I do is pointless.

Recently my mom has been trying to mess up my internship for me. She has stormed in and yelled at me. Trying to make me appear poorly and embarrass me. She hasn't done this when anyone else is there,b but still, this is not aplace where she should be. It is my work, it is not related to her and sh has no business there."

Whether its when I'm with my freinds and someone they know and I do not comes over, or if its after going out to lunch saying bye. In general I feel awkwardad I would like to feel less awkward.

I also sometimes feel awkward at my internship.

I started an internship a few months ago at a local startup company. Sometimes I feel alittle awkward there as everyone who is there graduated from Stanford and seem to be really brilliant. I sometimes feel alittle uncomfortable as I am only attending UCSD, which I think I will love, but is nowhere near the caliber of Stanford.  They seem to like me and act really cool, but I still fill a little out of place. 

I worry sometimes I am not meeting their expectations on what I should do, they haven't said anything negative, but then again, they never really have said anything even slightly negative. They are always just really positive. 

When they had some buddies over from Stanford they said I was their best intern and I would be getting an amazing letter of reccomendation, we all went out to lunch and it was a really fun time. I've also gone to block parties that were held nearby. I feel like they do like me, but I also feel I'm just tagging along for the ride and if I wasn't there it wouldn't really matter or be any different. One of the founder's brother's owns a company and allows me access to his machine shop.

I feel a little insecure. While based on what they have said an how they act it feels like I should be grounded and confident in my position, I can't help feeling that they would be this nice to anyone.

I feel in general I don't make much of an impact and what I do doesn't really matter.

1f4k78,7,2013-05-27,Can we have a frank discussion about immigration in the tech industry?,sixdrinks,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1f4k78/can_we_have_a_frank_discussion_about_immigration/,"RE: This article on the new immigation bill: 
http://news.yahoo.com/high-tech-industry-big-immigration-bill-winner-122335675.html

I work as a dev lead in a fortune 500 company. There are a lot of people from other countries on my team - Chinese, Indian, African. Most of them are great people. I feel really lucky to work with such a diverse group, but honestly I am uncomfortable with the number developers coming from other countries and how cheaply they are willing to work. I realize this is an age old issue: Immigrants filling a skill void and causing local animosity. But for several reasons, I can't help feeling like we are making a mistake. 

The main culprit in my opinion is that it is relatively difficult and costly for US students to get a decent technical education and succeed in the high-tech industry, compared to India and China. It's definitely not because China and India turn out such awesome programmers; they just have a system that can produce more technical degrees at a lower cost.

I would also submit that from a business standpoint one could argue that on-shoring makes financial sense, but like so many business trade offs, it doesn't necessarily make sense for the economy or society. 

I value the diversity, but the system appears to reward workers that come here, send their money home, and return after several years. These employees in general do not invest in their community, do not lay down roots, and are less likely to take ownership in local politics and societal issues. If they were truly immigrants I may feel differently (perhaps not better though).

Conclusion - I think we are losing the education investment game. I think we are taking the easy way out by giving away visa's for high tech jobs that most Americans would kill for. And I think companies are selling their communities short by not training new grads and bringing up interns. 

Thoughts anyone?"

Any suggestions from a UK resident?",datorbital,AskUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1f4jqu/newly_phd_in_pharmacology_hoping_to_move_abroad/,"Whats up, AskUK?  I just graduated this month at my professional school in Louisiana, USA. I now have a Ph. D. in pharmacology (with a minor focus in function and metabolism of angiotensin receptor antagonists/ACEI's) and also a Pharm D. My GPA ended up being around 3.69 and I'm 25 years old.

However, I was born and raised here in Louisiana, and I am very keen to leave. Going to the UK is a huge dream of mine, every since I vacationed there a few years ago, and also considering all there is to offer over there in terms of cancer research, among other things.

Is getting a work visa for the UK a simple thing? I've heard somewhere it's extremely difficult to get a work visa unless your job is quite specialized. Would Doctor of Pharmacology qualify? Either as a professor OR a research associate?

Also, how difficult would getting a job for me, being straight out of school, in England/Scotland/Wales? Is it unlikely that I could find a job this summer or autumn, given that I have little job experience (I worked as a pharmacy technician for 7 years in a retail pharmacy) to go on, or simply based on the job market at the moment? If experience was the main problem, what would you recommend in this situation? Local internships in the UK? Or working a few years in the States?

Basically, from anyone in this situation, or who knows a lot of stuff about all of this, what would your ""game plan"" be?

I'd love some advice from someone who's either dealt with this, or is currently living/working in the UK. Anyone with relevant and useful information more than just a quick Google search (I can do those, too :P ) is also greatly appreciated.

Also, I'm not looking to score some kind 100,000 pound per year job - more like a decent at whatever university will accept me in Great Britain.

Thanks!

My first choice was Geology but more research has made me look elsewhere as I'll need to at least complete a Masters degree meanwhile I can finish an MT degree in much less time and have a higher chance of finding a job afterwards.
I've narrowed it down to this.

**Geology**

Cons
 
-Much more difficult

-I’ll have to AT LEAST complete plenty of internships and a GIS certificate along with a masters just to make me competitive in the job market

-Fluctuating job market 

-Constantly relocating

-Start off doing blue collar labor work on well sites/mud logging 


Pros

-I also love biological sciences and hospitals intrigue me

-Higher earning potential ($60k-150k)

-I'm slightly more interested in this major

-More in touch with nature (I love hiking, mtb, etc)



**Medical Technologist (Clinical Laboratory Scientist)**

Cons

-Less pay ($35-70K)

-More stressful

-Less respect (Bossed around by Nurses and Doctors) 

Pros

-Less time in school

-Nearly guaranteed job security (especially in my area)

-Consistent pay and schedule

-No relocation

-Slightly easier (I'll finish with better grades which will make me more competitive than Geology)

She was his first love and ever since I remember, the entire family disprove her: 

* She said was pregnant, but the baby was not my brothers since they hadn't have sex according to him (she actually confessed the ""baby"" wasn't his), her mom said she rather pay an abortion (witch is still illegal where I live) than seeing them married.
* She cheated on him about 3 times (he just suspected,but according to him, wasn't sure since had no proof)
* Almost convinced him to not matriculate to college since she wanted to work and *start a life*(my folks own a place and he even ***suggested*** they should rent it to them)
* She called my **mom** a ""fat loser""

And many more I don't remember very much. At the time all this happened I was at college, far from home so I wasn't really in much contact with him, only weekends when I came back home. But even then, I realized something changed about him: he was perky, curious and quite social...then he became quite dark, unhappy and sometimes locked himself because *she did something...* or *she said something...* he used to tell me.

A few months ago, they **FINALLY** broke up and he wasn't even mad about it. At first, they were still talking but he became *perceptive*  (I quote him) and realized that was stupid. After that, things started to look **WAY BETTER**: he started an awesome internship, was studying to get into college and was even offered a job!! I even convinced him to become a redditor witch, according to him ""improved his life 1,356% more""... I was happy and he was the one I used to remember.

A couple of weeks ago, some of his ex's relative told him she was seeing (surprisingly) someone...he just put a pillow over his head and wasn't talking to **NO ONE**...not even me. It was painful to watch and heartbreaking to realized how much power this ""woman"" had over him.

Just today, this girl **dared** to call him. He was so enthusiastic and **insisted** ""it's just a call, I want to talk to her""... I tried to explain to him how **I** saw it...but he was totally convinced there was nothing wrong about talking to her, even though he's not even over her. Even suggested they might get back. I told him ""I'm just trying to protect you"" and he just...walked away and return her call.

What should I do? How should I help him? I feel incompetent and impotent-being his big sibling I feel responsible...What can I do? How do I approach him and make him realized the mistake this would be? Should I just step away and wait another 2 years of his suffering and being a miserable human being who feels is not good enough for anyone but her? Help me.Please.

1f480j,1,2013-05-26,Can Someone Please Help Me Build A MultiPurpose Rig Please?,dcd1990,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1f480j/can_someone_please_help_me_build_a_multipurpose/,"&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

The main purpose of this rig will be to run a virtual Ubuntu FTP server, with Windows 8 Pro as the host OS.  Light gaming will be done on it, nothing too fancy..mainly: Halo CE, KOTOR, AC 1 and 2, Maplestory, Risk, Slender, possibly Minecraft (doubt I'l install texture packs, etc).  Most newer games I will play on PS3 or PS4 when it releases.  I will run a few virtual emulators on here, such as a virtual gameboy advance and PS2.  Other than that, I'll be doing general web browsing, MS Office work, and very light Photoshop work. 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I will have to get peripherals too, so I'd rather keep everything under a $2000 budget as much as possible.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I cannot do this build for a while, probably for another month since that's when my internship starts.  I wanted to start planning now though so I could get an idea of what I'm looking at getting.  I've done some builds with friends, but thought it couldn't hurt to get Reddit's opinion too.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

This build will be nearly completely from scratch.  I think at best the only thing I could contribute to it is an Intel 330 series solid state drive.  Oh, and an okay 2.1 speaker set (I'm not a huge audiophile). This would make my laptop completely useless though, although admittedly the system board on it is going.  Other than that, I would need the monitors, keyboard, mouse, tower components, and most of the cables.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I'd prefer to get most of these parts at Microcenter, as I have one that's close by in PA. I wouldn't mind getting some at Tiger Direct or Newegg if it's going to be a decent increase in specs for around the same price.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

As I said, I think I'd only be reusing a SSD I have in my laptop.  

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I would rather not get into overclocking, as I'd rather not get into water cooling or overclocking itself for this rig.  This is for CPU, RAM and GPU.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Two 2TB HDDs in RAID 1...I've had one too many HDDs fail on me due to a combo of misuse and bad luck, so I'd rather not have to keep rebuilding multimedia again.

USB 3.0 on the front would be amazing.

If the case could come with built in blue LED fans, that would be great...

Blue backlit keyboard would be awesome too

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Pretty much what I already said above...having a window to view in would be really nice.  However if there are blue LED fans that can be seen from the outside of the case, I wouldn't mind no window or a mesh like covering for it.  Low noise would be awesome, but isn't super necessary.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Uh...good question.  My MSDN license is still good until mid July.  I should be good until then, if not I'll get one separately.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

I will be using a triple monitor setup for this rig, something I've been set on for a while.  I'd prefer the monitors to match, have a 5ms response time or less, support 1080p + and have HDMI and DVI compatibility.

&gt;Other notes:

I'll update this as I think of anything else, but I believe that I got everything.  This will be my first build and I'm tech savy to a degree but not on par with some of you guys.  This helps me out a lot. Thanks again for your help in advance everyone!  "

First off, let me preface my description with a huge shout out to Riot. First of all, that event was the best one that you’ve ever pulled. On a more personal level, I want to extend a HUGE thanks for your help in getting me in the event. I’m not at liberty to go into specifics, but basically, the way tickets were sold were that they could only be ordered with a QQ account and a level 15 China LoL account. This wouldn’t have been a problem, as I have friends in China who could have easily helped me out, but the thing was, there was no readily available information for how I could go about ordering it, and I had a bit of trouble. Even scalpers were unavailable (until the day of, I later found out) because the tickets were distributed by SMS which meant you weren’t able to get a physical copy of a ticket. Then came a certain Rioter with his kayle ult and divine intervention’d this situation straight out of the water. Basically, Riot es numero uno.  
Entering the stadium is pretty routine, you had to go past security which was almost useless (that’s common in China, like in the Shanghai Metro where getting your bags scanned is technically required but in reality “optional”). You go past a few food stands, and see a huge line for a certain one. The merchandise stand. (see album) The exchange rate is about 6.2 CNY per USD.  
Entering the arena itself, you are instantly blown away. The entire stage is animated, initially with I can only describe as if the Firefox logo pulled a nyancat and left that in its trail. (I didn’t pay attention in English when we were forced to work on our descriptions). The crowd wasn’t extremely loud, but it was pretty homogenous in how everyone was Chinese except maybe 2%. The first thing to notice from the stage (from my potato-camera on my iStone 5, sorry &gt;.&lt;) is that the minimaps are located about 15 feet in front of the players. Clearly Riot learns from its mistakes and adjusts accordingly. However, the general game screen was still behind the players, and I felt that a few players purposely turned their heads to “talk” to their teammates when they were hoping to catch a sneak peek at the gamescreen.  
Now, the introductions, not on the same scale as that epic Orchestra at worlds, but hey, this is China, nobody actually cares, they just wanted to see 1 thing and 1 thing only (more on that later). Introduce the teams, yadda yadda yadda (Chinese girls screaming over Saint Fishsticks and Alex Ich). Then, LPL’s team. You could hear the stadium shaking as EVERYONE starts going crazy. There are always some doubters (especially against XX, who people still criticize to this day for a single bad Sona ult from way back when, as if nobody makes mistakes.) But the arrival of the Wei Xiao^3 combo raises the roof. Day starts, etc, 1 v 1 maps, pretty awesome, that’s all great.  
Now to the games:  
The right and left side screens displayed current Bo3 score, Dragon and Baron timer, number of towers and kills, and the amount of gold each team had. The screens directly behind players that were really long rectangles initially showed greyed out slideshows of champion splash arts, but once they locked in, showed a colored picture of their champion behind them. The square screens right above that displayed the player’s faces throughout the game. There were 2 large game screens, with the bottom one showing the same thing as the top, except with a banner. The top one would flash to a color-coded message when there was a FB, or an ace. Each of the players had a podium-like thing where they sat, and usually in games it would display their champion along with health bar.  
Throughout the day, Riot would come on stage or on the floor and start throwing out stuff like they did at worlds. At worlds, they gave away Gangplank oranges and Soraka ‘nanas I think, but here they gave away Ziggs (Q) bombs and Lulu (W) cupcakes. The area I sat at was in the vicinity of a bunch of Riot members along with Dadyrus (awesome man, CRAZY tall).  
The crowd overall I didn’t like very much. It wasn’t crowded, per se, but I felt that their attitudes were wrong. The tickets were extremely cheap (cheapest were 50CNY ~ 8USD), which made people not appreciate the experience as much in my opinion. Most of the people who were sitting in the back rows left immediately after China was done with its games, and only really cheered for China’s team. Home team advantage all that, yadda yadda yadda, but I feel that they should also have been more welcoming towards EVERYONE, because they took time out of their lives to come and put on the best show possible.   
If there’s anything else you wanted to ask, feel free to do so in comments I’m here all day (Internship in Shanghai = bored zzzzzzzzzzzzzz).  
TL;DR: Riot is literally the bestttt.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How come these things won't visit US ports? Just no West Coast port big enough to handle them? And if not, why not?  I understand these ships are pretty brutal to the environment. Do you see any technology or practices on the horizon that might make them a little less harmful?  Is this size of ship going to be the new standard to stay competitive on those routes now?   A lot of Europe-Asia air traffic is being flown through Middle Eastern airports (or Istanbul\), a vast change from even a decade ago. Is there the same shift in sea cargo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7qozw?context=5)|The real problem is not the size of the ports it's that the ports use outdated technology. Ports in China and Europe are highly automated and they can move containers at and amazing rate. American ports are slow because the unions fear that automation will cost their members jobs and because union rules support policies that lead to slower load rates (the longer it takes, the more hours union members rack up. One expert told me that this ship could be offloaded in Europe in 2-3 days but it would take the port of Los Angeles over a week to offload her... And Maersk can not afford to leave an expensive ship like this one tied to the dock for that long.  These ships are brutal on the environment on a per ship basis but on a per container basis they are much more efficient than any other form of transport (e.g. Trains, trucks, etc). So the environment would benefit significantly if containers were moved across this CPU try (through the canal) then aboard trucks and trains. This is called ""short sea shipping"" and is how European cargo gets moved... But it's something lobbyists have fought for years.
 |Yes, expert believe this will be the new standard in 10 years but... Only time will tell.
[*blasphemy, how dare you insult the sanctity of the union maritime worker!* ~sincerely, NY tugboat operator tired of his useless union. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca81k6a?context=5)|Well the Sandy Hook pilots are just across the bay and they are non-union, right... maybe they have a few openings ;)
 |(Yes, I'm joking)
[Do you think that by trying to avoid automation to save union jobs and provide more union hours, these ports might be bringing about their own demise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7v1qi?context=5)|They can't do more harm to themselves then they already have, so no, I don't think they will demise but they are preventing their own growth.
 |If we adopted Europe's methods then we would move containers onto smaller ships to more efficiently get the containers closer to their destinations... That would mean two more loads per container for every crane operator which translates to lots more jobs. Of course, it would mean less jobs for truck drivers but this will happen anyway as new ports are currently being built in Mexico.
[As a member of the shipping industry in the US now pursuing a degree in logistics, this comment infuriates me to no end. It seems every inefficiency on our side comes back to Unions, and its usually true, having witnessed it first hand. Between local government interference and union hustling it sometimes amazes me anyone is willing to do business here.  That said, I find this industry absolutely fascinating and look forward getting more involved in it after college. Your blog looks like a great resource. Working for Maersk is one of my goals. Did you enjoy your time with the company? Though I hope to work port-side in some sort of intermodal capacity, any chance of getting some time at sea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca82oaz?context=5)|Well if the unions infuriate you then you're in for a treat... Just look up e work ""MARAD"" in the index of your text book and you'll learn about one organization that makes the unions look like time travelers from the future.
[How many bags of heroin does your boat hold?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n27v?context=5)|What, didn't you see Mark Wahlberg's film ""Contraband""? There are a thousand places to hide heroin, weapons and people on a ship like this. 
[I was going to ask what it's like to have Mark Wahlberg smuggle stuff on your ship.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7nifp?context=5)|Mark's a nice guy but got an attitude when I said the only thing worse than New Kids is a Funky Bunch album ;)
[But seriously, did you ever have crew that would try that stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7nifp?context=5)|I've certainly heard rumors and had reason to suspect they were true but... no, I've never caught anyone in the act. Like I said, it's a big ship with thousands of hiding spaces... the only way to be caught is to either be really dumb or get stopped on your way on and off the ship. 
[SO HOW MANY BAGS OP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7nmi7?context=5)|Thousands of kilos. Hiding vast quantities of anything is easy, you just open the hatch to a void space and drop the stuff in, the only limit is your ability to get the stuff on and off the ship.
[Ahh, the ol' Han Solo technique.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7vjse?context=5)|""I use them for smuggling kid. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous!""
[How many Zapp Brannigan quotes were you able to use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mkw0?context=5)|Only one: ""She's a beautiful ship alright. Shapely. Seductive. I'm gonna Fly Her Brains Out!""
 |My favorite quotes as a captain was Steve Zissou's classic line ""Hey intern, go plug this in and make me a Latte.""  (a captain has to have his coffee!)
[What kind of crew does a ship like that need? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7m22q?context=5)|The  minimum crew required by law is only 14 people but Maersk plans on crewing her with at least 20. Shocking considering that a Nimitz class carrier holds more than 5000 people ( Ship's Company: 3,000-3,200, air wing: 1,500, other: 500) and is 67.2 meters (220 feet) shorter in length!
[How does that break down? (i.e. 3 bridge crew + 3 engineers x 3 shifts?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7metf?context=5)|Top of the food chain are the Captain (in charge of everything) and the Chief Engineer (in charge of the enige room and anything mechanical)
 |Bridge team: 3 officers (Chief mate, 2nd mate, 3rd mate) 3 lookouts (Able Bodied or Ordinary Seaman)
 |Engine team 3 officers (1st Assistant Engineer, 2nd AE, 3rd A/E) 3 oilers.
 |Steward's department (in charge of food, laundry, etc) 1 Steward (In charge of ordering food and cooks the breakfast) 1 Cook 1 Assistant.
 |3 DEU's (junior crewmembers who are pulled by any department that needs them)
[Out of curiosity, what do the stewards get paid? (I cook for a living\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7rz5l?context=5)|The non-union stewards get paid peanuts and usually have less vacation time than the rest of the crew. I don't know exact numbers but union stewards get decent pay plus can get significant amounts of overtime if the captain approves it (which he usually does if the food is good).
[Considering boat crews are often international, I'm assuming the English is the lingua Franca on these type of ships?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7tfg8?context=5)|Yes, that is correct. 
[A ship that large almost seem impractical.  How many ports are large enough to hold such a big ship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mgp7?context=5)|Not many... She only plans on calling on 13 ports all in Asia and Europe. She won't be coming to the united states. 
[Is making a single large ship more efficient than making a number of smaller ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7pztl?context=5)|Yes, but that's only half the equation... It's also that transporting 18,000 containers at once is more efficient than making two 9,000 container trips.
[Does it take the same time to load/unload though on per container basis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca80ceq?context=5)|Good question but I'm not  sure of the answer.
[How is it to handle a big ship like that? How much do you have to plan everything  before, to make your ship react at the right time? How long does it take to make a full stop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mnd8?context=5)|Yes everything has to be very well planned. We won't know exactly how long it takes this ship to make a full ""crash astern"" stop but 15 ship lengths is fairly typical of a large ships so... 6000 meters or 20,000 feet.
 |But the ocean is wide open, so very little maneuvering is needed once the ship reaches open ocean. The difficult part is maneuvering in port but stopping distance is not much of an issue for two reasons: 1) Ships move slowly in port 2) They are escorted by powerful tugs which can stop them quickly and help them turn ""on a dime"".
[I took a cruise recently from Tampa to Grand Cayman, then Mexico and back to Tampa.  I spent a good amount of time staring over the side hoping to glimpse fish, dolphins, whales, anything.  Other than 2 flying fish, I saw nothing. Nothing at all.  Is there a trick to seeing stuff, like a certain time, or in front or behind the ship?  Ever see any cool fish or anything like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n9i2?context=5)|In my experience their are only two factors to seeing those things: luck and location.
 |The key is to ask the crew were are the spots they most often see marine life... then ask them what time the ship will pass those locations. If they won't tell you then you best bet is to watch during times you are in sight of (but no too close to) land.
 |My favorite are the sea turtles!  You can be over a 1000 nautical miles from the closest point of land and see a turtle slowly paddling alone. They are really slow... and it boggles my mind how (even with favorable currents) they can travel so far on their own.
[What was the most exhilarating experience you had as captain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7ltka?context=5)|Probably the rogue wave which, luckily, I only witness first hand on one occasion. It was in 2002 and the water was dead calm and we had jsut rounded the southern tip of Africa when I caught the thing from the corner of my eye. I don't know how big it was but I was about 40 feet above the waterline on a 500 foot ship and, just before we hit it, I was looking up at the thing. Scary as hell.
 |The good news is that we only hit it due to my relative inexperience at the time and incompetence as a navigator because the location of these things is well charted, known among scientists and easily avoided... so I don't plan on running into one again. 
[Er.. the location of rogue waves are well charted???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7miv8?context=5)|Yes they are fairly well charted on the latest versions of the charts... but it's only been in the last 10-15 years that we have known anything about them.
 |Now there are 2 basic types of Rogue Waves, those that form in the middle of giant storms and the Freak type that seem to come out of nowhere.

[As much as you are allowed to discuss, what was your company's standard procedure for dealing with pirates, and did you have weapons or other ways of deterring them? Do some companies hire private security firms, like Blackwater? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7m21v?context=5)|Well the last time I sailed as Captain was 3 years ago and many ships still were not allowed to carry any weapons or hire any private security firms. Most companies still discourage the crew from bringing aboard their own weapons but do allow the use of private security firms.
[Not allowed, this is really surprising!  Considering the dollar amount of the cargo on the ships, it's shocking that security firms are not allowed.  Not allowed by whom, I wonder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7pb5h?context=5)|I ment to say that, yes, today security teams are allowed on ships.
[So as recently as three years ago, multi-billion dollar cargo ships had less security than Disneyland?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7pb5h?context=5)|Yes, three years ago, most didn't have more than a set of handcuffs and a batton... Much less then Disney!
[Could you use the boat to ram the pirates' dinghy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7rplc?context=5)|Yes but only if the dinghy holds it's course...
[Do pirates usually have the ability to forcibly board a ship that large?  It seems like you could just ignore them and steam on.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7v4gr?context=5)|Pirates would have a very difficult time boarding a ship this big and fast.
 |Most ships that have been taken have had either a low freeboard (distance from the water to the deck) or a low top speed.

[How do you guys view the efforts by the taskforce stationed in the middleeastern and asian seas, and what improvments could be made?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7xu2e?context=5)|Private security teams aboard the ships and simple precautions like straining razor wire around the gunwales is proving to be the most effective deterrent. 
[How much is the ship worth? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n43i?context=5)|This ship is costing Maersk $190 million to build but they signed the contract before the economy tanked. Today you could commission a yard to build this ship for around $150 million.
[I'm fascinated with ships like this and how they operate.  You said in another question the minimum crew on one of these ships is at least 14, what does everyone do all day?

Are there any recreation options other than playing cards or reading?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7r53g?context=5)|The captain works 8 hours (mostly behind a desk) but is on call 24/7.
 |The rest of the crew typically work three 4 hour shifts. Two of those shifts are standing watch (on the bridge, engine room or in the kitchen).. The third shift is doing routine maintenance and inspections.
 |Lots and lots of time for card playing, reading or watching the months worth of stuff you downloaded via pirate bay.. 
[So some could call you...a pirate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7ukou?context=5)|The MPAA certainly would ;)

If it happens and they are discovered what is the protocol?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7rttf?context=5)|The protocol for finding one after you leave port depends on your company policy and the laws of the port you are heading to. At a minimum you must give hem a bed and food then notify immigration prior to arriving at your destination. From there you must follow the orders of the immigration officer who will usually fine the ship and launch an investigation. 
[Do your engineers not just do day work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7yzm9?context=5)|It depends on if the ship has an automated engine room or not but, You're right, on this ship they do.

Usually the food is very good but heavy (mostly comfort food).
[So making them walk the plank isn't an option?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca81sbl?context=5)|No but I hear rumors that it still happens since there is a lot you ""could"" get away with if the closest police station was 1000 miles away, you had a week to clean up the evidence and if you were floating directly above a 15,000 foot deep trash can filled with man eating sharks...
[If the ship gets fined what is the motivation to notify immigration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca8244y?context=5)|A bigger fine and/or imprisonment if you don't notify immigration.
[What ship(s\) did you Captain? Merchant Marine? If so do you have a son and if so did you name him Nathaniel like every other Captain in the Merchant Marine? You seem a bit young for that gig.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7m7ob?context=5)|I am a bit young for the gig but there has been a massive shortage of qualified mariners int he last 5-10 years as the economies of china and india have expanded. When I first joined it was rare to find a captain under the age of 45... today many are in their early 30's.
 |Nathaniel is a strong name but my wife vetoed anything too nautical so we named him Jack.
[Is this the biggest machine a single man can ""drive""? How does it feel to be behind the wheels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n4mf?context=5)|Sure is... unless you find a time machine that can travel a long time ago to a galaxy far away.
 |It feels awesome, like having a super power, the only downer is that the ship's wheel is rather small and puny. 
[Is most of the driving done by computer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca82j8r?context=5)|Yes, the ship has autopilot which is controlled by an ""integrated bridge system"" (a windows based computer)
[I've been a long time follower of your site, and I'm glad to see you doing something like this.  My question is: when do you think the other carriers will debut ships of equal size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7p0tk?context=5)|Jus last month China Shipping put in an order for five ships of this size and e others are likely to follow. The only thing that's holding them back is the fact that shipping rates are currently at a historic low... but this will change as (let's hope!)  the economy continues to improve.
[With more ships of this size being built and only ever increasing cargo shipping, do you think the Suez and Panama canals will be widened to accommodate the extra width?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7p602?context=5)|The Panama Canal is, right now, being widened.. But it still won't be large enough to accept a ship of this size.  The Suez Canal, however, is already plenty wide (and deep!) enough for this ship.
[Have you seen the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7p602?context=5)|No... Most of my time has been in the Atlantic and Indian oceans but I have seen plenty of trash. It's still rare to see a large patch of it but is certainly depressing when you do!
[Any close calls with pirates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mafa?context=5)|Their are two basic types of pirates... those who steal stuff and run (found around the world but most prevalent in the Strait of Malacca). These ones typically only steal stuff you have left exposed on deck  (they love brass firehose fittings and thick hawsers).
 |The other, more dangerous, type of pirate are those in Somalia who take over and ransom the entire ship.
 |Personally I have seen a few of the former pirates but none of the latter but I have friends who've seen both. The closest I've come to the dangerous type of pirates was as a blogger... I called the bridge of the Maersk Alabama (via skype!) to verify the story of her capture before it broke in the news.
[How would a pirate board a ship as tall as yours? Sorry if this is a dumb question. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7xshc?context=5)|Grappling hooks and rope ladders but the pirates prefer to board slower ships with lower freeboard (the distance deform the water to the ship's deck)
[Do you guys use scooters to get around the ship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7mc9q?context=5)|No but scooters are the preferred method of transport in most of the large shipyards where the ships are built. On ships larger than 1000; feet you will often find a couple of bicycles on deck for getting to/from the bow.
[As a captain, how much of your time awake is actually spent doing something ship related? I can't imagine there being too much needing to be taken care of if you're on a month long run from Asia to Europe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7ouqm?context=5)|A decade ago you would be correct, there isn't too much that needs to get done during a month long run but, the invention of satellite Internet means that today's captain has access to the Internet, Skype and email. While this sounds good (and mostly it is) it also comes with the problem of micromanagement... The shoreside managers love to fill any free time with paperwork. So, in short, today's captain stays rather busy.
[How did you get your start? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n62f?context=5)|I went to SUNY Maritime College in the bronx... a state university that gives you a college degree and a license to drive really big ships. 
[Seriously, can the chef legally kill pirates if the ship is attacked? A 30% raise and a reasonable risk to my life would be interesting, if not awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7yuj0?context=5)|Yes you can certainly defend yourself if they attack... but, depending on the company policy and the laws of the flag state, you may have to use your kitchen knives to do it.
[What goes through an average captain's mind in really rough seas?  Is it like, ""I'm a badass captain, and if I keep my cool, I've got this,"" or ""Oh shit, I really hope I make it out of this one?""  Videos like this are what prompt my question: Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7se2w?context=5)|Well, you have to instill confidence in the crew so outwardly you say ""I'm a badass captain, and if I keep my cool, I've got this,"" But, as long as everything's well secured and there are no signs of structural failure, then all that's really going through your mind is ""F me, I wish I was home surfing Reddit!"".
[Ever played hide and seek with the crew???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7r5o9?context=5)|No but I played ""hide from my boss"" plenty of times when I first started out ;)
[As someone from a family of shipbuilders, I can indeed confirm that you have a very impressive boat. :\)  I also have friends who operate on ships like these in the South Pacific. They have plenty of great tales. Who knows, maybe I'll end up on one one of these days.  So yeah, question time: what's the fastest the boat can go when fully loaded? And how long does a round trip take? Say from Singapore to Rotterdam?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7sxw2?context=5)|Her top speed is 23knots (26 mph) but Maersk plans on sailing her at 20. The first voyage will begin in Shanghai, and she will sail from China to Spain in 20 days... so round trip would be 40 plus 3 days to offload her.
[How much does a ship that big Bend and twist, on a calm day also stormy day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7uul5?context=5)|Ships are solid in calm weather but you can often feel vibrations from the engine room (even if it's on the other end of the ship).
 |They bend a lot in heavy weather. The first major storm I was in was aboard a 1000 foot tanker and I watched as the bow twisted one way, and the stern twisted another, as she hit a wave. I called the captain up to the bridge and he said ""Twisting's a good thing, it means that the steel isn't brittle. But if she stops twisting then grab a lifejacket and run to the lifeboat.""
[This is completely off topic. If the world entered into a war on the scale of WWI and WWII, do you think it would still be effective to employ the convoy tactics of prior wars or what strategies would merchant navies have to adopt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7pwva?context=5)|Good question and, to be honest, I don't know the answer because most of us commercial mariners are civilian and the navy admirals don't like sharing classified information (or war studies) with us.
 |But if I had to guess I would think that convoys would be dangerous because a large mass of ships is easier to spot on satellite images and easier to pick up on a submarine's sonar. 
[I know that some cargo ships rent out cabins to paying passengers. Have you had any experience traveling with passengers? What's it like having a passenger on a working ship? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7u939?context=5)|No, I haven't been on a ship that accepts passengers and this ship, the Maersk Triple-e, doesn't have any accommodations for passengers but... the second largest containership does!
 |From the CMA website: ""The CMA CGM MARCO POLO includes 5 double modern cabins of 20m2 each, a lounge with TV equipment, a library, a fitness room and even a swimming pool.""
 |You won't be traveling in luxury but I'd still highly recommend it... booking passage on the Marco Polo would be an experience that you'd never forget.

But my website, gCaptain, does have a sailor on staff. His name is rob and his contact info is in the ""Team"" section of the site (lineked to in the footer).
 |I will say that you are a braver man than I am Gunga Din! The worst storm I've seen was when I navigated a 1000 foot oil taker from valdez alaska... and I wished I was on a larger boat! I don't know how the guys from the Deadliest Catch do it.
[I've heard the value of the cargo a ship like that can hold is in the billions, true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7qi3v?context=5)|I am not sure of the exact figures and Maersk wouldn't tell me (much of the information about what is in the containers is kept secret by Maersk for the privacy of their customers) but they did say that, if a Triple-e class ship with 18,000 containers were lost, then it would be the largest marine insurance claim ever.
[Can I take her for a spin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7my7w?context=5)|Sure but you'll have to get on line after me... unfortunately Maersk didn't offer me the Captain's job during the tour and, after they read this, it's unlikely that they will ;)
[This is probably a rookie question but what are the economics of a ship this sized being nuclear powered? Short term I assume it would be a bit more expensive but wouldn't it be cheaper in the long term?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7x1g9?context=5)|Yes, the economics work out in the long run but construction and decommissioning are both very expensive. Then you have unexpected problems like labor disputes (what i the proper pay considering the danger) and port calls (some countries, like New Zeeland, ban all nuclear ship).
 |But if you want to learn more about this, I suggest you pic up a book about the ""n/s savannah"", the only nuclear powered commercial ship ever built in the US.
[You quit being a sea captain to be a blogger?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7y6qa?context=5)|I launched my blog, gCaptain.com, while I was still working at sea and for the frist three years I did both jobs. Then the BP Oil Spill happened and I signed a deal with Harper Collins to write the book on that tragic event. By that time the blog was doing very well and, combined with the book advance, I was able to quit my ""day job"" as captain.  Today, 6 years after the blog was launched, my salary is still below what I was making as a captain but I love to write, especially about ships, and enjoy being home every day for my kids.
[How long are you out at sea for a typical run? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n3ut?context=5)|I'm not sure of Maersk's policy but American sailors (and most sailors from the western world) typically work 3 or 4 months per ""hitch"" then have the same amount of vacation time (3/4 months). But most of the ships are run by Russians, Filipino's and Chinese sailors who typically work 6-9 months per hitch.

(bulk carrier\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7opl6?context=5)|My best advice is to work on many different types of ships during the first few years of your career. Too many people get pigeoned holed on one type of vessel and get bored after decades at sea... it's better (and easier) to discover what type of ship fits you best before you get stuck in one career track.
[So where and how do I get into being on a ship for a living?

[Thanks! a guy told me that a biggish passenger ferry can come to a full stop in it's own length in the archipelago (speed limit 12 kt\), how does that compare to your ships? how much fuel would that take?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7n0lo?context=5)|I misplaced the tank capacity but here's a picture of the individual ship ""mega-block"" sections. 31 of these sections (some not so large and some, like the bridge, look totally different) are placed side-by-side to build the ship. 2 of these massive sections are fuel oil tanks that will be completely filled with heavy fuel oil... so, the answer is, a lot!
[I'm a cadet and I'm doing my training exclusively on Bulk Carriers. Do you think when I qualify this will prevent me from working on other types of ships? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7por9?context=5)|Yes, it will restrict your options but not until you reach the level of Chief Mate,

This ship will fly the Danish flag.
[On the environmental and running costs on these behemoths: they're costing upwards $150 million, why not deck them out with solar panels that would cover the topmost layer of containers? With a surface area of that size I imagine a fair amount of energy could be harnessed. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca7vfzm?context=5)|That's a good idea, and the concept is already being tested aboard the car carrier ""M/V Auriga Leader""... but, on container ships, cranes pluck the containers off the deck, so any solar panels would have to be removed each time the ship docked in port. This sounds simple to do but on a vessel this size, the panels would be massive and difficult to move.
 |There are a bunch of radical designs out their including, my favorite idea, using kites to help power ships. Here's the article I wrote in 2010 on the top ten green ship designs: [Link to gcaptain.com](http://gcaptain.com/ocean-kites-top-10-green-ship-designs/)
[I'm a US Navy junior officer.  One thing that's come up before, are you allowed to deviate from your course, or does the company expect you to follow the most fuel efficient track?  There have been times where we asked merchant ships to divert a few dozen miles because we were conducting military exercises and they refused and just sailed right through.  What do you do when you have to cross through a giant, several-mile-wide fishing fleet?  Our warships are very maneuverable so we ""slalom"" through.  Do you just hope they move out of the way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1f7rb1/iam_a_ship_captain_back_from_the_worlds_most/ca84bxp?context=5)|Ships: No, they have plenty of time built in to deviate. They can maneuver but most are foreign who speak lousy english and are not fans of the US military. The rest are too lazy to plot a new course or asleep.  1) If they don't respond then use your DSC to set off their bridge alarm (you can also use DSC to change the channel on their radio remotely... which sometimes solves the problem. 2) If you still can't get through then pick up your sat phone and call their Captain's state room directly.

Fishing Fleets: On my first night watch as a brand new third mate aboard an 873ft Military Sealift Command ship hauling barges from Oakland to Camp Pendleton. It was 04:15 (my relief was late) when we started passing through the fishing fleet sailing  out from Morro Bay. Heading south, had the right of way and I was able to raise all the boat with a close CPA... all except one. That guy was sleeping down below with his radio turned off. Lucky for him my ship was steam powered and had the biggest steam whistle I've ever seen... I blasted that thing and it work him from a dead sleep at 100 yards. Scared the sh!t out of me.

The biggest thing I realized is that I watch my roommates smoke and I think, How did I just sit here all day and do nothing but consume with them. I watched them fiend just trying to find a place to cop. It just looks sad to me and I'm upset that I was like that.

I am exercising, losing weight, and I'm generally more personable than I've been in a while. I will never let myself to get back to the way I was before where my day was centered around smoking weed. I feel like my potential has been wasted and I'm trying to get it back."

So I'm a rising sophomore looking to study MatSci next year, and I made a huge mistake this summer. I was planning on working full time over the summer at my school's climbing facility while I take a class in the mornings. Unfortunately, between a mix of a ridiculous amount of new hires (to fill students who left for the summer) and some budget cuts, my hours are way less than I expected.

As a result of this, I completely missed out on applying to be a research assistant (I've already gotten in touch with all my prof's), my morning class and lack of car keeps me from getting an internship (if I don't take this class now I fall a year behind), and now a lot of the small shops around campus have already made their summer schedules and aren't really hiring.  

I'm determined to get something out of this summer, and I feel like teaching myself a language like Python or something along those lines would be a great resume booster. I've already taken an intro C++ class, and I've had experience with MATLAB, but I wonder if there are any additional (free) resources out there for those 2, or if anyone knows any good resources or languages to check out? My school has a ton of free online books available to students, so chances are if anyone recommends a book I can get access to it. "

The majority of stuff I have left are math classes. The problem is that the logistics of getting to the math classes is a pain. The campus I attend only has a few of the classes and I'd need to put in about a 90+ min commute to get to the other campus to take the math classes throughout fall (maybe summer) and probably next spring to graduate.

I liked the early math classes (calc, stats) stuff I've taken already and really want to do this but I'm worried that 12 months of this kind of commute will just kill me and really make it hard to take an internship on the side if I'm commuting so much to class.

I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with the degree, consulting, actuary, real estate are a few of the things I'm thinking of.

I'm really interested in being smart at Math. I love tech (I've taken coding and data classes on the side at Coursera and other places), and just think that it's a thing I'd like to know. I'm not sure exactly how it would make me a better canidate for a job, but I'm afraid that economics alone isn't enough.  

PS I could graduate a semester earlier (Dec 2013) if I drop the math part of the major. Here's a copy of the program

1f854w,2,2013-05-28,Considering $20000 loan for a Master's degree in IR,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1f854w/considering_20000_loan_for_a_masters_degree_in_ir/,"Hello,

I have a BS degree in International Relations from a top 25 US public university. I have built a solid resume for the type of work I want to pursue. I studied abroad in Europe for 1 academic year and made exceptional grades. I completed a research internship in Europe and an internship at my US university. I have a consistent record of remedial work experience (retail &amp; restaurants, whatever).

See, the problem with just having a BS degree in the political field is that most of the IGO's, NGO's, MNC's, and related firms, all require an advanced academic degree. I want to work for these political firms in crisis management, global security, political risk assessment in obscure economic regions, and/or related posts. The field of IR is my passion and I have big interests in this particular field.

A lot of the firms I would ultimately enter work for at 25-30 years old would be paying in the $3,500/mo range straight out of the gate with a MA in IR. However, it appears people with ~10 years of experience are seeing salaries of roughly $8,000/mo after putting in hard time with some of these international firms.

I've been accepted to the Uni that offers this unnamed program. I don't want to reveal the location of where I'll be studying or the ultimate program. I like to keep my financials private.

I am 24 years old, no kids, from upper middle class family, monthly payments so far never been a problem. However, I've got a debt of $90k for the BS degree and would have to stack $20k more on top of that. My parents pledge $700 a month for my loan for the initial years of my career so I've caught a break there.

Estimated advantages of a 2 year masters in unnamed foreign country:
1) solidify my foreign language skills
2) 2 additional years of international experience
3) potential internships

I feel that since I've racked up $90k for this BS, topping it off with $20k MA degree is a pretty good icing on the cake and I'd be able to enter the workforce with some added flexibility. I was hoping I could settle in a prosperous European city in a flatshare for €600 a month until I'm in my early 30s or whatever is feasible. I'm a pretty minimal person, I just want to get my career on this track, and I believe the MA would help me stand out.

This is all very vague, but I did this because I want to protect my anonymity. It's been my obsession over the last years that I want more than anything to enter this line of work. Thoughts?"

So yeah. A few qs:

* What do you think of XFX as a PSU brand?

* Is 450W enough if I wanted to add, say, a GTX 670 later? Not OCd.

* Is the RAM decent? It's really cheap so just want to make sure it's good.

* Is AMD coming out with a new APU any time soon? 

* Will Haswell's integrated graphics be better, price-performance wise, than the A10k?

Basically, last year when applying to universities I did not get into any of the universities in my city. Instead I got into a university in another smaller city requiring a 2hr plane ride.

I chose to go to the university in the other city and got very good marks  that when I applied to the universities in my home city, one accepted me so far.   

Now going into my second year I'm stuck with the decision to attend the university requiring the 2hr plane ride or go to the university that's 30mins bus ride from my parents house. 

Some factors I've considered:

* The one that's far away will cost me ~$18,000+/year (due to housing) and other will cost $8,000/year (living with my parents). 

* The far away college has a co-op program which will help me find a job in my field for the summer (cover some of the costs?). However the one close to my parents place has an internship program for 3rd+ years from what I've researched.

* Living on your own is definitely really nice. 

* Maybe I can minor in something when living on my own vs living with my parents/city it's kinda harder and takes more dedication. 


I'm mostly scared about incurring too much debt (but gaining work experience) vs basically getting the same education vs experience from living on your own. 

What is a more sensible decision? Need some advice. Thank you."

The ""real"" jobs are very difficult to get unless you have years of expertise in their special topic, no matter how much education you have. Everything else is part-time or contractor work. And the job listings are soul-crushing.

More often than finding a position I'd like to apply for, I find myself wanting to send angry e-mails to job listers chastising them for their impudence. They want a bachelor's degree and want you to know every style available and only want to pay you $10 an hour (if they're even willing to pay). Or better yet, they want to pay you $10/hour to write four or five 500-word articles a day to fulfill their content-mill needs. If you could even accomplish that, the quality would be so low and the burn-out so high that no one would last more than two weeks. 

At some point, it seems that ""writer"" became synonymous with ""personal assistant"" and ""graphic designer."" It's this uncomfortable catch-all for which no one actually wants to pay. You should be an expert at data-entry, customer service, blogging, social media, PR, articles, reports, graphic design, advertising, SEO, web design, programming, travel arrangements, and finances (oh- and if it's a home office for a small business, expect to walk the dog and pick up groceries). You'll get bumped up to $11-12 an hour if you're really good. If it's part-time, you must be absolutely loyal and work ridiculous hours that make it impossible to hold down multiple jobs. If it's full-time, you should be willing to ""pay your dues"" for a few years and be grateful for your intern wage after a 40-minute commute.

Don't forget that research and ""thinking"" are frowned upon as wasting time. They only want to pay for the finished product.

The easy solution is to just not apply for these jobs. But I know that someone else is just desperate enough to put themselves through it, and I feel defensive on their behalf. These employers have no idea what they want or how much they're squandering what they find. With any luck, they're only able to hire people who don't care.

End rant.

TL;DR  Job searches are frustrating. Low demand, high chance of being taken advantage of. No one cares. Stop whining."

I've been the general manager for 5 years now, and most the employees feel underappreciated and unhappy. My job is to basically run the store as the owners are very out of touch with the daily running of business, and keep the employees sane as the owner generally operates in a separate reality. The owner's wife runs a different shop in the city for a non-profit organization and they use business interns here on work visas from other countries. She's become friendly with the intern coordinator, and the coordinator told her she could have interns at my shop. Which would be great if they were shadowing us and learning! There are so many projects left undone around the shop (when it gets busy we often don't even have enough people running registers on the sales floor due to her wanting payroll costs kept down) but she refuses to pay to have people get stuff done. Her first reaction was literally ""yay, free labor!"" She tells me the interns will be told they are learning english and basic retail skills as she has them run registers and clean the windows, scrub the break room, etc. She also insists that even though the department of labor SPECIFICALLY states that interns can't displace workers, she will be cutting hours for the part time workers who have been at the shop for years and rely on summer hours going up to survive every year. I showed her the L &amp; I guidelines and she said ""well I know the coordinator, she knows what we can fudge a little.""
I have no idea what to do. After talking to the coordinator a bit, it's clear she sees the interns as lucky to be here and gives us full permission to use them for anything. I am 100% against this entire idea. My employees have heard what's in the works (the owners 2 incompetent kids work at the shop and have spread the word) and are becoming agitated. The work environment was already teetering on mutiny, as generally the owners are out of touch, mean, underpaying, and highly demanding. When I mentioned this agitation, the owner's wife said ""if anyone quits, just replace them with an intern. if anyone calls out sick, replace them with an intern. maybe next summer we don't hire, we just bring in interns!""
She is clearly being greedy and I will have to spend a lot of time training these new people during the busiest time of the year (we get between 3-5 thousand customers a day) while my employees look on and wonder where their hours went. The owners refuse to have a store meeting and tell everyone what's happening, they want me to keep it a secret until it happens. 
I've pushed back a little on this and now my job is on the line. Instead of listening to my concerns, the owners are angry at me. I feel bad for my employees and for these interns who are about to get used as janitors. Who can I report this to? Is this legal, and if so, how do I not lose my job for being ethically opposed to this? Sorry for wall of text!"

During the past few months she has applied to many job postings online, but hasn't heard back from any of them. Her GPA is fine, but I suspect the thing holding her back is lack of experience and actuarial exams. She got a 2 on FM and 3 on P. She has worked two internships in her home country before (an insurance company and bank).

She is feeling frustrated about her situation because if she can't find a job she has to eventually leave the US. Because of her lack of confidence in passing actuarial exams, she's started looking for other statistics-related jobs (as yet with no success as well). 

Do you guys think this is a good idea or should she just buckle down and try to pass an actuarial exam as soon as possible to be in a better position for an entry-level actuary job? Any advice/experience is greatly appreciated.

Thanks for the comments all. I've communicated to her your responses and she decided to study this summer for the next upcoming P exam, as well as continue to apply for related jobs (not necessarily as an actuary). Hopefully things work out for her, thanks again!"

She asked me to keep in touch and that if I was open to internships - I told her yes.

How should I keep in touch with the team I interviewed with? Ideally, I'd like to email them maybe once every month or two, and ask if I could add them on LinkedIn. I'm just not sure what the emails should say when I touch base with them."

What do I do?,throwmeaway102,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1f7kp2/any_hope_for_me_22f_and_my_ex_25m_what_do_i_do/,"It feels so terrible to refer to this person I'm in love with as my ""ex"" when just a few months ago we were planning on spending our life together. Here's a summary of what happened: 

We were together for three years, and living together for one of them. When we first met, we were so excited about each other (duh) because we were both just such happy, pure-intentioned, non-needy people. We were both about 5 months out of complicated, manipulative, shitty relationships in which the other person was not in an okay place and took it out on us in ways we didn't deserve. Our ""honeymoon period"" seemed to last about a year; we almost never argued and when we did it was really civil and easily resolved, and did all sorts of fun stuff together. We're both little kids at heart; we love toys and goofy games and dancing like idiots and adventures, and I couldn't even believe someone so exciting existed. I could spend five more paragraphs about how great we are for each other when we're both in a good place, but I'm sure you get the point.

Then, things started to happen in my life that made me stop feeling so carefree and happy. My best friend of 6 or so years and I had a huge misunderstanding turned falling out that ended in an incredibly stressful situation, in which I was stranded in a different city and threatened by her family members. The stress from that situation alone stayed with me, elevating my anxiety levels for months afterward. Plus, I was out a best friend. Shortly after that, my grandma died the day before my boyfriend moved to a different state for four months for a temporary job he'd wanted for years. I'd also just moved from a dorm to an apartment, and I had no car and no job-- just an unpaid internship that was hard to get to in the summer heat with no car. I tried so hard to keep positive through all of this, but I feel like that's when my thought patterns started spiraling downward, hard.

He was always incredibly supportive and kind about all of this; I was so lucky to have someone so compassionate by my side who would do pretty much anything to make me feel better. There were nights when he would blow off plans with new friends to stay in and Skype with me and try so hard to cheer me up. The number of nice things he did for me is ridiculous. He came back and we still had lots of good times together, but I had a harder and harder time staying positive. 

At the time, I wasn't so gloriously self-aware at all. If I had been, I would have gone to talk to a therapist or something, which he actually recommended at one point. But I grew up with parents who thought only crazy people needed help like that, and I was really alarmed by the suggestion at the time.

One of my biggest stressors was school-- I'd always been an honors student who felt like I needed to take as many classes as possible and get straight A's, but here I was living with this person who'd already graduated and had a steady, well-paying job and all sorts of time for hobbies and things he loves. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life; I realized my major was not the one I wanted anymore, but I was too deep into it to affordably change it. Of course, if I could go back now, I would take a deep breath and tell myself not to stress too much, because stuff usually works out. I would use his happiness as an example of how great things can work out. I would be happy for him, and maybe ask him for advice, instead of being envious and expecting his help. And I would absolutely never act scornful towards this person that I love so much for having achieved his goals. But I have no idea where ""I""-- this good-willed, kind person that I know I am-- was at the time. I was lost. I was a tiny dot in the middle of a storm of negative thoughts and bad habits. 

Despite my negativity, we still loved each other tons and felt like we were going to spend our lives together, and we decided to move into an apartment when our lease ended. That summer was great. I only had one thing on my plate-- my job-- and the rest of my time was open to hang out with him and my friends and his friends and our friends and we lived together and made our apartment super exciting to be in, and everything was just so beautiful. 

The next semester, I took an internship opportunity in a different state. We were both really excited for me to go there, but sad to be apart. However, when I got there I had tons of new exciting stuff to do and I made really good friends quickly. I missed him, but it didn't ache nearly as much as I expected. We talked on the phone and Skyped frequently, and instead of being sad about him being gone, I was just excited for whenever I would see him next. However, it wasn't so easy for him-- he was alone in our home and he missed me tons. The sadder he got about me being away, the more I regretted leaving. I started to miss home tremendously, but it came and went. Generally, I was pretty happy. And toward the end of my internship, I started to really settle in-- four months is just long enough to get to know a place so much that you'll miss it. Plus, I realized how much I would miss all the great friends I'd made there, and I became sad about leaving-- too sad. There were the negative patterns in my brain, keeping me from appreciating the present. 

My boyfriend flew in to drive back with me, and I was definitely excited to see him, but I spent way too much time texting internship friends about how much I'd miss them and reflecting on my time away when I should have been enthusiastic about finally getting to go home with the love of my life. We got home and I was so happy to be back, but I just felt weird. I felt like I didn't quite fit in the same anymore; like so much had happened while I was gone and now I wasn't part of the group anymore... or something. I'm sure it was all in my head. I remember being at social events and saying I wished I was back with my internship friends, or leaving the room to talk to them on the phone. I'm disgusted when I think of it now, especially because a the months have made it clear that I'll only stay close with a few of them anyway. 

Needless to say, the last semester was a disaster. I would compare myself to my boyfriend constantly, forgetting the fact that people are like apples and oranges and comparison really makes no sense when we've gone through such different experiences. I wanted to make music so badly, but I felt like I couldn't, since he was so good at it and I would just be embarrassed or something. He would try to help me or suggest we make music together, and I always got self-conscious and retreated. Self-consciousness became a big thing for me; I always felt like I was ""living in his shadow"" or something.

I got really stressed out about stupid stuff-- getting a B instead of an A on a test or having a broken charger on my computer or worrying about finances-- and I took it out on him constantly. I started to do exactly what my dad had done growing up: snapping at everyone around me in times of stress. It was something I hated about my household, and I didn't even realize it, but I was mimicking it, down to my father's gestures. My boyfriend grew up in about the calmest house possible, where people pretty much never yelled, so even the smallest outbursts from me were traumatizing for him. He put it this way: every time we fought it was just a little scratch for me that healed quickly, but for him it was a scratch in the same wound, over and over, getting worse and worse. 

When I wasn't getting unreasonably frustrated, I was down in the dumps and dependent on his comfort to be okay. We would go to shows or parties, and I would hang on him and get mad at him if he was in the other room for too long or something. I was ridiculous. 

One night, we got in a stupid fight about some little thing that wasn't his fault and I said things I didn't mean at all like ""sometimes I hate living here with you"" and he broke up with me. It was really ugly; I was calm at first because I didn't think it could be true and I thought we would work things out and wake up happy the next morning, but as it became more and more apparent that he meant it, I cried and pleaded and begged. He told me to stop, that he just needed to sleep and that I was proving his point, not respecting his wishes and boundaries. He cried a lot too, and he's clearly really sad about us not working out, but he thinks that this is for the best in the long run. 

It's been about a month. I understand exactly why he needed to get away. And part of me is so thankful that something happened to jar me out of my terrible habits. I was really, really unhappy, and I needed some wisdom and perspective. I've been reading a lot about neuroscience and psychology and going to talk to a counselor, finally, and personally, I'm doing much better. But I love him and miss him terribly. He won't even stay in the apartment with me; we've been taking turns staying with friends until we find new living situations. I've expressed to him all of what I'm saying here and more. I've asked him if this can be a break, if we can try again, but he's staunchly opposed to breaks and he says that if things are so bad you need a break, it's not meant to be. But I don't feel like the problem was us; I feel like it was entirely me, like I was unfit to be in any relationship. 

I really want things to work out between us. I really want a life with this person. It's impossible to express in words how much companionship I feel with him, how much fun we have together, how badly I just want to do all of the great things in the world with him, so I'm barely even trying here. But I don't know what to do. We're in contact, but not too much. We talk now and then, but it's usually kind of surface level. The other day I got sick and was at home all day, and we were talking a lot when he got mad all of a sudden and said we were talking too much, and that he's trying really hard to heal and feeling really raw right now and just ""scraping along,"" and that we can't talk as much as we used to because it's confusing and hurtful for him. I was really kind and respectful and apologized right away and didn't force anything, and he apologized for lashing out a few hours later. Since then, he's initiated a few conversations with me, but I just don't know how to act or what to do. Obviously, I wish that he would walk in the door right now and tell me he made a mistake and he wants to be with me and wants to work everything out. But realistically, I know that won't happen and I know that it probably shouldn't happen; I should probably take at least another month to really straighten things out in my own head. But ultimately, I want to be with him, so so badly. I don't care if it takes months. I hope it doesn't take years. I'm just so afraid of taking time for myself and him finding another girlfriend in a few months and being happy with her for a while and then getting married or something. I don't know.

Any advice?

tldr: I was really depressed and unhappy and I took it out on my loving, supportive boyfriend for a long time, all the while getting worse and not getting help like he suggested. Now he broke up with me and I'm finally getting help and doing much better, but I want things to work out between us really badly, and I'm not sure what to do.

I graduated a year ago and have since been dragging my feet through college in the medical field because my mom was so adamant in me being a nurse she's asian and is a nurse herself. I just have been spending the whole year searching my soul not knowing what to do. I had a rough 4 years in high school and just fucked around with my classes. My family had a struggling business and I had to put in alot of work into and we just had to close it down about 4 months ago. Now after being pressured for so long and just feeling worthless in general and watching people and peers from high school I know I am way smarter than just pass me by as sit in slow motion not doing anything with my life. I think I have found what I want to do. I want to work in the video game industry and be a developer of some sorts. I always see people complain about games and not do anything about it I want to actually go out there make games and be a diffrence maker in the industry. I enjoy games and have felt like I would love to work in the industry. This is something I want to put the time and effort into. I am not super gifted like alot of people who made flash games I can't do any of that but am willing to learn. Finnaly I feel like I am sure at what I want to do with my life. I also would loved to get flamed on twitter when I make a god awful game hah. I know this sounds like I am crying but I am fully aware that most of this is my fault. But I would love to hear from you guys some general tips and where to start at to be a game developer and what classes to start with. If there are any internships that will teach me how to do any of those things. I live in seattle there are many game studios here. 343, bungie, valve, and microsoft, nintendo. Any suggestions would help guys. Thank you for your time and remember the person who says they cant and you can if usually right.

1f7jp0,23,2013-05-28,Trying to add a little edge to my wardrobe.,pixelskeleton,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1f7jp0/trying_to_add_a_little_edge_to_my_wardrobe/,"Hey FFA, I am a longtime lurker, first time poster. I am thin, short, blonde and located in the southern United States (Texas) I have a pretty decent wardrobe, lots of casual shirts, jeans, shorts, and sneakers. I've also recently started working at a new internship and I've kind of got more into neutral button-ups, blazers, and flats.

I'm pretty happy with my wardrobe how it is now, but I am really inspired by fit pics like [this](http://imgur.com/a/EH52j) (album), that favor a little bit of edgy flair and/or boyishness.

This seems like kind of a difficult look to pull off and I am relatively new to dressing fashionably, so I was wondering if I could get a little advice from the edgier dressers among you.

Here's some items that I love and I'm thinking about purchasing, but I thought it might be prudent to hold off until after making a thread (I am sorry for linking mostly to F21, I shop there pretty loyally because I am cheap, I like being able to get things for under $50):

[Wedge Sneakers 1](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Product.aspx?BR=f21&amp;Category=shoes_sneakers&amp;ProductID=2030758013&amp;VariantID=) (does this toe look weirdly pointy to you guys?) and [Wedge Sneakers 2](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Product.aspx?BR=f21&amp;Category=shoes_sneakers&amp;ProductID=2040914955&amp;VariantID=) I don't wear heels often at all and I am hoping that these (in addition to looking pretty badass) would be a nice transition into wearing other types of heels more regularly. I'm also pretty worried to order them online incase they turn out to be medieval torture devices.

[Motorcycle Jacket 1](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Product.aspx?BR=f21&amp;Category=outerwear_coats-and-jackets&amp;ProductID=2031805854&amp;VariantID=) (not too sure about the elbow panels on this one) [Motorcycle Jacket 2](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Product.aspx?BR=f21&amp;Category=outerwear_coats-and-jackets&amp;ProductID=2026145233&amp;VariantID=) (or the material on this one) ... any idea where I could find something similar but maybe in a little higher quality for less that $70?

I also like
[these combat boots](http://www.charlotterusse.com/product/Shoes/Boots-Booties/entity/pc/2115/c/0/sc/2653/233316.uts) and [these shorts](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Product.aspx?BR=f21&amp;Category=bottom_shorts&amp;ProductID=2041076480&amp;VariantID=)

I'm sorry I haven't really included any fit pics or anything like that... kind of hard to do whenever I haven't actually bought anything yet. I promise that later on I'll put some fit pics of whatever I get in the 'recent purchases' thread. I guess I'm asking more about how to pull off edgy outfits and about that whole style in general.

Thanks!

1f7iz6,0,2013-05-28,"2 and a half years later, I [23/m] still love her(21/f)...",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1f7iz6/2_and_a_half_years_later_i_23m_still_love_her21f/,"Alright relationship gurus. I'm warning you now, this is going to be a long one. I'm going to have to do a good background in order to make the current advice question make perfect sense.

I'll start at my junior year of high school: There's a girl in my pre-calculus class with blue hair and the most adorable smile I've ever seen in my life. For privacy sake, we'll call her... Kat. I rarely get a chance to talk to Kat, not out of nervousness, I'm not a shy person, never have been, there just isn't enough time in the day while in school, but I do make conversation every once in a while and we seem to get along. One day, a mutual friend (Vicky) brings Kat into the room that my friends and I hang around in before and after school to say hi to everyone. It begins.
Kat is in an ending relationship, she's not happy and comes to me one day for a shoulder to cry on. Of course I oblige, though I know it's not my place to give advice or whatever so I keep my mouth shut. Fast forward a couple of weeks and she's single, so I ask her on a date. She agrees and things go very well, from here on out, we are inseparable. When I say inseparable, I mean my sheer definition of perfect. This girl is everything I could ever ask for out of a girl and more, I have never known happiness like this in my life (even to this day). Our relation ship goes on like this for a year, we do not fight or argue a single time. We have a few short talks of engagement, and other lovey dovey ""we'll be together forever"" stuff. 

We hit late spring of 2008, the end of my senior year of high school and her junior year. Her father (who we are both extremely close to) is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and passes away. Here begins all of the problems. Of course she is absolutely distraught, and I am too, but she looks to me to be her rock so I do my best to be what she needs. The problem is she begins to look at me as a replacement for her father, often making excuses for things like ""daddy would have done it with me"". I cannot be a replacement for a father, and begin to get slightly frustrated. By September/October of 2008, things are shaky, but we seem stable. I'm holding on knowing that daddy issues aren't going to be something that just goes away over the course of a couple of months. I'm still in love with her and always do my best to be everything she needs from me. She gets a job at a supermarket and things get weird. She begins to vocalize her suspicions of me cheating.... which are completely wrong and have absolutely no evidence or support. 

January of 2009: one of her co-workers messages me on Facebook out of the blue, saying that he's glad that Kat and I are ""back together again"" and he hopes there's no hard feelings. Now, this was a shock to me, as I was not aware the Kat and I were ever not together. We have a long conversation and both find out to our dismay that she's been playing both sides. She told him that she had broken up with me for him, and told me that he was just a friend from work. This had been going on for a month and a half. I call her, give her once chance to confess, which she doesn't, and break up with her. We are apart for until the end of July the same year.

Late July 2009: She gets back from a mission trip type thing to Costa Rica and asks me to meet in a park. She wants to talk. I agree (why I don't know). I realize I miss her and we get back together. Things are good for a while. I'm still in community college in the same town, and she's about to move to a university, a two hour drive away. Not too bad I think, we can visit often, it's not far. At this point I'm still blindly in love with her. We work with the long distance for a while. Here's where dates and things get muddy. 

Sometime during winter of 2009: Our relationship starts going sour for multiple reasons. Being away from each other and I still haven't completely forgiven her for cheating the previous year. Things happen and we both end up cheating. I have a one night stand with a co-worker after she gets snowed in at my apartment and we both get drunk. She goes on to have another similar second relationship for a month or two, except this time the guy is completely aware of her being with me. I find out about it and flip my shit. 

Skip forward to September 2010: I move to the same university as her (believe it or not, she had absolutely nothing to do with my decision of that school, it was one of 3 in the state that offered my Major and happened to be the cheapest and closest to home. We're still together at this point, but our relationship is hollow and broken. Neither one of us is happy, neither one of us trusts the other, we're together simply out of jealous lust and an obsession with something that no longer exists. Even though we live only a mile and a half from one another, we never get to see each other. She's an RA on her dorm, and I work 35 hours a week at a restaurant plus school. We spend Christmas back in our home town, and the day after Christmas day she suggests we break up. I'm tired of the relationship and so I agree. We part ways 2 days later. I try my best to get over her by not talking to her, finding other girls to sleep with and generally just trying to push her out of my mind. None of it is working. 

April 2010: She drops out of university. I find out and am upset, but try to laugh it off like I don't care. At this point she's in a relationship with another guy again. I focus all of my energy on school and work as much as I can. Come summer time, I have an internship at a factory for some extra cash and random job experience back in our home town. She calls me one day, our conversation isn't exactly nice, and she ends our talk with this, and this is an exact quote. ""I'm going to go now, but I hope you can be happy for me, I'm going to be engaged soon"". This slams me harder than I've ever felt anything before in my life. I am broken. I have no idea what to do, what to say to anyone or how to go about my life. I spent the next 5 months in a deep depression, finally deciding that the only way to get over her was to hate her. When ever she tried to talk to me from here on our, I swore at her, told her I hate her, and that I never want to talk to her again. She says that she's sorry things worked out this way, but I'll hear nothing of it. She finally gives up. 

I'm going to skip straight ahead to this past weekend now, present time. Her engagement failed early this year and they are no longer together. I have since graduated from university and got a really good career going in another city which just happens to be only 2 hours in the other direction from our home town. I tried to have a relationship with someone else a couple of months ago for the first time since Kat and I broke up, but it was unfulfilled and I broke it off. I have gone 2 and a half years now trying every method I can think of to get over her, and nothing has worked. A friend told me to talk to her over facebook and maybe I'll get some kind of closure. I decided to try it, and she found out that I was going to be in town for the weekend to visit my parents and some other friends. She asked if I would meet her for dinner, to which I said that I was unsure about, but eventually I agreed. 

Saturday: We went to dinner at 7:30, as soon as she pulled up in her car my heart stopped. We spent a good 2 hours at the restaurant talking a lot. We went for a drive up the blue ridge parkway to one of our old favorite spots and ended up sitting in the car and talking in the car until 3am. During the time in the car talking, we held hands almost the whole time, I cried for the first time in 3 years when I told her about how it felt to hear about her getting engaged, we hugged (kinda cuddled a bit I guess) and kissed a few times. It's obvious we haven't got over each other at all. I miss her so much. She has been through some pretty serious shit the last year or so, she got raped, found god and religion and some other stuff too. But most of all, she's grown up and I can tell that she's actually had some life experience now, as opposed to a few years ago. She seems to have dealt with her daddy issues and I honestly believe that she is back to the girl that I remember. The things we shared before were all there in those 12 or so hours that we spent together this weekend. 

Sunday: She asks me when I'm leaving to go home, I say later tonight. She wanted to see me again before I did so I took her to the movies and for dinner again. Once again, we held hands the whole time, did some cuddles and kisses. Her current situation is where some HUGE problems arise. She's going to college there in town for at least another year, as well as working in a store full time. In the last couple months she's signed a lease for the next year with her new best friend, who happens to be in love with her. She tells me that she cares about him, but that she doesn't love him.
So now we're in a strange situation. We have both confessed we miss each other tremendously, and still are in love. I'm uneasy about her living with him, and she's uneasy about telling him that it's going no where because she's with me for the possible awkwardness between them and the distance between us again. 

Reddit... I've never asked for relationship advice before, especially not from the internet. But what should I do. I'm STILL desperately in love with this girl, but our situation seems impossible. I'm lost. 

TL;DR

The love of my life and I broke each others hearts 2 and a half years ago. Met up again this weekend and it's all come flooding back, but in a crazy impossible situation. What on earth should I do. 
I know this thing is a freaking book, but I wouldn't have taken the time to write it all out and put 5 years of my life on the internet if I wasn't in some real trouble here. Please help"

You left me almost 7 months ago now. I'm sure you thought I would break down and become a complete wreck.

I picked up all the valuable pieces left after that destruction of our relationship and I fucking rebuilt. You know what I did in that 7 month time frame, you fucking bitch.

I've lost almost 60lbs of that fat you hated so much and ON top of that I am finally on the road to get that athletic body I've always wanted INCLUDING THAT SIX PACK YOU SAID I COULD NEVER GET.

You always knew I was smart and capable. 
I am going to go places.
I am going to accomplish my dreams. 
I am going to help people to the best of my ability be better people. 
I am going to go on and travel. 
I am going to see the world. I am most importantly going to find somebody who doesn't hold me down like you. 
I am going to find somebody that will increase my happiness, productivity, lifestyle, and world. 


I am going to be alright without you.

You are a pitiful excuse for a lady.
You are a hindrance to yourself and everyone around you.
You are a stupid decision maker.

1f79ch,23,2013-05-28,I've been outed! Need advice on how to handle a complicated family situation. This is long :P,[deleted],exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1f79ch/ive_been_outed_need_advice_on_how_to_handle_a/,"**TL;DR** I'm supposed to give a talk in Sydney about atheism in Malaysia. My whole extended family back in Malaysia now knows about it and about my atheism. My parents are probably furious and will want me, among other things, not to give the talk. They may even force me to return to Malaysia permanently by refusing to pay for my studies. What do I do????  
  



So, further to my post on [bringing shame to my family](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1f69jb/have_you_brought_shame_on_your_family_lately/), there have been some new developments and I need some considered advice on how to handle the situation.

**A bit of background:** I am 31, female, from a muslim family and a muslim country (Malaysia). I've been an atheist for over 10 years. *My parents have known about my lack of belief in god for about 1.5-2 years.* My parents used to be your typical 'relaxed' muslims (fast during ramadan, avoid pork and alcohol, but do not read the quran or pray). However, the past 7 years or so have seen a dramatic 'islamisation' of their way of life, for various reasons. Then 3 years ago, when my paternal grandmother died, their islamism reached new heights. They've been working hard to 'set me straight' but I keep telling them that, whatever i do or don't believe, I am still a good person with principles and integrity and I don't want our relationship to be ruined by constant friction. 


**One year ago**: Last year I decided I could not stand to live in a muslim country anymore and wanted to move away permanently. I informed my parents of this and they, of course, freaked out for various reasons. After a massive quarrel or epic proportions, I came to Sydney, Australia for 3 months on a tourist visa, using my own savings from 5 years of work, hoping to find a full-time job with an employer that would sponsor a working visa for me for at least 3-4 years. However, my job hunt was not successful because employers in Australia generally prefer to hire people who already have visas or permanent residency.


**6 months ago**: I decided that I couldn't give up and applied to take up a Masters course at a university in Sydney. My plan was to network and do internships or part time jobs while I studied so that I could prove myself to potential employers who would then have a more solid reason to hire me and sponsor my visa to stay on in Sydney. I was prepared to use up what was left of my meager savings (Sydney is a m&amp;$^#*#@$g expensive place) to pay for the first semester of tuition and then work my ass off in part time jobs to pay the rest of the tuition fee and cover my living expenses. However, my father took pity on me and offered to pay for my tuition and even cover some of my living expenses. I was incredibly grateful and accepted his offer, with the idea that I would pay him back once I started working full time in Sydney (IF i ever did).

**Present day**: A few weeks back I received an invitation from the Sydney Atheist Society to give a small, 15-minute talk about what life is like for atheists in Malaysia. I accepted. In ways which I shall not go into here, my cousins found out about this. Prior to this, my cousins were NOT aware that I am an atheist and have been for the past 10 years. 

This morning, I received a long, angry, incoherent message from a 20-something male cousin of mine telling me off about bringing shame to the family, etc. I replied politely and firmly, basically telling him to sod off in the nicest way possible.

This evening, I received a text message from my mother saying that my father 'wants to have a talk' with me. No doubt my cousins and aunties and uncles have contacted my parents about my evil ways (of which my parents were already aware anyway) and now my parents are forced to take action against me for the sake of saving face with the family.

You can imagine that I'm not quite sure what to do. Abandon the idea of giving the talk out of respect to my father's wishes (he is, after all, paying for me to be here studying in Sydney)? Maybe. But then what will that accomplish? I would still be a decade-long atheist. 

I could try to be open with my parents about the talk (the talk is not about bashing islam, but is about the social and political structures which affect the daily lives of atheists in Malaysia), but at this stage, with his 'public shaming' among the family for having a sinful atheist daughter, he probably won't listen.

And what if he refuses to fund my education any further? I'd have to start selling my body if I wanted to raise the funds to finish my Masters degree.

Also, I swear I will frikkin kill my bullshit meddling cousins. I would like suggestions on how to go about this. This is very important to me.

Thank you very much.

1f6xyn,43,2013-05-28,Studying abroad for a third semester -- worth an extra few thousand dollars in loans?,cristiline,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1f6xyn/studying_abroad_for_a_third_semester_worth_an/,"I'm 20, currently going to be studying abroad twice. I go to a rather expensive private school, but scholarships, grants, and my generous mother take off most of the load. In my first year, I took out $5,500 in federal loans and in my second year I took out $6,000. A little less than half is subsidized, a little over half is unsubsidized. I haven't gotten the new financial aid package yet, but I was told that since I won't be able to do work study, I'll probably be granted an extra $2,000 in loans (not sure if subsidized or unsubsidized). 

Doing the math, it look like I'll have about $26,000 in student loans when I graduate. My major is modern languages (French and Japanese, with a smidge of Chinese). I don't know what I plan on doing as a career. The next two semesters, I'll be studying abroad in Martinique and Senegal, but I'd like to go to Japan as well because my Japanese is at a much lower level, and I'm afraid if that I won't continue if I'm not so good when I finish school.

I've discussed it with my mom, and she's against it because of the additional costs that go along with study abroad (plane tickets, insurance, miscellaneous expenditures that come from not being close to home, etc). I'm potentially willing to take out a few thousand dollars ($3-4k) in private loans, but I realize it's not the smartest decision financially speaking. In addition to the added costs of the trip, it would also mean I'd definitely stay in school for the full eight semesters. I actually have senior standing and could graduate a semester early if I didn't go to Japan (probably a year early if I cut out Senegal). But... I don't really want to leave school. I'm not sure I would graduate early even if I didn't go because I really love my school (even if the amount of time I want to spend abroad makes it look like the opposite!), and I'd like to graduate with my friends. But admittedly, it would save me $7,000 in loans and ~~$10,000~~ $5,000 of my mom's money.

So, /r/personalfinance, do you think the experience is worth the additional costs? Or should I put Japan on hold?

Edit: Oh, and I guess I should add that I have no other debts. I also don't have a car, though, so that's probably a purchase I'll need to make when I graduate. I do have a credit card that I've been using very regularly for two years and never had a late payment on, so (so far at least!) I've been pretty good at controlling my spending. I have about $1000 right now, and will be doing a paid internship from mid-June to the end of August."

The budget is 50,000 and all of that is going to insurance fees, city fees, and dumpster fee, all of the glamorous L.A. shit that you can't get around once you hit a certain level of respectability.

The good - as far as low-budget, unpaid stuff goes, this is probably the cream of the crop. For the sake of the dignity of the project and the director, I'm not going to go too far into detail on credits, credentials and the team, but they're actually impressive. I'm not going to say ""award winning"" because every moron with a decent short film has at least one ""award,"" I'm not going to say prestigious because that's a buzzword for mediocrity, but-- okay, whatever, it's prestigious and award winning.

So why unpaid? Frankly, it's just not in the budget. Despite the prestige, ostensibly distinguished careers, and award winningness of the production, every one is leveraged to the hilt on this. It's a passion project.

We're looking for an intern for the director. It'll be a thankless job, but you'll get a lot of face time with him. He's got an IMDB page as long as your arm, and you'll get a chance to pick his brain, sit in on meetings, take notes, and talk to the producers, screenwriter, and department heads. He's also super nice. I know that's exactly what a not nice person might say, but you're gonna have to trust me on this.

So what's in for you?
Experience working with a great crew.
A credit on an exciting short film.
Life experience.
The chance to get to learn from an experienced director.
A great line on your resume.

I expect this ad to get flagged quickly, so send resumes asap! For extra credit, write 50 words on why you're perfect for the job."

Its good because they can be healed by medivacs making them very good to mix into Bio centric comps such as MMM and bio-mine.

But it has some bad points about it aswell.

Because they can be healed, hellbat drops are extremely strong and potent.

Because they are biological, Archons do more damage to them, which intern is a nerf to mech play.

There is seemly more negative side effects from making hellbats biological, and the only postive is for Bio based plays.

Is getting a job post graduation as difficult as getting an internship? Further, given my poor internship experiences should I stop expecting that I'll be able to get a job 6 months after graduation?"

We had been dating for 1.5 years and I thought everything was perfect. We lived about an hour away from each other, but we would alternate making the trip every single weekend to see each other. We talked about how we ""knew"" that we had found ""the one"" with each other. I was her first time. Both of our lives were going great, I had an internship set up and she had been accepted to med school, all in the same city.

This summer was supposed to be our first time living in the same city while dating.
Then the past few weeks she had been avoiding me, saying she was busy with all of her friends who were graduating. She's been super sick, and had such a bad cough that she dislocated a rib. I figured she needed some time to rest.

Yesterday, she finally asked if I had a few minutes to see her. At least I had some sort of hint it was coming. We drove to a park. She started crying before she said a word. She told me she thinks we should break up. She told me that it didn't feel right. I have no idea what that means and I just keep wondering what I did wrong.

This is the worst feeling I've ever had in my life. It's been over 24 hours now since she broke up with me, and I haven't eaten, haven't been able to sleep. I keep telling myself that she just hasn't been feeling well, that she doesn't know what she was doing. Maybe she just wants to meet a doctor at med school instead. I guess it doesn't really matter now.
I was supposed to get to see her every day this summer. She was moving in 5 minutes away from where I'm living. Now I won't see her at all. It's taken all of my will power to not text her and ask if there's someone else. I don't think I could handle it if she said yes anyways.
And I can't even be mad at her. She's always been honest with me, any time we had an argument we were always respectful of each other and never said anything we'd regret or use mean words. I just want to be mad at her but I can't, I'm just so fucking sad. 

As if I wasn't tormented enough, at the end of it she said ""Maybe we can see where we're at at the end of the summer."" What the hell does that mean? If she's done with me, I need to stay completely clear of her to begin the healing process. But if there's any hope then I would do anything. 

She starts med school tomorrow and knowing that I won't be able to ask her how her first day went makes me sick. 



EDIT 6/2/13: I've decided to add an update to this post at the end of each week, until I feel like I don't need it anymore. My phase of not being able to eat or sleep only lasted two days, and my appetite has slowly been returning ever since. I started lifting again for the first time in two years which I think has helped a lot with both my physical and mental health. 

It feels like there's no rhyme or reason to how I feel each day. Some days I feel fine, and am thankful to be busy at work which keeps me distracted. Some days I won't be able to get anything done because all I do is think about what I would say if I saw her and just feel too sad to do anything. I was able to go out with my friends the past two nights. I'd be lost if I didn't have some of the most supportive friends I could ask for. They've been trying to get me to talk to new girls at the bars, but it honestly just feels like I'm being disloyal to my ex. Which I know doesn't make any sense, I was dumped, but I can't help it.

On Wednesday, I stumbled on the Christmas card she wrote me from last year. I shouldn't have read it, but I did. I think that may have been the lowest point I've hit since this whole thing happened. We were both so happy. In her card, she thanked me for being so supportive of her while she was applying to med school. She said she wouldn't have been able to do it without me. Now that she's in, it feels like I just wasn't needed anymore. She wants to start a new phase of her life and doesn't want me to be a part of it. 

Tomorrow night, one of my best friends and roommate is having a shared 21st birthday party with one of my ex's best friends. I'm terrified of seeing her there. Sometimes I get excited at  thinking about getting to talk to her. Then I feel like I shouldn't say anything at all. I've been successful at no contact so far but I don't know what's going to happen if she's there tomorrow. All I know is that I'm not going to miss my friend's 21st because of her. "
1f6k7l,0,2013-05-28,Help! Drug Test Concern,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1f6k7l/help_drug_test_concern/,"Hello people,
Im a college student who is about to begin a paid internship in CA on the 3rd of June. I dont know why I was so stupid, but since my last internship didnt drug test I just never considered the fact that this one probably would. Anyway I was filling out some paperwork a few days ago and signed something with their payroll agency about background checks and drug tests. My first question is was I just signing and filling out some typical forms that are meant for long term employees and they just re-used them for interns. Let me rephrase that: does their ""can require a drug test and background check"" mean they will 100% drug test their interns. Also I've already accepted the internship, will they test me on my first day or tell me to get tested within the first week?

Assuming the answer is yes, I have a problem. I was a heavy smoker (multiple time a day) while at school last month. Since the summer has began (three weeks ago) Ive smoked on occasion about twice or once  a week. I have not smoked since last Thursday (23rd), once I learned of the potential drug test. Since then I have intensely exercised daily and drank a lot of fluids. Do any California companies use blood or hair tests? that would be so fucked up. If it is just a urine test what are the chances i pass assuming I would have 12-16 days of sobriety behind me? I plan on trying some home detox remedies and continuing to exercise and chug fluid until then.

~~EDIT: I forgot to mention I am 5'11, 145 pounds (pretty darn skinny), and have an EXTREMELY fast metabolism. I think this factors into the retention of THC in your fat

Can't really remember anything untill my 3rd birthday starting in kindergarden (Brought waffles and ice cream).

It was a fairly small place which focused a lot on being outdoors.

That's where i met Mark, my first real friend.
We'd play together every day, we we're like brothers.

Fast forward three years to school start, it was so-so meeting all these new kids, largest school in the city.

At the end of the first year I find out Mark is moving, not far but still a bus ride away, really sucked.

I can't remember first and second grade, except a girl. Nicoline. We were really close friends, not in any sort of ""romantic"" way, just friends.

I remember my grandmother (Only grand parent i ever knew) die... I can't remember then, how old she was, how old i was, her voice but i remember her tiny apartment.


(First break to cry for me)

Before she died my parents split up, I remember sitting on my dads lap as they told me and my sister,

Then Nicoline had to move, i was pretty much alone, had one or two friends where i lived.

I cant remember when but we moved into an apartment owned by the hospital where my mom lived, dad slept on the couch.

Then things got bad, i started to feel ill, didnt go to school, cant remember how long. Sometimes I'd go with my mom to the hospital and while she worked i'd play RuneScape, pretty much tought me english.

Then my mom started seeing this doctor, never liked him.
Made us move 40 km away, like 50 minutes on bus.

Went to school one day, never returned.

Me and my mom had fun staying home together, we didnt do much.

Suddenly on a mini vacation my mom informed me and my sister our aunt was found dead. I loved her, we used to stay up and play Goldeneye 64. ""What's up Freddy spaghetti"".

Then disaster, the doctor hit my mom, yes a punch, that bastard.
My dad pulled me, my sister and my mom onto a mini cruise to Oslo, sorta fun.

When we got back Doctor douche acted like nothing had happened, scared me forever.

Some time later my sister, my mom, his idiotic kids and I were going out to play football, when i accidently shut the door making doctor douche furious, trying to hit me my mom intervened and stopped him. She got hit, i cried for hours, i couldent protect my mom, i must have been around 11.

We moved into a house for others like us, still talking to my dad often. I was sitting in the basement of the centre playing a dancing game for the PS2, The boys are back in town again by Thin Lizzy was playing, my mom told me we were moving back close to my friends, i was excited.

We moved, with dad, into a tiny apartment owned by a vet. Mom and dad got back to together, still didnt go to school.

We moved a bit closer into a rented house, this is where i start to remember things again.

My dad worked for a company that would sell and deliver building supplies as a truck driver.
I would ride shotgun, was so much fun.

Then we moved into an apartment in the city where i used to live, we found (Mostly my mom) a special needs school for kids with Asperger and such.

First year i saw other boys play Counter-Strike, i joined in and fun was had, i got hooked.

Took I.T classes, met one of my best friends, Jokke, he knew Mark and they were close friends.

Second year were with a bunch of people i dont really like, got a paper route (Fuck that)

Third year was great, me, Jokke and another very good friend, Jonas, were in the same class.
But my mom and dad seperated again, dad moving in across the street.

After a while we couldent afford electricity, lived without it.

Met a girl in my class, in December i visited her (Institution) and i lost my virginity to her. Now that i think about it i was her first after a rape.

Meanwhile my mom met a new guy that lived far away (Atleast 2 hours each way).
We spent the christmas there, we watched a Narnia movie in the cinema when i got a text saying my girlfriend and i had broke up.

In Denmark we celebrate christmas the 24.th, but the 25th. was the best day in my life, i was playing MineCraft Classic when i meet two people, one of them a girl.

We exchanged FaceBook info and went on with our lifes.

We got back to to my dad's apartment (Mom couldent afford one), still no electricity.

It was only the last quarter of the year, after a class ski trip (Was fun untill i fell on a board, classmate nearly broke my arm on accident and Jokke fell and blacked out crushing some ribs) that we started to study for our exams

I got nerveous and my grades got shitty.
Except science though i never really cared.

By this time me and the Minecraft girl (Let's call her Bay) talked everyday, we were good friends.

Mom told sister and i we would move to her Boyfriend.
Oh no...
I'd miss Jokke and Jonas.

We moved, no school, cammed with Bay everyday, yay.

In around October i started frequent 4chan.

I started playing TF2.

Started in a production school, I.T course, was stupid.
Had a weeks internship in the airforce in week 6, was cold.
Left soon.

Dad had a breakdown, went to a psychward.
Dad moved to our city, yay.

My dad and I spent hours playing GT5 on the PS3, super fun.

Me and my stepsister had a waterfight one night, water hit my laptop, ruined it, keyboard ruined.

Had to stop playing TF2 on my laptop, could still use my stepdads for it, met some great friends.

Fast forward to October.

Still talking to Bay. Super great.
Stepsister said i couldent get to do her friend, i did.

In November i talked to my stepsisters friend a lot, she loved me.

I ended it with her, after having sex with her under a staircase, douche move.

Told Bay i love her, apparantly she loved me too.

We Skype everyday.

I cut her name into my thigh. Didnt really hurt.

We talk about me moving to England in january (Imma do it)

I kinda stopped eating, nearly passed out, still gotta take an EKG.

And here we are, me and Bay have been together for 6 mons and i nearly fucked it all up because im a cuntbag.

I hate myself

(Any questions welcome)

1f6c4o,1,2013-05-27,It's the end of the school year and I've set myself up for failure.,thrownaway0-,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1f6c4o/its_the_end_of_the_school_year_and_ive_set_myself/,"I'm 16, a rising senior in high school, and as the school year comes to a close the downward spiral I've gotten caught in is starting to really get to me. This is pretty much the end and there's nothing I can do about it. I've been fully aware of my descent into a state that I never would have expected I'd find myself in. 

From an outside perspective, I would be tempted to say that it's just the stress of final exams that's getting to me and making me react this melodramatically. But it's not. I truly have let myself become become lazy, avoidant, and defeatist, and it makes me incredibly ashamed of myself because there's no excuse.

So, let's see... 
Despite some struggles, I've always been able to maintain good grades, i.e., an A/B average. I have two Fs and two low Cs this quarter and and they're not exactly on track to improve in the next week and a half. Last quarter I was doing comparatively better but not phenomenally. 

I have a final essay due in under two hours that I haven't started on. I have a project due tomorrow that I have no more than glanced at.
I have a different (group) project due tomorrow that I haven't contributed to yet, and my group members have been reminding me of it all weekend. I haven't responded. 

I'm not entirely confident that I will complete any of the three tonight.

The thing is, this isn't new. I have allowed myself to neglect studying for an in-class assessment or skip out on turning in an assignment multiple times in the past weeks, which isn't characteristic of me at all. 
I have so much less motivation to do these things but I still feel just as guilty about it. 

After sticking with a group of friends that I connect with for way too long because I didn't have the confidence or know-how to find anyone else, but finally I broke away from them (naïvely believing I'd be able to find someone else.. nope). That was a while ago, and I've noticed that as I inconspicuously drew away, I became increasingly apathetic. Now they decide to include me in this summer trip they're taking right after school ends and I accept their offer because even though it's going to be awkward due to the fact that I'm no longer a part of their social group, I have nothing else to do. Maybe I'll learn something from it.

It really bothers me that I can't make friends. 

I deleted my Facebook. I sit alone at lunch. I've established myself as an absolute nobody. I waste the majority of my time worrying about stuff but never doing anything about it. I don't have a good relationship with my parents - they ask what's wrong with me and leave it at that. I won't venture any further into my past because by this point I'm sure you're tired of reading this. 

May I touch upon one more topic before we're through? 

I'm so worried about this summer. To preface this, another mannerism I've developed is the tendency to let things accumulate, like books I want to read and movies and music and ideas for my art and thoughts I want to expand upon in writing and and subjects I want to learn about and places I want to explore. My OneTab Google Chrome extension is a pretty accurate metaphor for what happens after the initial discovery and decision to pursue something at a later date: 133 other pages waiting for me, and there's very little chance that I'll do anything about any of them. 
I've passed up [all of the] countless opportunities to apply for an internship or some sort of work over the summer that would provide some degree of additional help getting into college that I'll so desperately need. I let them accumulate and told myself I'd look at them later and it's way too late now. I have something in mind that I'm already passionate about but I don't deserve to be a part of something so important. Regardless, it's too late. 

I could have gotten into governor's school, for example, but it's too late. 

I now do terrible, self-destructive things like habitually overeat and pick at my face everyday in a vain attempt to 'deal' with my acne which probably wouldn't even exist if it weren't for this disgusting development of mine. 

I don't want to turn seventeen, ever. I don't want to bother anyone around me by expressing all of this. Nothing is acceptable about what I'm letting myself do, especially because I've convinced myself that I'm capable of much better, but here I am. And finally, I'm willing to pay you five dollars in exchange for a hug. Mostly serious.

Sorry about the novel. 

**TL;DR**, For some reason I've consciously allowed myself to become a useless human being and the internalization that this is going to affect me in the future is hitting me hard. Feeling sorry for myself is stupid and makes me feel even worse but I don't know what else to do at this point. "

I'll just give you a brief intro so that you know what you're dealing with.  I'm a 22 year old guy, english is my third language pardon me if I can't express myself sometimes -- i'm a complete beginner to the whole tech side of computers.  Even though all i've been doing the past 10 years is gaming on the PC, whenever I had technical trouble with like bluescreens or viruses/malware that kind of thing(when I was younger) my brother fixed it for me.  He works at a PC repair shop(also selling pc's and accessories and that) since like a decade and had always been there for me when I was having problems with my computer, upgrading and stuff too, so I really never felt the need to educate myself on the topic or try something myself. After I finally finished highschool back when I was 18, which was a horrible time since I was very antisocial because I had been going through an extremely rough time at home(my grandparents and dad died in the same year).  I had absolutely no motivation to carry on with studying, unlike everybody else who was very hyped to go to university or work.  I dabbled around in law school for a year, then I spent a year at home, then I tried tourism studies, nothing was really for me.  I was/am very lazy and would make up excuses to just sit here at the PC so that I can play games or watch movies.  Now at 22, I finally decided to get my act together and go look for a job, without luck(bad situation in my country).  Then today, my brother came back from work with a very happy expression on his face -- I could get an internship at his work for 3 months (he's not just a bottom employee, above him is only one more boss).  My brother and I never really connected much and we hardly ever spoke despite him living in the same house all this time (he's 40 now, suffering from periods of depression), yet this was really great news.  

Now finally to my question, do you think it's possible for me to learn sufficient information about the whole PC tech world in 2 weeks so that I don't make a complete fool of myself when I start my internship there? I'm quite clumsy and awkward at times so it'll be weird anyway but i'd absolutely LOVE to atleast have a little basic knowledge on this subject beforehand.  I just wanted to ask here first before I start googling books etc. because I don't want to end up with outdated information or beginning at the wrong place etc. Basically i'd really like to learn the basics of how to build a PC, i've been looking at videos such as these from thenewboston http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7uBoOA11Pw&amp;fmt=18, and considered downloading one of those ""for dummies"" books about building computers.

Could somebody please help me out? Where should I start and how? What are the most important things I need to learn properly? It would mean the world to me, I feel like I can finally turn my life around and do something. "

My new job is awful, it's extremely stressful and the environment is toxic, and after I come home from a long day all I can do is hate myself for choosing this path. I need this experience to get a good job to pay off my loans and help my family with money, but I feel like I'm sacrificing my well being.

I don't know anyone here from beyond who I've met at work or my elderly neighbors, and I feel distant from everyone back home. I'm drowning, and all I can do is go to work for 12 hours a day with a fake smile, come home and feel guilty because I've neglected my dog."

1favqm,1,2013-05-29,[Internship] Web programming internship available for the summer,[deleted],internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/1favqm/internship_web_programming_internship_available/,"Hello everyone, I am offering a unique opportunity in web programming. I am a software engineer for my primary business but I am also starting a project on the side. I am looking for interns who want to learn programming or bring their programming skills to the next level this summer. The assignments I can provide can have a wide range in difficulty so this posting applies to anyone who has completed at least freshman year in computer science.

**What you can learn**

* C# / ASP.NET MVC
* Javascript
* AngularJS
* MongoDb
* Neo4j
* Solr
* Twitter Bootstrap UI Framework
* Git / Github

The internship is, however, unpaid. But I have laid out a plan to be in accordance with all points on the sidebar.

* Work from home / remotely
* Work as many or as little hours as you choose. This is your own education after all.
* We will have regular, live Skype code reviews and training sessions
* Over the course of the summer, you will be given a series of assignments that will get progressively more difficult and challenging as you get more familiar with the technology that you are working with.

For example, your first assignment will be to watch a tutorial on angularjs. Next assignment is to write a little application in angular and c# / asp.net mvc. Next assignment is to hook it up to a database, etc, etc...

I hold no expectations as to the quality of the work. I understand you are an intern and I will likely scrap all of your code anyway. All I ask is that you are intrinsically motivated and sincerely care about learning. The more you work and put in, the more I will help and teach you. At the end of the summer, I will write you a letter of recommendation and serve as a reference for you. And you can put everything you've done down on your resume.

If you are interested, please PM me with:

1) What school you are attending / major

2) How much school you have completed

3) Programming languages you are familiar with

4) One sentence on why you are interested in this internship. 
 

Cheers."

My dad is a cop and my mom a secretary.  I was raised to work hard and get good grades.  I graduated college with a 3.0 gpa and a degree in aviation management with flight.  I have over 250 flight hours but recently started to pursue a job in the ground and not on the air because of all the furloughed pilots and the low rate of pay.  I have been working old end jobs that don't pay over $13 an hour and half the time I don't get enough hours.  I applied to over 100 jobs in the last 4 months that offer benefits and salary pay.  I have been declined from all of those plus internships.  My bosses think I'm one of the best workers they ever had and I usually transform their businesses for the better.  I got laid off from 3 jobs in 2012 because business was slow.  I now work in data entry and at Oheka Castle doing a little bit of everything, catering, security, valet.  My parents think I have no motivation because I get up at 930am and work only 40 hours a week.  They start fights with me about not saving enough, not contributing more than 40hours a week to work, and eating too much taco bell.  I weigh 140lbs and I think the more I eat the better.  But my parents want me to save money and eat at home but all they buy me it's goldfish, hot pockets, and poptarts.  They are now threatening to make me move out unless I continually apply daily to to these jobs that my resume seems to just get shredded or they just sell my information to telemarketers.  Is this a little strict? People above me on the business ladder still can't find work, how am I suppose too...  sorry this might be a rant because my parents just egged me again about not acting my age by not working 24/7.  Please tell me your story."

(Read description),[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1faqwx/help_is_this_guy_into_me_read_description/,"So I have met this guy few years ago at College. We only had one class together and had to be in the same group for a school work so we had quite few conversations before. We have mutual friends but we didn't get along til my used to be so close galfriend dated one of his bestfriends. Things happened and we hanged out within a group of friends. One day, me and my galfriend invited him along with his bestbuds to do an intern job (for College graduating students) with us in this particular company. We got so close and then he acted really strange. He'd usually come to me at work and check if i'm doing okay. He has hit on me a lot of times like giving pick up lines and calling me 'sexy' jokingly. Last night, I posted a status on facebook that I am sick. He immediately messaged me and asked if im doing okay. I was like 'why are you concerned?' in a sarcastic manner. He was like 'huh? who is concerned?' Then our conversation went on and he jokingly said 'if you were a good girl ive already loved you!'  I was like 'okay?' 0.o

I honestly don't want to get with him because he already has a child with his ex gf. It's a big deal breaker for me. He also dated one  of my galfriends but they didn't last long because  the mother of his child (ex gf) bullied and mocked my galfriend. Plus he smokes cigarettes a lot and I hate people who are like that. He is fine looking but maybe if he had took care of himself I wouldn't feel like this towards him. I really don't want to fall for him. I like someone else (he lives far from me and seem to giving me a cold shoulder). I dont want to get distracted with this guy just because he gives me special attention.

First question: Is this guy into me? 

Second question: How can I avoid him in a nice way?"

I won't waste my time explaining her to you guys but wow she is gorgeous. Of course I'm fucking awkward so I don't say much even when she tries to make conversation, I just don't know what to say.
This is a common occurrence with me, I always see an attractive girl and just clam up, even if I know they're single, figuring I'm just wasting my time. In this case I'm sure she has a boyfriend, there's no way someone as good looking and as smart as her wouldn't be (she said she's working on her masters).
I just feel so average, like she's way out of my league, I don't even want to say anything because it would make my appointments awkward after getting stonewalled.

I think it's absolutely ridiculousness, especially considering the student loan/debt crisis, to expect students to work anymore than five hours a week at any job/research/internship unpaid.  The only people who could afford to do such things are those who come from wealthy families, therefore creating a sort of positive feedback loop (wealthy families have their children do internships, internships let children get good jobs, children become wealthy).

- *November 2012 - March 2013* Worked a series of part time low wage jobs while trying to find work that would be flexible with my surgery in April and my inability to carry objects / walk long distance. No luck.
- *April 2013* Had ankle surgery finally. Started a $13/hour internship (ugh) at a regional planning non-profit, enrolled in graduate school this fall (environmental engineering)

I am basically just trying to get by. My resume is great - I have ample experience, several internships under my belt, and I am a very resiliant guy. I was in Peace Corps Liberia eating dirt and pooping in a hole. I have a chemical engineering degree and I am a smart guy.

So that's the background: Here's the question.

I am hoping to find a full-time job with big-boy pay still. I won't be able to walk without crutches until July. But! I found an opening at an environmental consulting group which has hired people with far less experience than me (one of them being my friend). I enthusiasticly applied on their website, on my college's alumni job board, cold-emailed some HR folks... no response. 

My friend forwarded my resume, chatted with me online, and said

&gt;Hi FriendlyTrashMan, it turns out ____ office will interview candidates on June 4th. My manager mentioned they will try to schedule you interview on the same day if possible. Just want to give you a heads up. Best of luck!

I haven't heard anything back yet - June 4th is less than a week away. I really want to talk to someone there and ask about it.

Do I call them? Email someone from their website? Just wait by my phone impatiently? I would drop my internship (which pays less and is not in my area of interest - but is 100% better than no job or a call center, as far as my resume is concerned) and take evening classes at grad school if I could. Job in my field + 2X pay &gt; what I am doing. I really want this job. It feels within reach. If I can get that interview, I am confident I can get that job.

Any advice on where to go from here? Should I just keep waiting - I have only been at my new job for not-even two months. I put it on my resume so that it didn't look like I was slacking for 8 months. 

The lack of contact after reaching out to them in 5 different ways is killing me!"

I was hoping to receive advice on how to not completely screw over my future, specifically in paying off my student debts and being able to transition to an independent lifestyle.

I'm attending a private institution thanks to a generous scholarship, and I estimate that I will have about $24k in loans by the end of four years. I'm comfortable taking out this amount because the student debt I would incur at the alternative, my state's flagship university, is around the same amount. 

Although my parents will assist in paying off my loans, I wanted to contribute, and I've started saving my money to put a dent in those loans. I currently have $1,150 in savings for that purpose. 

My plan is to work on-campus throughout college and continually put most of my income toward those savings, using summers either to take more classes, work full-time, or (most importantly) internships. 

Does /r/personalfinance have any advice on how else I can work toward paying off those loans quickly, or making it through college in general? I've thought of investing some of those savings as I don't plan on touching it at all for four years; is P2P lending such as Prosper a viable option? Should I wait until I accumulate more money then lock it up in a CD?

Edit for additional information: Once I have a steady source of income, through an on-campus job or whatever else, I planned on getting my credit union's Young Adult credit card so I could start building credit as well. "

I kind of felt like this girl was into me, but I also assumed she moved out of town for her summer internship, so I stopped thinking about it. 

Well, the other night at the bar, I see her come in with a dude. It was so perfect, as I was chilling at the bar with another HB 8.5-9 and her HB 6.5-7 friend. I go up and talk to the girl &amp; the dude, introduce myself to the dude, and kino once on her arm to let her know the deal. Then, I eventually left with the girls I was with. 

The next morning, I was kicking myself for not hitting on this girl/getting her number, so I said fuck it--I'm going to go for a fucking gay ass facebook number close. It's all I knew to do, because there's no telling where I'd see this girl again. So I messaged her something short and sweet telling her that ""we should hang"" out asking her number, telling her I'd call her (KEY = CALL GIRLS, and tell them your going to call them). I immediately regretted it &amp; assumed she would think I was a fucking chump. BUT, she messaged me back telling me ""we should definitely hang out!"", she gave me her number, BUT, that she was moving cities for the summer the very next morning. BAD FUCKING TIMING YO!! I called her the next day telling her to holla at me if she's in my city &amp; I'd holler at her if I was in her's--basically I just wanted to make contact outside of facebook and I wanted her to know my number.

Also, thoughts on this situation?? I think this girl is interested in me. We go to a small school together, so I know we'll see each other in two months again. But I'm wondering whether I should try to communicate with her throughout the summer, or whether I should just leave it alone until school starts back, then, game her from there? I'm thinking just waiting to game her in person is the way to go? Thoughts?"

I am changing careers and currently enrolled in a CCNA associates degree program. An internship just opened up on the Windows Server team at a very large corporation nearby. I know four of the guys that work on said team. This would be the perfect opportunity to get my foot in the door.

**The Problem**

One of the requirements is that I must be working towards a bachelor's degree. My plan was to finish out this next term in the associates program so that I could get hands on Cisco experience, and then transfer to WGU for their bachelor's degree. Every class I take next term will count towards that bachelor's degree. Including the Windows Server and Active Directory course.

**The Question**

So how can I spin this so that I can get this internship? I assume my cover letter is the best spot to do this but I am unsure of how to approach it."

First of all, I just want to say thanks to all that make this a great subreddit. I find articles and discussions that I would not run across otherwise and they are always interesting to read.

I am currently at a state university in the United States studying higher education. I am scheduled to graduate in the spring of 2014 with a Master of Arts in Higher Education Administration. I have a graduate assistantship at the university where I am a student.


My main interests when it comes to careers in higher education are in institutional research and financial aid. As an undergraduate, I fell in love with research and I feel that if I were to work in IR I would be doing something I love. A job has just opened as an IR analyst at the university where I am a student and I am torn as to whether I should apply. On one hand, it is an opportunity at an institution where I would love to work and it is a good entry-level job in IR. Further, I want to stay in this city and I am not sure if there will be any opportunities available in IR when I graduate (the other offices at institutions in this city are small). On the other hand, I would have to leave the office for which I work as a graduate assistant (my supervisor said that he would not prefer that I leave but would support me if I chose to do so) and I would still have to go to school while having a full-time job. I am scheduled to graduate if I take 9 hours in the fall (3 classes) and 6 hours in the spring (2 classes, one being associated with an internship that requires 150 hours of work for the semester). Needless to say, it would be a tough year but I am confident that I would be able to attend graduate school full-time and work a full-time job.

Do you all have any advice for me or know anyone that has been in a similar situation (i.e., full-time grad school and full-time job)? Thank you very much."

I was long term unemployed (worked in the family business, but it was very undemanding, just some traveling a few days a month) until last year when we shut the business. I was based in Athens at the time, and finding a job was pretty much out of the question.

Due to being fluent in 3 languages I was offered a job in the UK doing tech support. I also have a degree in Communications from a US university, and some experience working in TV production (an internship 10 years ago, and an AP credit on a TV show that never ended up airing)

I am now coming up on a year working at the call center, but want to move on from that. I also don't want to start moving from one call center to another.

My question is should I go back and study again? I am thinking of getting some sort of accreditation in Avid (I enjoy editing) or just doing a degree in film.

I’m broke, with a nearly useless BA in Music Education, and stuck in a soul-sucking 9-5 sales job. I’ve read enough advice posts here to convince me that film school might not be the best course of action (which is fine, since I can afford it anyway). I’d love to find someone to apprentice, but I can’t afford to quit my job and feed myself while to do that. And even if I could, I have no idea how to find such a person. I’m in St Louis, which does have a burgeoning film community, but it’s still small. Are there other options that I don’t know about? Maybe paid internships or something? Maybe even TV or Radio studios might have something, but what do even I ask for?

My endgame doesn’t include delusions of being some huge big-shot LA sound designer. I just want to develop a skill-set and experience base in something I enjoy that I can use to feed myself and keep a roof over my head. (Because right now, the only things I’m qualified for are things I despise.)

1fa1aa,152,2013-05-29,He figured it out himself,DarkJjay,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fa1aa/he_figured_it_out_himself/,"I'd like to preface my story by saying that, while some parts might be embellished for the sake of storytelling, this story is absolutely true. 

As few of you might know, I'm a Dutch student and I'm currently learning how to be an English teacher. I love teaching with all my heart, but you sometimes notice that some of your students are just genuinely fucked. Up. This story happened at one of my internships, and it is by far the most fucked up thing I've been a part of. I'll get to the meat of the story later, but first some background. 

I've had an interest in Autism Spectrum Disorders (or ASD, as I'll call them from this point on) because one of my ex girlfriends has Aspergers. It still boggles my mind that, even though we're technically the same species, their brains function on a completely different level. I started researching ASDs because I started noticing that I just genuinely did not understand my ex. I later started an internship at a school specialised in helping students with an ASD get their high school diploma. My fascination got me to this point, which got me to meet Frank (not his real name). 

Frank was one of my students, and he was a clever one. One of the things I learned was that people who have an ASD can find it hard to focus on things they don't find interesting but that once they find something they find interesting, they get OBSESSED with it. Frank found learning new things to be THE single most important thing on the entire planet, to the point where he would not eat, shower, sleep or go to the bathroom while he was figuring things out. A famous example was when Frank pissed himself while he was trying to figure out a math problem. He was 16 at the time. Frank loved to learn English (I live and teach in Holland, learning English is mandatory here), which means that he quickly clung to me because I could teach him new things. He always showed up with either some kind of story or movie he'd seen and he'd ask me questions on things like symbolism and story structure. I loved to talk about it at first, but when he started to take up too much of my lesson time I started encouraging him to try to figure things out himself. This did not go well at first because he'd throw tantrums if he didn't understand something (this is why he would keep going when he was figuring stuff out. He simply could not stand not knowing something), but he quickly figured out that going right to the source of things often helped him get the quickest and cleanest answer. I encouraged him to do research and find interviews and such, seeing as he was getting both more independent and developing his primary skills. I was elated to see him blossom and develop. This is where the story gets going. 

Nearing the end of the year, I noticed that Frank hadn't shown up to class. I didn't think too much of it at first, but I made a note of it so I could ask the janitor what happened (seeing as he processes the absentees). He told me I should talk to the director, who told me the following story.

Two nights ago, Frank was up all night working on his Biology homework. They were looking at organs during class (the intestines, specifically) and he was hung up on the difference between the smaller and larger intestines. His parents were woken up by his younger sister's screaming, and they saw Frank stand over her with a bloodied knife. It turns out that cutting open the cat and looking at it's intestines didn't provide him with the answer he needed, so he decided to look at the source, just like I taught him. He was put into an institution (no padded cells or anything, just intense therapy) and I didn't see Frank for the rest of the year. 

When his parents asked him why, he just said he wanted to ""figure it out himself"". 

(The edits are minor touch-ups to some sentences that weren't clear. I did not change any story elements)"
1fa171,2,2013-05-29,Statistical Study of Most Effective 6v6 Team Class Arrangements,[deleted],truetf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1fa171/statistical_study_of_most_effective_6v6_team/,"Oi,

I'm a High-School aged kid who has a profound interest in the applied science of Statistics.  And, no shit, I love TF2 as well, since I'm here right now.  I've taken a large interest in amateur and professional 6v6 gaming in competitive TF2 -- there's a lot more class-based strategy when there aren't one-per-class limits.  I.e, you could have:

* Aggressive Scout

* Frontline Medic

* Primary Pocket Heavy

* Secondary Pocket Demo

* Tertiary Pocket Soldier

* Spy

For an overall aggressive team.  On the other hand:

* Backline Engineer

* Support Medic

* Sniper

* Backline Support Engineer

* Roaming Pyro

* Demoman

For a staunchly defensive tactic.

Of course, these are two extremes.

There are millions of combinations -- especially when strategies are considered.  A ""frontline pocket soldier"" and a ""frontline pocket demo"" share more attributes in terms of strategy and game flow with each other than a ""frontline pocket soldier"" and a ""backline roaming solider"", even though the latter comparison is between two of the same class.  Those ""backline"", ""frontline"", ""pocket"", etc. adjectives are essentially as important an implication strategy as the class itself, as you all most likely know from experience, whether you've played 6v6 or not.  In 6v6 however, a single weak link in the strategy can ruin a whole set of rounds.  Some example class adjectives:

* Frontline -- Player will play at the front line of action

* Pocket -- Player will be healed and Uber'd by a Medic

* Support -- For engineers, they help another engineer build their buildings before building their own -- good for pregame.  For medics, it means a medic that doesn't have a single pocket, but goes around and heals/Ubers more randomly based on situation without obligation to a single player.  

&gt; So, what's the point of all of this?

I'm going to do a study (of sorts) using statistically sound methods to determine what types of class arrangements are best suited to fight against other arrangements.  

&gt; How is this useful to anyone?

You tell me.  It's somewhat obvious, no?  

&gt; How are you going to get the data?

Hopefully with the help of you guys.  I don't have a method of collecting data yet, but I suspect I will have to make a spreadsheet online and ""hire"" some respected redditors here to help me record the results of professional 6v6 games and the classes used (and some defining characteristics of the game, like time spent, kills per team, kills per player, connection problems causing delays, etc.)  The ""payoff"" of being ""hired"" would be that you would get free access to the result when finished, being that you get knowledge that competitive teams would want.  Want, as in, would possibly pay in-game currency like refined for.  

&gt; But how are you going to get a statistically-significant sample size?

A mixture of the above, and some self-made simulation based on the results of the above.  Basically, I'm collected a few thousand data points in the first round above, then making a simulation based on it that will help me pound out billions of data points.  As the first-round collection increases in sample size, the simulation becomes more accurate.  

&gt; Will the results of simulation be open to the public to learn from?

Depends on how useful the /r/tf2 and related communities are in helping me collect data.  

&gt; Are you a le fuckign F2P player?

Yes, but with two years of good experience.  Soon to upgrade to Premium when I buy everyone in a 6-member team we have some Mann-up tickets and surplus vouchers later this week.  I'm a good player but not (yet) at the professional level -- another 500 hours will probably give that.

Because we all know someone is going to ask it in the comments section.  

&gt; What statistical knowledge do you have?

A 5/5 on the AP Statistics AP Exam, some outside self-driven knowledge, the ability to model simulations.  So I'm not like a doctorate in Statistics, but I'm knowledgeable to complete something like this.  

&gt; What knowledge do you have on modeling simulations?

I'm what some call a ""Computer Science Prodigy"" (and what others call an ""autistic little fuck"", though I do lead a relatively normal extrovert life); I have experience with writing the course curriculum for a 3rd year Computer Engineering undergraduate class during an internship at a top-ten ranked US university, I've won multiple state science fairs, etc.  This is easily within my range and it's probably the easiest part of this project to complete.  

&gt; Future outcomes from this study?

If things go well, I could hire myself out to professional teams or something, run a statistical analysis on their performances, and be an advisor to them on how to win a larger percentage of games.  And if they're a cool team filled with cool dudes I'd probs do it for free.  But I need to complete this study first.

Do any of you know any books/websites/resources of where I could find a list of architectural terms translated between German and English?

FYI: I am working on a construction site, so it is more or less technical terms that would be seen on construction documents and not as much pre-design

1f9z1o,1,2013-05-29,Statistical Study of Most Effective 6v6 Team Class Arrangements,[deleted],tf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1f9z1o/statistical_study_of_most_effective_6v6_team/,"Oi,

I'm a High-School aged kid who has a profound interest in the applied science of Statistics.  And, no shit, I love TF2 as well, since I'm here right now.  I've taken a large interest in amateur and professional 6v6 gaming in competitive TF2 -- there's a lot more class-based strategy when there aren't one-per-class limits.  I.e, you could have:

* Aggressive Scout

* Frontline Medic

* Primary Pocket Heavy

* Secondary Pocket Demo

* Tertiary Pocket Soldier

* Spy

For an overall aggressive team.  On the other hand:

* Backline Engineer

* Support Medic

* Sniper

* Backline Support Engineer

* Roaming Pyro

* Demoman

For a staunchly defensive tactic.

Of course, these are two extremes.

There are millions of combinations -- especially when strategies are considered.  A ""frontline pocket soldier"" and a ""frontline pocket demo"" share more attributes in terms of strategy and game flow with each other than a ""frontline pocket soldier"" and a ""backline roaming solider"", even though the latter comparison is between two of the same class.  Those ""backline"", ""frontline"", ""pocket"", etc. adjectives are essentially as important an implication strategy as the class itself, as you all most likely know from experience, whether you've played 6v6 or not.  In 6v6 however, a single weak link in the strategy can ruin a whole set of rounds.  Some example class adjectives:

* Frontline -- Player will play at the front line of action

* Pocket -- Player will be healed and Uber'd by a Medic

* Support -- For engineers, they help another engineer build their buildings before building their own -- good for pregame.  For medics, it means a medic that doesn't have a single pocket, but goes around and heals/Ubers more randomly based on situation without obligation to a single player.  

&gt; So, what's the point of all of this?

I'm going to do a study (of sorts) using statistically sound methods to determine what types of class arrangements are best suited to fight against other arrangements.  

&gt; How is this useful to anyone?

You tell me.  It's somewhat obvious, no?  

&gt; How are you going to get the data?

Hopefully with the help of you guys.  I don't have a method of collecting data yet, but I suspect I will have to make a spreadsheet online and ""hire"" some respected redditors here to help me record the results of professional 6v6 games and the classes used (and some defining characteristics of the game, like time spent, kills per team, kills per player, connection problems causing delays, etc.)  The ""payoff"" of being ""hired"" would be that you would get free access to the result when finished, being that you get knowledge that competitive teams would want.  Want, as in, would possibly pay in-game currency like refined for.  

&gt; But how are you going to get a statistically-significant sample size?

A mixture of the above, and some self-made simulation based on the results of the above.  Basically, I'm collected a few thousand data points in the first round above, then making a simulation based on it that will help me pound out billions of data points.  As the first-round collection increases in sample size, the simulation becomes more accurate.  

&gt; Will the results of simulation be open to the public to learn from?

Depends on how useful the /r/tf2 and related communities are in helping me collect data.  

&gt; Are you a le fuckign F2P player?

Yes, but with two years of good experience.  Soon to upgrade to Premium when I buy everyone in a 6-member team we have some Mann-up tickets and surplus vouchers later this week.  I'm a good player but not (yet) at the professional level -- another 500 hours will probably give that.

Because we all know someone is going to ask it in the comments section.  

&gt; What statistical knowledge do you have?

A 5/5 on the AP Statistics AP Exam, some outside self-driven knowledge, the ability to model simulations.  So I'm not like a doctorate in Statistics, but I'm knowledgeable to complete something like this.  

&gt; What knowledge do you have on modeling simulations?

I'm what some call a ""Computer Science Prodigy"" (and what others call an ""autistic little fuck"", though I do lead a relatively normal extrovert life); I have experience with writing the course curriculum for a 3rd year Computer Engineering undergraduate class during an internship at a top-ten ranked US university, I've won multiple state science fairs, etc.  This is easily within my range and it's probably the easiest part of this project to complete.  

&gt; Future outcomes from this study?

If things go well, I could hire myself out to professional teams or something, run a statistical analysis on their performances, and be an advisor to them on how to win a larger percentage of games.  And if they're a cool team filled with cool dudes I'd probs do it for free.  But I need to complete this study first.  

&gt; Anything else?

This is a preliminary interest thread.  If no interest is shown, I'll do my best to get results on my own, and keep them to myself.  If people want to participate, I'll make another series of threads after this (maybe organized in an informal subreddit to keep things clean) to update on results and such.

1f9xk3,17,2013-05-29,Been lurking on /r/aves for a while from across the ocean. Couple of questions for you guys...,itchymuller,aves,https://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/1f9xk3/been_lurking_on_raves_for_a_while_from_across_the/,"So I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while now. I'm flying to the states (Boston, MA) in a week for an internship and will stay for 6 months. I'm utterly surprised at the huge difference of style at what is popular here and what is popular in Europe(Netherlands). 
First and foremost: A lot of popular DJ's in the States have already lost their superstar-status here and are considered mainstream and/or bygones. Let's see: Tiesto, Armin van Buuren, Afrojack, Sunnery James/Ryan Marciano, Sydney Samson. Those guys were hot, like 5 years ago maybe. (Not being judgemental here, I danced to that music at that time as well).

Now we saw a big shift here in the past years from house/progressive house/trance to more of a techno/techhouse/deephouse/nu-disco music. DJs like Joris Voorn, The Magician, Marco Carola, Stimming, Solomon, Karmon (Diynamic label in it's entirety), Innvervisions label... you name it. Those are really the reining music bosses here.

I was wondering: How is the techno/techhouse scene in the USA? Are there any nu-disco/indie house DJs that I should know of? Any deephouse festivals this summers near Boston? 

Thanks!"
1f9whn,0,2013-05-29,[20M] Wondering if others have been in this very strange situation. [20F] [21F],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f9whn/20m_wondering_if_others_have_been_in_this_very/,"I cheated. No doubt about that.

I've been with [21F] about 3.5 years and she's not only the person I've been in love with since freshman year but also my best friend. At the start of the fall semester we will be moving in to a 2 bedroom apartment with a friend. It's a 12 month lease and neither of us could afford the place if we were not splitting the price.

Right now she's back in our hometown and has a job. I'm in our college town taking classes and also have a job. This means we can only see each other on Saturday and Sunday (its an hour drive) and I stay at her parents house with her when I visit. She straight up doesn't want  to drive down and visit me. This, in turn, means our sex life has diminished and she doesn't seem to care very much about that.

Meanwhile, I started talking to [20F], a friend I made earlier in the school year because she was in a relationship with my roommate and we also were both raised in the same religion and both left it. We always got along well but i hadn't really seen her for awhile because their breakup was less than clean.

Apparently she smoked together/hooked up with my roommate again just before he left for a summer internship, and it drove her emotions pretty high. She turned to me to talk to about it and we both expressed how lonely we were stuck in town without many friends. This led to us deciding to smoke together and hang out. (both smoking weed and me hanging out with other girls are something [21F] would vehemently disagree with, so I have kept it all secret)

[20F] came over and we watched some movies/shows together while I worked on some homework. We had pretty much agreed to just do our own thing, and really liked the idea of having someone else nearby while doing so. She didn't have a piece so we didn't smoke, but when it got late she decided to stay the night. Both of us longed for some physical contact and neither of us meant for cuddling to turn into sex, but it did.

Cut to the morning and we parted ways. I was actually headed off for a trip with [21F] and her parents for memorial weekend. We continued to text (in secret via google voice) and both agreed that it was a one-time mistake and that we would work to not let it happen again. She still had feelings for my roommate and felt bad both because of that and because I had a SO. I really didn't feel as bad as I should have. I didn't so much see that as cheating and saying it was a one-time mistake made it easier to write it off.

The trip was great and there was no weirdness between me and [21F]. We even got a rare chance to fool around alone in the hotel room. I don't feel any less in love with her.

Cut to Monday. I got back home to college town and [20F] came over again. This time she had a piece but didnt feel like smoking, so it was more of watching netflix and doing homework. This time we went to sleep with me on the futon and her on the bed. 

Here's where I become a horrible person. I knew she was laying there in only underwear and a tshirt, and I made a conscious choice to switch to the bed. The futon was very uncomfortable and I used that as an excuse, but I probably could have toughed it out. She immediately expressed an desire to have sex and I went right along with it. The sex we had was phenomenal. I'm much less experienced than she is, but we both felt very satisfied with it. 

After we were done, she told me she loves cuddling but that would feel too wrong when I have a gf. I was disappointed but knew she was right, and we fell asleep. The next morning I again left for school but this time I had to give her my key as I wouldn't be back until late in the evening and she did not have to work that day. She did some errands and then came back to my place before i got home and just chilled there.

Have I mentioned how much I trust [20F]? I've told her almost everything about my life and she's confided similarly in me, more than she ever has in someone. I don't think I would want to be in a real relationship with her but I adore her as a person. She likewise does not have romantic attachment to me, and would absolutely not tell anyone about what we did or try to use it against me. She is leaving for a different college at the end of the summer, so this is quite literally something that will not be found out by anyone unless I directly tell them. 

Anyways, during our texting after the second time we had sex, we both agreed that doing it twice was much worse morally. Again we resolved to either sleep separately or with clothes on and without touching. Last night we finally smoked together and I fell asleep earlier than usual on the bed. I thought she was going to join me later but when I awoke this morning I found that she had slept on the futon. Though I felt bad that she had slept there without a very good blanket, I'm glad that we did not fuck again.

And then I wrote this. Part of me just wanted to get this all out there somewhere. I know what I did was wrong, but I think it would be too harmful to my life to tell [21F] about it. It would probably end or ruin our relationship, and in the process it would mangle our housing plans and lose me my best friend. [20F] is leaving at the end of the summer and that will be the end of any infidelity on my part. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Cheated in such a way that there's no risk of someone finding out? How do you feel about it and how did it all turn out for you?

**tldr: I cheated with a friend and won't get caught. I'm still hanging out with said friend. I don't want to tell my SO about it and almost definitely will not. I am without doubt a bad person for all of this, but feel free to reassure me of that.**

- *June 2012* Left for Peace Corps 2 year assignment with intention of grad school / job afterwards
- *October 2012* Sent home for surgery on my ankle due to injury in Africa
- *November 2012 - March 2013* Worked a series of part time low wage jobs while trying to find work that would be flexible with my surgery in April and my inability to carry objects / walk long distance. No luck.
- *April 2013* Had ankle surgery finally. Started a $13/hour internship (ugh) at a regional planning non-profit, enrolled in graduate school this fall (environmental engineering)

I am basically just trying to get by. My resume is great - I have ample experience, several internships under my belt, and I am a very resiliant guy. I was in Peace Corps Liberia eating dirt and pooping in a hole. I have a chemical engineering degree and I am a smart guy.

So that's the background: Here's the question.

I am hoping to find a full-time job with big-boy pay still. I won't be able to walk without crutches until July. But! I found an opening at an environmental consulting group which has hired people with far less experience than me (one of them being my friend). I enthusiasticly applied on their website, on my college's alumni job board, cold-emailed some HR folks... no response. 

My friend forwarded my resume, chatted with me online, and said

&gt;Hi Friendly_Trash_Man, it turns out ____ office will interview candidates on June 4th. My manager mentioned they will try to schedule you interview on the same day if possible. Just want to give you a heads up. Best of luck!

I haven't heard anything back yet - June 4th is less than a week away. I really want to talk to someone there and ask about it.

Do I call them? Email someone from their website? Just wait by my phone impatiently? I would drop my internship (which pays less and is not in my area of interest - but is 100% better than no job or a call center, as far as my resume is concerned) and take evening classes at grad school if I could. Job in my field + 2X pay &gt; what I am doing. I really want this job. It feels within reach. If I can get that interview, I am confident I can get that job.

Any advice on where to go from here? Should I just keep waiting - I have only been at my new job for not-even two months. I put it on my resume so that it didn't look like I was slacking for 8 months. 

The lack of contact after reaching out to them in 5 different ways is killing me!"

1f9vwv,0,2013-05-29,"A ""what if"" question: all undergraduate education is online for free",Helen___Keller,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f9vwv/a_what_if_question_all_undergraduate_education_is/,"TL;DR: What would be the economic and social ramifications if all undergraduate education was replaced with online education, nearly freely available? 


Okay, so here are the assumptions I'm making in this what-if question:

1. Let's suppose online education has been improved steadily over the course of the years. Revolutions in understanding the learning process let us tailor specific education programs for any undergraduate major. Studies show that it is as effective as, or more effective than, a traditional education.

2. Through some method, online education is also reliable in that you can't just have your engineer best friend take tests for you and claim an engineering degree.

3. Universities still exist, but primarily for academic research and graduate level education. Basically, suppose that all traditional undergraduate education ceases to exist. Many dorms have been replaced by research labs or whatever. There may still be some 'boarding colleges' for undergraduate education, but there are few, and mostly for the wealthy.

4. With the advent of online education, a 'standard' education works like this:
Up through high school is the same, except rather than worrying about college applications, students worry about which online program to invest their time in. Advanced students start early.
Then, online education, nearly for free, for either a traditional field (psychology, chemistry, engineering ...) or for any craft (electrician, plumbing, ...). During this process, work part time / get internships if possible.
Then, Those particularly interested in a traditional field apply and go for graduate school as in the real world.

5. These online education programs are not directly analogous to current undergraduate degrees. Whether or not you get a 'general education' is your choice. Writers need not take college algebra, engineers need not take english classes. In any case, what you do learn is reflected by the 'certificate(s)' you have. An employer will know whether or not you took english comp I and II or whatever.


Returning to the TLDR, my question is what social and economic ramifications would result from this?
Things that occur to me:

1. Without undergraduates as a source of cash, would research universities lack funding?


2. The ability to learn part-time for nearly free would reduce barriers to entry to many fields for those willing to put in the time to learn engineering, or whatever. Would workers in high-demand fields see decreased overall salary if more people had access to this education? Is this a good thing or a bad thing, then?


3. Stereotypically, college is a time when young adults explore in many ways, include socially. Do you consider this necessary to a 'complete' education? Would there be a way to make up for it if undergraduate was all online?


4. Degrees are often used in the real world as indicators of competency. A job applicant may be outright rejected for not having a degree, where the same applicant would be interviewed if they had an entirely irrelevant degree. Would it be the same in this what-if? Given that degrees are broken up (you don't need the general education to get the engineering degree, for example), would employers still want the 'whole' undergraduate degree (including gen-eds, college algebra, etc) to signify competency?"
1f9vh2,1,2013-05-29,How important is having an internship?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1f9vh2/how_important_is_having_an_internship/,"I'm starting my senior year and will getting a degree in Finance from the local city university. (aka the 'community college') I have no idea what job I specifically want in the future. But I like Finance and Management so I hope to end up somewhere in the two.

I currently work two jobs. One of which is retail and involves me doing a little bit of everything. I've been a part of almost every operation that happens in a big box store. I have been offered many management positions, but due to scheduling conflicts, I still haven't been able to make that work. The 2nd is an IT job. (Basic, nothing special) About 40 hours a week between the two on average.

I've been working for those companies for the past couple years. I've also been working since I was 14 so I have straight employment with no employment gaps since then. 

While I think that is good and puts me ahead of a lot of others, should I still be looking for an internship? Or do interviewers prefer to see someone that just works a lot (even if some of the work isn't directly related)

I've looked at internships and many of them will probably require me to lose at least one of my jobs due to scheduling. And I like money. I don't want an unpaid internship, but if it's something that is very necessary for me to get a career then I would do it. I'm going to be looking for a job in NYC so there's lots of competition.

I have been interning at an ad agency and it has been a ""dream come true"" internship. There has been a learning curve but for the most part I have managed. I got roped into a big side project at this agency and have been busting my ass to do it right. I have skipped class to run errands for it, spent days when I'm not supposed to be in working on it, and constantly emailing and checking my phone to make sure everything is going smoothly.  

A couple weeks ago I was asked to audit a bunch of car dealerships - I had struggled with it before so this time I really wanted to do a good job. Turns out I had to be out of the office for the next two weeks unexpectantly working on the other big side project that has been consuming all my time. I have been interviewing people on camera around the city and at the local news station. During this time, a bunch of emails got sent to my interning email that I can only access at the agency office. Because I did not go in during these two weeks I missed them. 

Yesterday I got an email saying that auditing had to be done and that we were past the client's deadline. The moment I got the email, I realized that this was bad. I had had no idea when the deadline was and had completely forgotten about the auditing. Later I received an email saying that I had to come in and ""chat"" with the person in charge of me.

I am terrified right now. I know I messed up, but it was only because I did not know when the project needed to be done and because I hadn't been in the office. I don't know how to check that email from home.  In fact, if I had had any idea I would have done it at home.

Plus... I'm pretty sure the ""chat"" that the agency wants to have with me is to get rid of me. 

Now I am having so my anxiety and I can't stop shaking. I have never been this nervous in my life. I feel like I just fucked up one of the best opportunities ever granted to me.

I've pushed myself too hard. I can't intern 20 hours a week and have it turn into a 30 hour intern week on top of 16 credit hours of college, being a student leader for an organization at my college, and being a junior designer for a non profit.

I have completely reached my breaking point. I'm shaking, and terrified. I'm scared to check my email daily because there will be an email from someone who needs me to do something. I can't sleep at night anymore and have been only getting 2 hours per night. I'm behind in school and for the first time in college (I'm a junior) had to drop a class. I've been chronically ill with a horrible cold that keeps getting me down.

Also - I just went broke over taking my cat to the vet because he is sick. 

I want it all to end. I want to quit so badly but I shouldn't. I haven't been able to relax for two months. I know that this will all be over one day, but I am just so scared. Right now I'm so immersed in the situation that I can't even see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Edit: spelling/grammar
Edit: thanks to everyone for responding. It seems that there was a huge miscommunication with what I was supposed to be doing. I am finding ways to cope and need to focus on my small victories. I now know I am not super woman and should not commit to two big internships while going to school. It sounds obvious but the opportunities were too awesome pass. "

My final project was to create an online portfolio, branded and all, with our creative development projects, quantitative, qualitative research endeavors along with a few unrelated work that we're proud of along with a resume of course. The only work experience I have outside of school projects is this student-run agency out of a classroom. We did have real clients (but lackluster and flaky ones at that) but I feel it's SOMETHING. I took a Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences where we learned a lot about statistics, but I still don't quite understand terms such as p-value. I need to work on those analytical skills because that's definitely where I want to end up. In either an agency or a market research firm, where I can talk to consumers quantitatively or qualitatively and translate that data into a story for clients. I'm just wondering if you could guys maybe take a look at my website, resume, etc. and give me a few pointers. I don't think I'm ready to start applying to jobs (even though I turn 23 in 15 days), I think a paid internship would suffice for now.


P.S. I don't own any professional clothing at this point (I'm 6'4, a 32x36 and need to obviously step up my game when it comes to interview time). That's another thing. My interviewing skills are disgustingly terrible. I clam up, freak the fuck out and always forget what I'm talking about.

In fact, I grew to have feelings for her. She had a medical issue in her intestine. Worried, I kept telling her to keep me updated. Apparently there was a mass that could be cancerous, so they biopsied it. She never updated me after that. Biopsies don't take very long. I noticed her get incredibly depressed so my intuition pointed to cancer.
heres where it gets sticky.
In this time frame I got incredibly busy with a ton of aspects in my life taking a foul turn. I became really focused in trying to keep my head above water. She also told me that she loved me. I freaked out and never told her that I loved her back because of my mixed up feelings and instantly avoided her until I could get my feelings in order. It's only so weird because she is 26, I'm about to turn 21. I also have a strong gut feeling that she sees me more as a brother. Because of all of these circumstances, I was unapproachable. In my mind, I wasn't there for her. I was a main person in her life to make her smile and I wasn't even able to do that for quite some time. She has told other people in our circle of people except me. I confirmed my intuition of her having cancer through a mutual friend. She doesn't know that I know.
I was planning on talking to her about her results before I knew about her having cancer. I got a hold of her and told her that I can see that there is something seriously wrong with her. I'm not sure what (lie) but I think we need to talk. I told her that I loved her and I let her know that I'm not letting her go either (she said that she would never ever let me go ever). I also said that I haven't there for her before but I am now. She told me she wanted to meet up with me today and I moved my whole schedule around to accommodate her, I didn't get a response until late tonight. She rescheduled for tomorrow but I have my doubts because she doesn't have so good of a track record.
We both got accepted to an internship out of state with the same mutual friend that I spoke of earlier. She made plans of treatment while she was out there, putting a lot of pressure on our mutual friend to drive her to an airport or all the way back to our home state to get treatment.
I hope to have her let me know so I can help. I feel absolutely terrible for not being there before. I don't even know if I'm doing the right thing anymore. I'm a wreck. I just want to talk and so far a bunch of random strangers are all I have. So if you read this, I do apologize for any terrible grammar or anything that does not make any sense. I will answer questions and clarify whatever needs to be clarified.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a full year. We go to the same college in the States, but we are working in different countries over the summer so we are ""long-distance"" for 4 months. This has been hard, but we've been doing okay so far.


Here's where it gets a little hinky. Once we get back from summer, we'll be spending our last semester together. This is because my boyfriend, Nate, is graduating and moving back to his home city (City 1) in Asia, and if his job this summer goes well, will be working full-time in City 2 (also in Asia). So City 1 and City 2 are going to be his main homes after school, and he doesn't plan on ever coming back to the United States again (due to a mixture of reasons, cultural and career-related). After he graduates, I still have one semester left to finish college.


*Note: sorry for the vagueness of the locations; I am super paranoid and feel that the combination of cities and the situation is unique and there's a 1-in-1000 chance he will chance upon this thread.*


We have, at this point, realized that due to 1) my being primarily based in the States, all of my job opportunities will likely be in the States in the future, as well as my friends and my life, really and 2) his life is back in Asia, where he has friends and family, in addition to him not liking the culture in the States and not wanting to live here, that we should not pursue our relationship together after he graduates. **We will break up once he leaves the States.**


This decision, I believe, has nothing to do with how much we love each other, or how compatible we are. It is purely because realistically, our paths are never going to cross after he leaves. It will be too hard, and even unfair for one of us to uproot ourselves and sacrifice our familiar lives, job opportunities, and a lot of other things to move across the world to be with the other. We intend to make the best of the time we have left. 

Unfortunately, it has also been breaking my heart since we've reached the decision, and as a result, I've been foolishly looking for ways to make this work.I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I'm supposed to give up on the one guy I've come to love because of something out of our control. We share the same heritage, same sense of humor, sense of financial responsibilities, and most political and philosophical issues, so all location challenges aside, we are pretty compatible. Damn me that I've always been the type who can never just let it go.

**Here's the catch, or what made me start having these stupid hopes:**
I am interning for a very large and well-known company based in NYC (where I will be this summer) that has headquarters all around the world, including one in City 2. What coincidence, then, that City 2 has been my dream work city ever since junior year of high school when I was lucky enough to vacation there. I fell in love with the city, the people, and the culture almost immediately (this goes way back before our relationship, and has nothing to do with Nate).
I know it's a long shot. But I somehow convinced myself that at the end of my internship, if I can score a full-time job with this company (reasonable) and somehow magically be able to transfer to the City 2 location in a different department (not as realistic)...I can't help but wonder if we would be able to reconsider our ""planned breakup"" (super really not realistic, at this point I don't even know if this is healthy for my dignity).


Reddit, I've been a long-time lurker and admirer of the sound advice that you've given to people here. Can you help me figure this out? Please slap some sense into me, no kid gloves needed, honest opinions appreciated. Heck, at this point, the fact that you've read this far is appreciated. :) Also go ahead if you have questions, I'm sure I should have clarified something or other better. Thank you.


**TL;DR** I've been beating myself up for allowing myself to hope for a chance to simultaneously land a job in my dream city and continue my relationship with my boyfriend. I can't tell if I'm grasping at straws and need to wake the fuck up or if this is actually a glimmer of hope that I can work towards this summer.

1f92fb,17,2013-05-29,"BF is having a dom/sub online relationship and not telling me about it. We're in an open relationship, but we agreed he'd tell me if he was involved with someone, and his non-disclosure really bothers me.",[deleted],nonmonogamy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1f92fb/bf_is_having_a_domsub_online_relationship_and_not/,"Throwaway account because my boyfriend is a Redditor. Sorry in advance about the wall of text.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years--we're both in our late 20s/early 30s, talked about marriage, etc.

We've had an open relationship since the beginning, and, minus a few bumps, it's gone pretty well. HOWEVER. The only reason we opened our relationship up was because I have a significantly higher sex drive than he does (I like sex daily, whereas he'd be happy with once a month.)

He and I met online, and when we met, he was VERY good at seduction. Teased me, was a bit dominant (which I like), etc. However, after I moved to live closer to him, I discovered that while he can talk a great game, he does in fact have a low libido and severe anxiety issues, and so the pressure of having a serious partner (I was his first EVERYTHING) killed any desire he had to do anything sexual with me.

We've been really happy these past five years--our relationship just keeps getting better and stronger--except for sex. Other than that, he's pretty much the perfect partner.

So anyway. About two years into our relationship, I went to borrow his phone to make a call, and accidentally saw a new email he'd left open. Because of the content one email I saw, I kept reading, and it turned out that he'd been having a steamy online fling with a woman on a message board we were both members of.

I was devastated. Yes, we had an open relationship. But (1) he never told me about her, and (2) he was giving her sexual attention that he wasn't giving me.

I confronted him about it, he broke things off with her, and I told him that he was welcome to have ""things"" with other women, online or otherwise, but (A) he had to tell me, and (B) I didn't feel it was fair that he gave someone else something I wasn't getting. He agreed.

I will freely admit to snooping off and on in his email, and he flirted a little with various women, but nothing I'd consider intense or crossing a line, so I never told him about it. Our sex life never improved, but, whatever.

The following year, we actually saw a counselor together, to try to resolve some of our frustrations in the sex department. That actually really helped--our sex life didn't get better, but I was able to better understand why he wasn't sexually into me. Sex is an inherently fraught thing for him, for reasons he wasn't able to fully explain, but as such, it's much easier for him to get into when he knows he doesn't have any commitments to the woman.

Two years later, same thing happened. I hadn't snooped for several months, but when I noticed him hiding his phone from me again, I went and snooped, and sure enough, he had a thing going on with TWO other women. But before I could figure out how to confront him about it, things blew up--they both were friends, and didn't know that he was flirting with both of them, one of them fell in love with him, and told a mutual friend of ours that she was devastated that he wouldn't break up with me and move to be with her, since I was clearly a horrible person and she was the right person for him. The mutual friend told me, and I confronted my boyfriend. 

This time I wasn't devastated--I was very straightforward, and told him that he had been lying to me, and I didn't appreciate it, and while I understood why he wanted to be sexual with another woman (or two!) and was fine with it, what I was NOT ok with was that he didn't tell me about it. He apologized, broke things off with both of them, and that was that. They were pissed off at him, and rightfully so!! He was always VERY clear that he was happy to stay in our relationship and wasn't planning on leaving, but they still both wanted monogamy, and it was pretty obvious from their emails.

So anyway. I've occasionally (every few months) snooped over the past couple of years, and haven't found anything other than mild flirting. But, yet again, about a month ago, he started the familiar pattern of hiding his phone, so I went and snooped, and sure enough, he has a very hot D/S online relationship going on with another woman.

I'm bothered by this for two reasons.

1) She's married, and it doesn't appear that her husband knows about this. Although they don't have any plans to meet, and I STRONGLY doubt he would do so knowing his anxiety issues, so, maybe it doesn't matter? It still bothers me that he doesn't know, though.

2) HE HASN'T TOLD ME. HE KNOWS HE'S SUPPOSED TO TELL ME. I've always been 100% upfront about my other partners (and currently I've only had one other partner for the past about 18 months. No surprises there.)

And to be honest, there's also the part of me that's a bit jealous that she gets that from him and I don't... but really, it's mainly the second point--the fact that HE'S NOT TELLING ME ABOUT THIS despite the fact that THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED ON. And, because of this, it's hard to not feel cheated on.

So I don't know what I'm asking, here. I don't want to leave him. Honestly, other than the sex thing, he's an absolutely amazing partner--loving, respectful, and a partner in the true sense of the word--we work amazingly together as a team. Am I stupid to hope that I can somehow get him comfortable telling me that he's at least having an online thing with anoher woman? I don't even want details--I just want to know, dammit.

**TL;DR: Open relationship for 5 years. Boyfriend doesn't have any other physical partners, just online relationships. Despite agreeing to tell me about any online relationships he's having, he has repeatedly lied by omission and not told me. How can I make him more comfortable with telling me that he's involved with someone online? Or should I just be happy he's happy?**

**EDIT:** I sat down with him last night and didn't bring up the ""other woman,"" but I did tell him that he's talked about dealing with his anxiety many times before, and he needs to take the next step with that. (Last year, after four years of me pushing him, he FINALLY went on antidepressants, and they did help a lot, but now he needs therapy!) I actually watched him as he emailed Kaiser (his health insurer) and asked them what the process was for getting a referral for counseling. I don't know if he'll go through with it, but I'm going to keep pushing him. I don't know that I'm going to bring up his online relationship just yet. He's finally in the process of finding an internship to finish his master's degree, something he's been putting off for the past YEAR, so I think doing that and doing his own counseling are two good first steps. 

Then, if he's doing both of those things and still talking with the woman in another 2-3 months, I'll figure out how to address it at that point in time. I just wish I could get him to understand that I'm FINE with him having the relationship--I just need to know about it. Honestly, I really, REALLY hate snooping. I don't want to do that--I don't think it's fair to him. But neither is him hiding something major like that."
1f926q,2,2013-05-29,Wanting to help a girl with a terrible disease who I also have mixed up feelings for.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f926q/wanting_to_help_a_girl_with_a_terrible_disease/,"There's this girl that I got really close with over the year.  In fact, I grew to have feelings for her.  She had a medical issue in her intestine.  Worried, I kept telling her to keep me updated.  Apparently there was a mass that could be cancerous, so they biopsied it. She never updated me after that. Biopsies don't take very long. I noticed her get incredibly depressed so my intuition pointed to cancer.  

heres where it gets sticky.

In this time frame I got incredibly busy with a ton of aspects in my life taking a foul turn.  I became really focused  in trying to keep my head above water.  She also told me that she loved me.  I freaked out and never told her that I loved her back because of my mixed up feelings and instantly avoided her until I could get my feelings in order.  It's only so weird because she is 26, I'm about to turn 21.  I also have a strong gut feeling that she sees me more as a brother.  Because of all of these circumstances, I was unapproachable.  In my mind, I wasn't there for her.  I was a main person in her life to make her smile and I wasn't even able to do that for quite some time.  She has told other people in our circle of people except me.  I confirmed my intuition of her having cancer through a mutual friend.  She doesn't know that I know.  

I was planning on talking to her about her results before I knew about her having cancer.  I got a hold of her and told her that I can see that there is something seriously wrong with her.  I'm not sure what (lie) but I think we need to talk.  I told her that I loved her and I let her know that I'm not letting her go either (she said that she would never ever let me go ever).  I also said that I haven't there for her before but I am now.  She told me she wanted to meet up with me today and I moved my whole schedule around to accommodate her, I didn't get a response until late tonight.  She rescheduled for tomorrow but I have my doubts because she doesn't have so good of a track record.

We both got accepted to an internship out of state with the same mutual friend that I spoke of earlier.  She made plans of treatment while she was out there, putting a lot of pressure on our mutual friend to drive her to an airport or all the way back to our home state to get treatment.

I hope to have her let me know so I can help.  I feel absolutely terrible for not being there before.  I don't even know if I'm doing the right thing anymore.  I'm a wreck.  I just want to talk and so far a bunch of random strangers are all I have.  So if you read this, I do apologize for any terrible grammar or anything that does not make any sense.  I will answer questions and clarify whatever needs to be clarified.

This is my piece. "

I'm currently an ECE student going into my ""4th year"" in the fall (quotes explained shortly) at a top 20 university in Canada.

The reason I say ""4th year"" is because I've been at school for 6 years, going into my 7th year of my bachelor's in the fall. I have screwed up a lot - having failed a bunch of courses in 1st, 2nd and 3rd year. As a result I only have a cGPA of 2.2 (which made my self-efficacy take a hit and make me question myself) and am worried about job prospects after graduation in May of 2014.

I initially entered the computer engineering stream because out of high school I really only had an interest in software and computer hardware. However after spending a number of years in engineering school, I became more interested in sustainable design and building construction having worked for an electrical &amp; mechanical consulting firm for three summers (I was really fortunate and was able to get this job through a connection). It's for this reason that I have started taking more electrical courses and am planning on taking fundamental courses in electrical power such as switch-mode energy conversion, distributed generation etc. this fall (most students take these core courses in 3rd year). However, last summer I did not work at this firm due to personal reasons and was not really employed (I'm worried about this gap in my employment history as well). This summer I tried applying to about 15-20 internships but was unable to get an engineering-related job and so I currently do data entry full-time.

I guess what I'm asking is... how screwed am I? I would like to try and improve my situation. Some ideas I have include taking the LEED Green Associate exam this summer because it is something that interests me (although I'm not sure how much employers would care) and joining an extra-curricular Solar House design team this summer.

I'm also doing some mobile app development for a course I'm taking this fall/spring so if things go south with the electrical job hunt, I can perhaps have a contingency plan and go into software.

Another thing is that I still live at home with my parents - I wanted to move out for the longest time but it just never ended up happening due to various reasons and it is one of the biggest things I regret. I feel like this would make me jumpy when job hunting after I graduate, looking for that first job that would let me get up on my financial feet, and not necessarily looking for the right job. Or is this not a valid concern because I should probably just pick the first semi-relevant engineering job due to my poor grades?

I know a lot of my thoughts are disjointed and that there is a lot of stuff here but I guess what I'm really asking is: am I in trouble for post-grad life in terms of jobs and if so, what can I do to remedy the situation? Any general advice for someone in my situation / what would you do?

Thank you for reading.

She was my first on everything and vice versa. We broke up when we went to separate colleges; however, to this day we have never let 24 hrs pass without talking or at least sending the other a text message. 
I would visit her a couple times each semester and vice versa. We would act like we were in a relationship when we were with each other (sleeping together etc.). We both knew that if one of us found someone else we would have to just be friends. Sometimes we would talk about dating but when she wanted to date I said no and when I wanted to date she said no. We liked the idea of being able to date new people so it never clicked. 
Now she got into her first relationship since me and it's killing me. We still talk everyday and hang out a lot since we're both home for the summer. Her new boyfriend doesn't like me at all (and I understand). She has already had sex with him (only other guy besides me) but her dad found the condom and really dislikes him now (he doesn't think I've ever had sex with his daughter so her family loves me). 
Before she started officially dating her new boyfriend (when they were just ""exclusive"") her and I still had sex- everyday until she became official with her new boyfriend. She has told me she cannot orgasm with anyone else (which makes me feel better). 
Most importantly, before they started officially dating I told her how much she means to me, and how much I love her. She cried and said I am too late, and she wishes I told her a month ago, but now she likes her new boyfriend and wants to try to make things work with him. He's nice to her and treats her well. They have only dated for a couple days officially but I already don't know what to do. I love her. We hang out for a couple hours everyday, but we don't fool around anymore. Instead we just cuddle and watch GoT. She said she would not date anyone that doesn't trust her and wouldn't let her and I hang out. But now I feel like I've done the biggest mistake of my life by waiting too long to tell her how much I love her and I am broken inside. I have no other close friends so that's why I am turning to you Reddit.

Possibly useless info: She is 20, very high GPA, and doing pre-pharmacy. Her boyfriend is 24. He plays sports for his college (in the Big 12) and has girls hitting on him constantly, but he has no money and works at a restaurant about to graduate with an English degree. I am 20 with an internship that pays too much and very high job security. (computer science major that has had an internship every summer).

I just finished college this month in Kansas City (Not from there originally) and picked up my 5th paid  internship position. The only difference is this time it's in NYC. Actually in DUMBO area. I'll be living in Greenpoint with an old roommate who had moved their a few years ago. The job is paid $20 HR 9-5 / M-F, etc. I am a User Experience / Interface Designer who is trying to cut their chops in NYC. I worked hard through college and came out with a strong portfolio and recommendations. I figured if I'm going to start anywhere while I'm still young this would be the place. 

If the community would be so kind I would love to hear your opinions of Greenpoint? Living there those of you who do / have as well. What kind of expected salary a 20 something should make to live in a relatively safe area? If anyone has any advice about the design fields in the city I would be greatly appreciative as well. 

Thank you very much!"

My dream is to become a film score composer. I both compose, mix, and master audio as a side job, and am extremely talented at it. I am highly recommended by my professors to job requests brought to them. I love the work. It is my true passion. 

I recently got my foot in the door for an internship with Hans Zimmer, probably the most famous film score composer of all time! This would be a dream come true for me, but my tinnitus makes me fear music in a way. It makes me afraid I won't be able to enter this career and that I should just give up now and choose another. This would possibly lead to depression however, due to the amount I love music and the role it plays in my life. 

What should I do? Any comforting thoughts?"

The only problem is that I am having a little trouble coming up with something. I am a mechanical engineering student, and I like aerospace, but really I could work design stuff for just about anything. So I am asking all of you a few things:

Have any of you done something similar?

If so what have you done?

Anyone that has not, what are some ideas?

I'm planning on using an Arduino initially to control the quadcopter and eventually transitioning over to a beagle-bone black once I have gained more experience. 

My plan is to input coordinates on the ground and for the quadcopter to fly through them. At the beginning I just want to get it flying by remote control, get used to writing PID loops to control it, etc. Then I want to add GPS waypoints and I hope to eventually add obstacle avoidance and object tracking through computer vision.

I have some experience programming in various languages, building things through personal projects and FIRST robotics, and doing basic electronics. I'm currently going through ME218a lectures to become more well versed in electronics.

I built a quadcopter frame for a friend a few months ago and I learned a fair amount from that one, mainly things NOT to do. 
I made his frame out of aluminum plate and c channel, and it was much heavier and stronger than needed. 

This time however I want to make a better one.

I know there are premade autopilots like the ardupilot, kk2.0, and the multiwii, but I don't want to use one.

Edit: photo of the frame
http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/8589/2870637orig2.jpg
For the new one I'm thinking of making it out of carbon fiber depending on the cost. Otherwise I will probably use aluminum again, but much thinner plate and 1/16"" square tube.

Just another day in the life of Chase.",[deleted],MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/1f8o0j/herbicides_mapmaking_part_time_jobs_supper_and/,"It's been a busy day. Besides the usual wake-up-at-0530 routine, I actually got to do some pretty nifty things at work and at home. 

Today at work I got to go check out some forestlands that were treated with herbicide and how the forest reacts and recovers from it. Then during our lunch break I got offered the opprotunity for some additional part-time employment doing some IT and media work at one of my coworker's church (this is something I have done part time for about 6 years already back home). Depending on when I'd work and how much it paid I'm thinking about taking the job. I figure that I've got nothing else going on in my free time (woo for living alone!) and the extra cash wouldn't hurt. 

After lunch they taught me how to use my company's GIS (or as they call it RMS) software to make maps to company standards. I managed to do that with only screwing up 5 maps and having to redo them.

Afterwards I went and bought ammo, magazines, and a nice new pearl snap work shirt.

 Got my new [8in chef knife](http://imgur.com/UXdk6Gz) today and used it to make dinner to make mashed [potatoes](http://imgur.com/DEPsN8H) with diced up steak and cheese. 

I also finally realized that the pretty vines growing all over my house were [poison oak](http://imgur.com/a/W1inl). So I have to go into town and I'm buying a vat of glyphosphate (herbicide) at Tractor Supply to hopefully kill all of it. 


And my car still isn't charging my battery. Still trying to figure that one out (and it's definitely not the alternator). 

All in all, it's been a good day. 

How are y'all?

tl;dr: had fun at work, may get a new part-time job in addition to my internship, got a cool new knife, dinner, too much poison oak for comfort. "
1f8nev,1,2013-05-28,Long(ish) story followed by my question about working at an Animal Shelter,animusbulldog,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f8nev/longish_story_followed_by_my_question_about/,"**I enjoy taking pictures. I don't consider myself a photographer, I'm just some guy who enjoys taking pictures off his phone if something catches my eye.**

**I live in LA and** as people who have visited, or live here, k**no**w that it's a pretty big place. People are always going somewhere and doing something. All of the **friends** I had last year when I was in college has gone down to only about 5. Which is perfect for me because I like hanging out with a smaller group. My point being that I have **a lot more** time to just chill **alone**/fill my **time**. Saying that **I** really **like dogs**. I'm **not** a **dog whisper** or anything, but **I do feel like I can bond with dogs** a lot **easier**, and better (9 times of out 10) **than** I can **with people** I meet. It's hard, and probably weird to explain but **I really feel like I can read a dog**. I kind of feel **like I can 'talk to them'.** Not conversations or anything, but I know how their brains are ticking and what they're thinking. I'm sure I'm not the only one in the world who can do this but I guess my point is that I get along with dogs well. **Currently** I don't have one (my parents do so I guess technically I have a dog but not a dog that lives with me). I've been **staying at a family members place for a little**. He **has a dog** and during the time **I've been** here I been **able to** 'hang out' with the dog and **hone my skill**/convince myself I'm more weird than I thought. 


Saying ALL that, the reason I bring up this like for dogs is because one thing I like to do **in my spare time i**s **go to the animal shelter and spend 15/20 mins with each dog (or dogs) in every cage.** Not a lot. I haven't counted how many cages or dog are there. I mean, probably 20/30 dogs...I know **some think that's torture** for them/the dogs, **for** me/**one to** just **go to the shelters to 'taunt and tease' these dogs with thinking they'll get to go to a home**.  but I know that **if I was in jail, I'd rather have a random person want to see me/talk to me/ hug me each week and then go back to my cell then not have that**. Even though I'm only one guy/inmate. That's how I feel it it for the dogs. They love attention and **I bet it's fucking torture for them in the cages**. Humans go crazy in jail and they KNOW what's going on. Dogs have no idea. So **I feel like visiting them keeps them sane**, in a sense. **One thing that made me sad was that there was a new dog at the Shelter and when he first got there he was barking at me and wouldn't even come over to me. I still spent some time with him just so he didn't feel left out. No doubt shouting/barking at SOMEONE is better than no one**. 

**So I came back the next week or so and this time I said hi to him and he sat right down and let me get right to his face. I could actually touch this dog and talk to it face to face. I was amazed, and happy (I like when I can start to see a dogs personality) but at the same time really sad because it meant that the cage had made him scared. He was, I guess, temporarily scarred from this experience of being at the shelter (obviously understandable)**


So, **each time I've gone to the shelter I've taken some pictures that, objectively, aren't too bad**. I mean, considering the pictures of these dogs **on the shelter website are like mugshots for a felon** (they're not terrible pictures of the dogs but they just have no soul) my pictures don't do too badly in displaying a little more character about each dog. 
**I'm gonna call the shelter tomorrow and ask if they want these pictures**. They're just off a phone but they're pretty good quality. **Should I be asking for money for each picture?** I don't want to and I genuinely want to help the dogs, not profit myself. 

**I thought, instead**, proposing an idea that **every time a new dog comes in or every so and so days, I go to the shelter and meet the dog(s), take them out and see if I can make some good (read: Selling) pictures of the dogs?** I guess would that be considered an internship? Or is this a 'I should make it a business idea? 

**TL;DR all in bold**


Thanks guys. Hopefully the **TL;DR** wasn't too hard to read

The truck was not in as ""fresh"" of a condition as the example picture. It showed signs of wear.

This occurred on Monday, the 27th between 1:55-2:00pm. His airbags deployed fortunately. But his car is pretty useless now.

Please, if you live nearby and you have a friend whose truck matches that description and is mysteriously crushed in the front, or you have a neighbor that always has his Red Dodge Truck out front and visible and is now gone, you might know the perpetrator. 

If you live in Austin or surrounding area and you notice a truck in a parking lot that matches that description, look for black metallic paint.
Do not trespass, do not touch anyone's property! A picture of the damage and the plate would be nice though.

But not in the open! PM! No witch hunts!

My friend's internship just ended, he has no benefits right now. Cops basically threw their hands up... ""no cameras"". Insurance company is already trying to figure out how to pay him as little as possible.

I live many states away from him, but I'd still like to help him out somehow.

I haven't seen him drunk in about two years previous to an incident about a month in a half ago.

We were the only ones home, and he stumbled down the stairs and cornered me in the kitchen while I was making myself some dinner. He didn't touch me, but he got really close to my face and kept telling me that I'm disgusting, pointing out specific examples from *years* ago. Along with this, he was talking shit about my mother (they aren't together anymore,) telling me that he's ashamed of me because I'm lazy and irresponsible, mind you, he is unemployed and sits in his room smoking K2 all day; hasn't had a job in three years, he left his job in retail because he ""couldn't handle the stress""- and saying that my only brother isn't likely to amount to much. Mostly it was things about me, though.

A few weeks after that, I went on vacation with a cousin, and while I was there, he called me up and told me that he had left to another state and that he intended on staying there because he ""has been trying all he can to fix me, but he just can't anymore."" (he came back a week after I did.)

Three days ago, he stole $70 from a fundraiser that I have been doing.  I was supposed to turn the money in yesterday but had to make up an excuse and look bad to the organization.

So last night, after he had me go to the store to pick *him* up a few things (walking), a huge storm came in and the lightening was literally no more than thirty five feet in front of the shop. I wasn't about to get struck, so I called and asked him if he could pick me up. The house is about a half of a mile from the store, and it was about 11:00- remember, I went for him. Upon answering, he said ""Don't call me for anything so stupid again."" and proceeded to say a few things in the nastiest, most immature tone I have ever heard an adult use. 

So I called my mother and went to her place. I had a nice long chat with her about my father's behavior. Earlier today, I went to pick up my stuff so I can stay with her, and he's telling my brother awful things about me WHILE I AM STILL THERE. 

Am I in the wrong?

A little context, I'm a sixteen year old girl with a 3.7 GPA. I am on the top of my class and have gotten myself two outstanding internships in education and social work, and I was chosen by my school to be one of the only kids to be able to take classes for free at the local community college- not to toot my own horn, but I'd say I'm very hardworking, pretty ambitious, and only moderately lazy- definitely not irresponsible.

So I know that you probably read the title and may have already written this off. But I promise no wall of text, just the facts. 


So I was in a great relationship with a girl who I met in college. She had moved near me after graduation (got an internship coincidentally near me), and I had 3.5 great years. Dates, dancing, hanging out with friends (both together and separate), flowers, romance, etc.; it was great overall. It was one of those relationships that I was moving towards proposing towards her. Then came this shady fella that she worked with. I wasn't jealous really of him, but I did suspect that he was up to no good. 


The thing that started getting me suspicious was that he asked her to go with him ""as friends"" to a wedding, and she asked me if it was okay that she went with him. I told her I wasn't really comfortable with it, but I thought that it would be a way for her to get out and meet new friends (she didn't have a whole lot besides me and college friends locally.) She told me at that point that ""well, it didn't matter what you said, I was going to go anyways."" That was about 6 months before she broke up with me. 


Towards the end, she told me that ""something was wrong"" but really couldn't quantify what it was. I sat down with her and talked through it, asking her if it was something that I did, or what she felt. She felt that I didn't value her (I lived for the last 8 months about 200 miles away, talked frequently, did Facetime as well as visited home every other weekend. I brought her flowers, danced with her, kept asking her what she wanted to do every time in addition to making a decision together for both of us, etc. So I'm not sure what more I could have done much more. 


She became distant, really talked this other guy up with all my family and friends, and then decided that, as I was out shopping for a ring to call me, argue with me and then upon asking me say ""we're done."" I wanted to work through things with her, but she decided that she had had enough (really it felt like I wanted to fix things and she didn't) 


I should say that I really opened myself up for her here, and valued her in every way I knew how to. It's been 6 months since we talked, and I want to call her and talk to her (we haven't talked, and I saw her once at a mutual friend's wedding since then). I want to find out the truth, and possibly trying to get back with her and start anew. Really, I'd like to hear your advice on what I should do, whatever it is. Thanks in advance. 

UPDATE: So I decided to call her, not to beg for her to come back, but to see how she was. She talked about how everyone around her was doing well, but didn't bring up the other guy. Thank you to all who responded, I honestly feel like there's nothing there, that she really doesn't care about me, etc. Oh yeah, and coincidentally, the night I called her another girl called me that I've been interested in, came over and had a very enjoyable night. I get to see this new girl again, and I'm glad I'm moving on.

HOWEVER, if you hold a college-type job (retail, waiting tables) for an extended period of time, it is necessary for you to diversify your employment history with volunteer activities, entreprenurial efforts, and internships. 

This may sound like obvious advice to some, but many HR departments will see your long-term employment in a particular field as a career instead of simply a job that you had to have to make ends meet.  Many companies are skeptical of applicants who are making such a career change, because of the learning curve on the new job.

DO NOT exclude these jobs from your resume -- Instead supplement them with alternative training, aforementioned ""side"" jobs or part-time gigs, and play up any ""on the job"" experience you may have that is even remotely similar to the position for which you seek.  

SOURCE: Worked retail for 10 years, had 5 different interviewers / HR Generalists tell me that due to my ""extensive"" experience in retail, they could not offer me a position until I gained experience in my field of study.  I hold an MBA as well as a bachelors degree in communications. 

TL;DR: If you work a long-term college job, don't get locked-in.  Find a position that corresponds to your major field of study even if you have to take a pay cut. 

EDIT: For those curious my major field of study is marketing. You would think this would be congruent with a retail sales job, but it is not.  Never let a retail recruiter convince you otherwise.  "

Carrying my laptop up/down Hearst is not very fun, so I've been looking into buses/shuttles.

I've known of the [H shuttle](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=207072823347146212274.0004b66e0462041827281&amp;msa=0), which goes around from Bart to Lawrence Lab. However, it doesn't run very often, and the number of stops also seem limited. After some googling, I've learned that there's a shuttle for LBNL called [""Blue Uphill/Downhill""](https://www.nextbus.com/predictor/stopSelector.jsp?a=lbl) that runs every 15 minutes. I was wondering if anyone knows whether Cal students can ride this bus, or is it just for the LBNL employees? 

Also, if I want to arrive at the workplace by 8:30 am, what time would be best to leave? I'm thinking 10 mins from Northside to Bart by bus, or 20 mins walking, 25-30 mins on Bart (stop at Montgomerry Station), 10 mins walk to workplace. Together, I think I should leave an hour in advance. How bad/crowded is Bart in the morning?

Apologies if these questions have been asked before, but I'm really nervous about this first internship. After getting some answers, I plan to ""test-drive"" tomorrow by riding whatever bus that goes down to Bart and calculating the time myself.

Thanks!"

I've been asked to create a column that divides customers into four different geographical regions. I had to work with the information I have (their addresses).  So, I decided to use zipcodes to do this. 

So far, I have  created a table with the following:

region, w, x, y, z

max, 10, 20, 30, 50

min, 19, 29, 49, 59

If all of the zipcodes are in column F, and I want the one of the four corresponding regions to show up in column G, what formula should i use?

This is what i have right now, and it's not working:

=IF(F2&gt;=$K$2,F2&lt;$K$3,""LA"", IF(F2&gt;=$L$2,F2&lt;$L$3,""LA"",IF(F2&gt;=$M$2,F2&lt;$M$3,""SD"",IF(F2&gt;=$M$2,F2&lt;$M$3,""SD"",IF(F2&gt;=$N$2,F2&lt;$N$3,""nSoCA"",IF(F2&gt;=$O$2,F2&lt;$O$3,""NOT CAL"", IF(F2&gt;=$P$2,F2&lt;$P$3,""INT"")))))))

I first used and If(AND) Function, but I didn't know how to account for the if not x, then y. That's because the y happens to be several other options.

Like I said, I'm new to using excel, and all the stuff above I've learned through research. Also, could I use a vlookup for this, and if so, how?"

Ich bin ein französicher Student, und absolviere mein Praktikum in einem deutschen Betrieb seit einem Monat (und werde noch für zwei Monate in Deutschland bleiben). Da ich niemand weder in diesem Betrieb noch wo ich lebe kannte, da ich viel Schwierigkeiten habe an den Gesprächen teilzunehmen (die Leute haben hier einen starken Akzent), spreche ich nicht so viel. Und wenn ich spreche, spreche ich über Arbeit. 

Ich möchte nicht nur das technische Vokabular lernen, und mit Leute sprechen, die mir meine Fehler korrigieren, also habe ich mich hier angemeldet, um jemand mit dem zu diskutieren, um meine Sprachkentnisse zu verbessern. Ich kann also Französich zu verbessern beitragen, und nutze Skype jeden Tag. Ich kann auch email tauschen. 

______________________

Hi, 

I'm a french student currently working as an intern in a german company since one months and for another two months. Before arriving, I didn't know anyone here in the company as well as in the city. Since the people here have a strong accent, I hardly can participate to the conversations, and the only times I speak German, I speak about work.

Since I intended to improve my German (and not only my knowledge of the technical vocabulary), I decided after being invited by a friend of mine, to register here. I'm also looking for someone to discuss with and help me become more fluent. In exchange, I can help improving your fluency in French. I daily use Skype and can correspond by mail too.

_______________________

Bonjour, 

Je suis un étudiant Français en stage dans une entreprise allemande depuis un mois et pour deux mois encore. Je ne connaissais personne en arrivant, que ce soit dans l'entreprise ou dans la ville ou je loge. J'ai également du mal à me mêler aux conversations à cause de l'accent des gens. Les seuls moments où je parle c'est pour le boulot. 

Comme j'ai pas envie de n'apprendre que le vocabulaire technique, une amie m'a convaincu de m'inscrire ici, pour chercher quelqu'un avec qui discuter. Je peux aider à améliorer le niveau de français, j'utilise Skype tous les jours et peux si besoin correspondre par mail également."
1fd60q,0,2013-05-30,Honest feedback on recent work please,[deleted],editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1fd60q/honest_feedback_on_recent_work_please/,"Last year, I took a video-editing internship with a company that has a project called, ""[The House of Creatives](http://www.thehoc.com/)"" or ""[The HoC](http://www.thehoc.com/)."" I was to organize and label 6 weeks of footage. The editor they were using dropped out, and I was then contracted to edit a series of music artist interviews.

This is the result of my first editing gig (Best of the worst videos(with no experience)) Austin 2012

There were more videos, but I think you get the idea. Shoddy camera work, amateur equipment, yada yada yada. And at this time, I had just an intermediate grasp of FCP7 and no knowledge of divinci or after effects. 

Apparently, the company that contracted me were pleased with the work, and as they expanded, so did ""The HoC"" project, as well as the amount of work they would throw at me.

I'm still with the company, and we just wrapped up ""[HoC Austin 2013](http://www.thehoc.com/austin2013/)"" and ""[HoC Palm Springs 2013](http://www.thehoc.com/palmsprings2013/)."" We're working with a new production company that uses a RED Scarlet, as well as having a proper workflow. For 4-5 days straight, we would have 3-4 bands per day come perform at a venue, and deliver 1 performance video per band, 1 interview per band. So if 3 bands came to the house on day 1, we would deliver a total of 9 videos within 24 hours. 

This is the result from the recent ""HoC's"" (best of the best) And by this time, I wasn't only editing interviews, I was also tackling performances.

I got accepted into a decent grad program starting Fall 2013. I was told by pretty much everyone that I'd *probably* be given some sort of research task over the summer from the institution. Well, I foolishly followed this advice and didn't apply for any summer internships since I thought I was covered for summer. Well, turns out, I was wrong. I'm a little peeved, but I suppose it was my fault for not making sure earlier.
Some of the reason was due to me having a late graduation date (mid-June). 

So now I'm a little bit worried about what to do for Summer. It's way too late for almost any internships, and the only ones I could find were at my local museums, but not very related to physics. I need to save up some money to move to my grad institution, but I also wanted to get my foot in the door with some research being done by the professors. I even offered to work unpaid and part time and they refused, which I found odd. 

My options seem rather limited now. Do I find a part-time job for only ~7 weeks? Even still, I have bills to pay, unfortunately, so it won't allow me to save any money for moving expenses. I'm a little frustrated at this point and wish I planned out my summer better.

Any advice? Thanks.

I live in a great city but I'm too poor to fully enjoy all it has to offer and that frustrates me SO MUCH. I also can't seem to act like a fucking adult and keep my apartment clean. It's actually dirty, and the only times it gets properly cleaned is when my boyfriend and I team up and do it on our days off - which we rarely have together in the first place because of our jobs being complete opposite shifts. UGH.

Then there's the whole school issue. I've already got a diploma from the most useless school on earth. I was second-best in the class and took an internship that took me nowhere, then I was unemployed for almost a year while joining activist hippie groups and generally hating my life. I wasted my time, took up smoking pot and hating ""the man"", was angry and bitter that my education somehow failed me. When I looked into the competition for my field I was blown away at how little I had been taught, how little education I felt I had received. And in $32K of student debt that I am still pushing aside because I'm living paycheck to paycheck. No way in hell I can afford monthly payments and probably won't be able to for awhile. Part of me wants a refresher course or a do-over but that costs money and right now I'm working full-time, minimum wage at a job that I like but is not related to my field whatsoever - I can't quit or even lessen my hours to go to school because then I can't make rent. I don't want to move back home with my parents because that's a full moving process which also costs money that I don't have.

I lost my driver's license while visiting family for Christmas (my parents scraped up some money to fly me out) - have no idea where the card is, but now I can't exchange my license for a new one in the province in which I currently reside. I have no idea what to do. I don't have a car (thank God because I would not be able to afford it) but I don't want to lose my license because it's nifty to have and I paid all that money for it back in the day. I have no valid form of government-issued photo ID (unless you can count an expired passport) so no bars for me. I try to avoid situations where I will get I.D'd because I don't have any. This rules out a lot of ways to start over socially with new people (bars &amp; nightlife are huge here).

Meanwhile my dog is snoring beside me (she is one of my only distractions from feeling shitty) and my boyfriend is at his lovely salaried job at a great place with great benefits and a gym and an on-site doctor and here I am feeling sorry for myself. I'm just... at the end of my rope... wishing I had some sort of direction. I have a huge problem with procrastination and also not knowing where to look for resources. Guess this is what I get for trying to get away from my hometown and start a new life for myself. 

If anybody lives in southern Quebec and knows how a new-ish resident can get her shit back together, I'm all ears."

I'm an intern at MacPherson Architects and we are currently going over plans to create a pedestrian friendly area on Adams street and bring business/ people back to downtown. As some of you may know, downtown isn't exactly the busiest place in Toledo. In fact it's quite the opposite when there's not a Mud Hens game going on. With all these beautiful high rises sitting vacant it pains me to see so much potential boarded over and hoping for something to come along and move in. We have more open parking lots than we need and a beautiful view of the riverfront from the empty park next to it. 

What I want to know is what do you want to see happen? what could we do to make Downtown more inviting? 

Here are some precedents we've been looking at;

Edit: Before I get all the hopes up this just a proposal I'm making, but we have significant interest from the businesses around here and it seems everyone is on board to see this happen. So the more people that want to make this happen the stronger we can argue for it and actually see this come to fruition.

I have average marks from medical school. The problem is that I'm extremely introverted. During my internship, I have problems showing my knowledge and skills to my supervisors/instructors even though I'm pretty confident about that subject/procedure. This, I believe has hampered my progress a lot. I have found that other senior doctors and other staff have mostly positive impression about me when they have worked with me for a few weeks. But when I move to another department, it's the same story again. Do you have any advice that might help me?

Also, I'm thinking about giving USMLE and I'm confident I can get good scores in Step 1 and 2. But I don't have much research experience, or any published work. I know it's pretty difficult getting into observership programs in the US and so I  have very slim chance of getting good Letters of Recommendations.

I'm a transferring as a junior to CoE from a community college.

I may not be able to attend CalSo, as I just started a summer internship and I may not be able to get time off. If I can't, am I screwed? My registration date would be pushed back to mid-July, rather than early June. Will I have trouble getting into certain classes if I have to wait?

I'm not certain what my schedule will be, but here are a few classes I **might** be taking:

* EE 40 (4) Intro. to Microelectronic Circuits
* EE 20N (4) Structure and Interpretation of Systems and Signals
* CS 70 (4) Discrete Math and Probability Theory
* CS 61AS? (1-4) The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Self-Paced)

**Questions:**

0. How many units should I aim for?

1. Is it a bad idea to take EE 40 and EE 20N at the same time during my first semester?

2. Will I actually have to take 61A or 61AS? It seems to be an introductory programming course, but no equivalent is listed for the CC I'm transferring from. I've taken multiple programming classes, and am working as a software engineering intern right now -- how can I determine whether I'll still have to take either 61A or 61AS?

3. How can I find out which general ed/humanities classes will transfer? assist.org only lists those for the College of Letters and Sciences. The EECS website says which Berkeley courses fulfill those requirements, but not what their equivalents are at my CC.

4. Most of this information is supposed to be made available at CalSo. Where can I clarify these questions if I can't go to CalSo?

5. Do you have any general advice for transfer students? For EECS majors, or CoE students?

Please let me know if I need to clarify anything.

Thanks! I'm incredibly excited about going to Cal."

So I'm starting to come out, a few of my frat bros know, and they're awesome about it. Right now I'm living in our house in the summer and basically none of the guys are around except about 15-20, and I'm out to like 3 of them. Anyway, my old roommate (we lived together this past year) just got here for the summer and he is definitely one of my best friends and I have wanted to come out to him for a few weeks, I was just waiting for him to get back here after going home for a few weeks. Unfortunately, towards the end of the year I started getting very frustrated with him. He does A LOT of drugs, he smokes at least 1-2 times a day if not more and drinks a ton. He decided at the beginning of the semester to stop doing ecstasy, he'd do it every 3 weekends or so, sometimes more. Instead, he started taking acid, and now he almost takes acid once a week and has picked up molly. NOW: there is NOTHING wrong with doing drugs and stuff, I used to smoke weed a ton in HS, however, this kid was literally throwing his life in crazy directions: he'd do little no studying work until two nights before an essay was do/an exam and pull 2-3 all nighters, then get blackout drunk 3 days in a row after. 

Anyway, he has ALWAYS asked me for advice (I'm super into school and try to live a very balanced life, I love getting wasted) about things like ""I have this exam next week, I'm so stressed, what should I do?"" and I'd usually say something like ""Well don't go out four nights in a row this weekend"" or ""Don't smoke every night, just smoke 2 nights and spend the rest studying"" etc, things that should (in my mind) be common sense. He NEVER listened to it, once. So towards the end of the semester, I was just kinda sick and tired of him destroying his body and complaining about school. So, I figured having 2-3 weeks away from him would make me wanna hang around him again, especially since we wouldn't be living together, anymore.

So now that he's back I've been trying to hang out with him (sober, mind you) so I can catch up and such. I literally have not seen him sober for the past week. I wanted to come out to him but at this point I don't even want to bother, he hangs out with weird-ass drug people (never hangs out with the frat anymore, really) and since his internship here (that's why he's living here this summer) hasn't started he spends every moment drinking, smoking, or tripping. My question is, is this something me and some guys should try and intervene with? I mean I've made it clear (or tried to) before that he needs to slow down with everything. Have any of you guys had this problem? Is it even a problem? 

**TL;DR** : I feel like my friend is doing a lot of drugs and does nothing, not sure what I can do about it anymore"

I do struggle with depression and anxiety and sometimes I really wish my brain would just shut off for a while. I'll think that I'd rather be dead sometimes, but they're only quick superficial thoughts. I would never take my own life or harm anyone else. But here is my story...

I graduated college 4 years ago. I got my bachelors degree in business and had a 3.2 GPA. I lack experience on my resume because I was working as well as going to school and never took on an internship. So needless to say I have never gotten a real job/started my career in the 4 years I have been out of school. I applied everywhere. Jobs I was qualified for, under-qualified, over-qualified. And I did not limit myself to any specific area. No luck. Not even a single interview. I am 30k in debt, which all things considered isn't bad compared to a lot of other people. My gf is much worse off as far as debt goes (all from school as well) and she has a religious degree which she regrets because it is useless and because she lost her faith as she grew older. I work full time as a grocery clerk, for the past 3 years and after my bills and rent and food I barely ever have anything left over. I have tried to move up within the company but I basically just get ignored now. Even my HR rep can't get any info from the main HR lady to help me. The majority of the management do not even have college degrees so you would think they would be happy to move me up the chain. 

We planned on moving to somewhere outside of the city we now live in so we could spend less on rent and get a lot more out of our money, but we can't afford to move and if we could we only have one car so it would be hard for us to both have full time jobs and ever see each other. 

Last night I completely broke down when I really realized how stuck we were. Like I said I have always dealt with depression and anxiety, but I hurt so bad last night mentally and emotionally that I didn't want to move or think or even sleep. I just sat here blank. 

I am on my lunch break from work and I have been getting shit on all morning and I knew typing this out would help me calm down a bit. I do not want to go on medication or anything because my mind is strong and I fear that I can lose that power over myself if I am medicated. I don't want to be numbed. At the heart of it I really do enjoy life. I think it is beautiful, but right now I'm struggling to keep pressing forward. I just want a real job so I can live a normal life and stop struggling. So I can marry the girl that I am so in love with and have kids and give them a good life. 

Any advice that any of you can give would be appreciated. Just knowing someone might read this and relate and possibly find strength in knowing they're not alone makes me glad I did this.

tl;dr: I am 26. BS degree in business. Shitty min wage job for 3 years. Can't move up. Can't afford to move to a cheaper area. Barely getting by. Wish I had a career so I could stop struggling and just be happy and enjoy life. debt. shitty cramped apartment. it hurts.

I remember pretty vividly when I arrived in Vermont. It was so different than what I was used to. Mountains were quite unfamiliar to me having grown up in the Midwest, and I was in awe at being constantly surrounded by the beauty of it all. New England Culinary Institute (NECI) was located in Essex Junction, which was very close to Burlington, which was a cool little college town very similar to a college town that I lived near in Iowa. It was just enough familiarity for me to keep me going, seeing as this was quite possibly the boldest and spur of the moment decision of my life to date.

I fell in love with everything Vermont. The local businesses, the food culture, the farmer's market, the mountains, the weather, the microbreweries, and even the people. Except the hippies. I've never liked hippies.

So I moved into the dorms almost the instant I got into town. The dorms were basically converted housed where about 5 people shared a floor, common areas including a bathroom and kitchen, and we got our own bedrooms. Not a bad setup, really. I went to orientation, signed my life away to a student loan company, and began classes.

It was a completely new experience for me. The classes were all strictly hands on learning through cooking. The school was located in a resort with functioning restaurants and banquets halls, so everything that was prepared was ultimately served to a paying customer. Other classroom environments were located in Burlington at a high volume restaurant. It was a great learning experience all around. I was making friends as well, which was something I had worried about having moved away from all of my own friends. I was truly starting anew, having essentially left my entire life behind me. Was I running away from my problems? Absolutely. Was it one of the best decisions of my life? Well, yes and no.

I met a pretty little lady who was in my class. There weren't a whole lot of females in the school, and she was by far the most attractive. I had absolutely no chance with her, so I rarely made more than small talk with her. Well, until one night I got pretty drunk and I saw her in my building. She had been drinking a bit as well, but wasn't really as drunk as I was. I get pretty bold when I drink, so I started talking to her. And, hey, she was even talking back! I asked her for a drink of her beer (she was drinking sweet malt beverage, and I wanted to try it), so she took a big sip, came in to kiss me and spit it into my mouth. I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there.

The next day, she seemed pretty embarrassed about it and apologized for the way she acted. She was a bit of a goody, after all, and wasn't used to acting like that or being around people who acted like that. And then she asked me if I wanted to go out sometime. Score number two! We went out for coffee one night and walked around Church street. I was pretty convinced that it was a bit of a pity date because she felt bad (and also because I'm an idiot and oblivious to when a woman is into me) so I just enjoyed our conversations and our time spent together, took her back to her dorm room, and that was the end of it.

Until a week later, when she was asked out on a date by another guy, and she quite vocally replied to him, ""Well if inquebiss doesn't ask me out again, I might have to go out with you!"" Woah, what? She actually wanted to go out with me again? That's when we started dating for realsies.

So we finished our first year of school. We both went on internships at different restaurants for the summer, but were reunited the following fall. I signed away again at that student loan to attend another year of high end culinary school. Towards the end of the year, I heard rumor that the school was going to offer a Baking and Pastry degree program. Well, that was kind of why I attended culinary school to begin with. Now they have a program that focuses on just those things? Hell yeah! So, after having completed almost all of the required classes to get my Culinary Arts degree, I re-enrolled to attend another year and a half to get my Baking and Pastry degree. Oh, and the nice girl I was dating decided that she wanted to do the same. She wanted to be a cake decorator, after all.

And we signed our life away to the student loan company again.

The new school program was only offered at the other campus, so we had to move down there to attend. We decided to get our own apartment in the next town over having figured out that it was actually cheaper than paying room and board. We spent the next nine months in classes learning all about how to make artisan breads, pastries, deserts, cakes, and chocolate work. 

And after two years of dating, I proposed. Spoiler Alert: She said yes ;)

We finished our classes, but still had another internship to go through. We decided that we wanted to be together, so we tried to get an internship at the same place or places close together. We found a golf and beach resort that would take us both in their pastry kitchen, but it was in Florida. Sure, why the hell not? We were young and adventurous!

We packed up our cars, drove to Florida, found an apartment, and started our internship. We made $9.00 an hour. But we were livin large, because of all the overtime we were working. Being on an internship meant you were still technically enrolled in school, so we weren't paying on our loans yet. We weren't even thinking about them. Just makin money and spending money. The internship ended but we still had a lease on the apartment, so we figured we'd just stay for the rest of the year. We were offered jobs at the site, but the experience we had with the pastry chef was terrible. We jumped ship at the first chance. I landed a job at a pretty sweet beach club for the elite and my fiancee couldn't find a job in pastries, so she worked for Sak's Off Fifth and Victoria Secret. I wasn't doing any baking or pastry work, but I got a really good experience doing high end beach food at the restaurant as well as doing banquets, weddings, and special events. And the location was at one of the most beautiful beaches I've been to. Couldn't ask for much more than that!

Alas, the end of our lease was coming up and we knew the grace period on our student loans would be ending soon, so we began to plan for heading back to New Hampshire, which was where her home town was located. We'd stay with her parents for a bit until we found jobs and could move out. We enjoyed our stay in Florida, but we were definitely ready to leave. So the time came, we packed up our cars again, and made our way back to New England.

We both started looking for jobs right away and my fiancee applied to a high end pastry shop that she had dreamed of working at. It was her inspiration for attending culinary school. And she got the job! But she was only making $8.00 an hour. Temporarily, hopefully. I found a great job at a very nice artisan bread bakery making $10.00. The downside was that it was just outside of Boston, which was an hour and a half drive each way. But, I needed a job and I wanted it to be in that specific field, so I did it. It took a few months for us to both start working, but we got it in. And good thing too, because we got our first student loan bills in. 

Her's was about $1000 and mine was up around $1200. 

Yup. Having attended the most expensive culinary school in the country, I owed about $100,000, and she owed just under that. I was making less per hour than what I was before I started school. What in the hell were we going to do?"

So after being out of grad school for a year, I FINALLY found a position! (Woohoo! there's hope after all!) It's an internship, but I'm getting paid and the position is exactly what I want. My boss even basically said that by the end of the year I'll probably be a full time member of the team. There's a major need within this company for someone with my skills/talent, so I know I'm going to have a good time fitting in.

Now... the place I'm working is very new to me. It's very small (only about 7-8 people work there), and the attitude is very relaxed and collaborative. So far my job is to gather information and create sort of a knowledge base for both people in the company and for clients. I figured the easiest way to do this is to write blogs about different processes and post them on the company website (they're very active with their blogs).

The only problem is that I went to a very prestigious school, where everything had to be written in a very strict, essay format. I also did an internship during school with the government - where nothing can be written in a personal voice, and everything has to go through various levels of management before it's approved. I'm having trouble finding my ""voice"" as a blogger, and revealing the person behind the words (so to say). I'm not comfortable writing ""I"" and revealing things about myself through my work.

Any tips on writing blogs? Or becoming more relaxed in the workplace? Also, do you have any blogs you read regularly that has a style you like?

tl;dr: how do I reveal my personality through my blog? (and yes - actually, writing this reddit post helped me learn a few things about talking about myself, but this is still anonymous so it's not as scary)"

* I have a job offer for a 12 week Software Engineering internship in the US
* I don't have a Bachelor's degree but I have 3 years completed.
* I have 2 years of work experience in my field.
* I can't get a J-1 visa because I need to be a full-time student at the time I apply but I just finished an internship.


With this in mind it seems like my only option is to go for the Sci/Tech category in the TN, but I would like to know what my chances are for getting passed the border.


Is there a way of describing a software engineering position to make it sound more suitable for this category?


Lastly, how does it work? Would I need to buy a plane ticket and then go for the interview, risking that it would be denied, and thus losing my ticket?

Please help!,muddyalcapones,Wordpress,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fc82k/im_new_to_wp_and_am_having_an_issue_with_sidebars/,"Hi r/Wordpress. I started last week as an intern at a county planning office and I'm having trouble getting some things to work properly on the website. I've used WYSIWYG editors before, but never Wordpress, and I'm having trouble finding solutions through google.

The basic problem is this: On many pages on the site such as [this one](http://www.ccrpcvt.org/transportation/) there is a sidebar on the left-hand side (transportation planning activities) that is inside of the main content ""box"", but we would like it to sit outside to the left.
Is this doable?

The second issue is very confusing. That sidebar mentioned above is embedded with php code. I put the code in at the top of the html viewer and it seems to work fine, but if I go back in later for any reason to change text or content on the page, the php code disappears and I'm left with this shell:

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr valign=""top""&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;THIS IS WHERE THE PHP CODE WAS&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;

This is problematic because it means that anytime we edit a page with php code (most of them) we have to make sure the last thing we do is to re-add the code.

Thanks for any help, people!

1fc7zi,5,2013-05-30,"Long distance, long-term relationship worth fighting for? [23/F] and [26/M]",bjorns_free,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fc7zi/long_distance_longterm_relationship_worth/,"I met Jai two years ago online while doing an internship in another city. It was my first experience with online dating, and I wasn't expecting to actually meet anyone in person, but we really hit it off and had a great three months there. He's a talented, sensitive, altruistic person whom I share many values with. At that point, I could really see us going places. Even in our difficult times later on, we've grown together. I met and love his family, and they really liked me; my parents weren't that thrilled, but they never are. He knew from the beginning that I was leaving for another state for a teaching job for at least two years, and we decided to try long distance.  

The training for my teaching job that summer and the entire first year after that were awful. I was stressed beyond self-recognition, and I definitely took it out on him. He also didn't understand anything about what I was going through, and I had a hard time communicating that to him. He would make it seem like there were simple solutions to the issues that I was having, and it would frustrate me. Things would escalate quickly, like if I was ranting and swearing about a work-related issue, he would yell at me about ""swearing at him."" I didn't feel like he was a support and added to the emotional burden that I carried from my job. He would say that he was supportive because he'd stay up with me many times while working, which is true, but he has usually used that fact to hold that over my head in arguments. We also had intimacy issues. I was so unhappy and overworked that I had no drive, and he would tell me that I made him feel unattractive and like I didn't want him.  

During that time, I also became close to a male coworker who empathized with me rather than criticized me. While I did develop some feelings for the coworker, I didn't act on them, but it strained my relationship with Jai that year nonetheless. This year, it has been a non-issue as we don't even see or speak to each other much anymore, but Jai still seems suspicious that there is someone else in my life.  

That first year, I only saw Jai once for a few days during Christmas. He lives with his parents, and I didn't have a good time with him; he seemed hostile towards his family, and because I didn't feel comfortable getting intimate in his parents' home, he was even more upset about the lack of intimacy.  

When I returned to work, I was back in survival mode and didn't think too much about our relationship except for putting out the fires that developed. When summer came around, I wanted out. I wanted to focus on getting better at my career and getting away from other stressors. I cried so much and had a lot of trouble articulating myself, and Jai's vitriol made everything worse. He accused me of cheating him of a chance to see what my life was like, since he had planned on coming to my state and maybe even getting a job here. Jai also accused me of ""emotional rape"" and being cold when I was trying to cut contact. I don't recall how, but we wound up getting back together after a week, agreeing that I wanted to focus on my work but that we could still be together.  

That summer I visited him, and things seemed better. He also came to visit at the beginning of the new school year, when I was still extremely stressed. I continued to express my frustration and wasn't interested in being intimate, and it made him resent me. He told me that my job was harder than he thought it was, which made me resent him. After he left and as the year went on, things seemed to improve as we took the time we needed to do our respective things and still spend some time talking together on Google Chat, the phone or texting. I've made a much greater effort towards intimacy, too.  

That being said, I still didn't see our futures melding. I don't know how long I want to stay in my current state and teach, and I don't want to live in the city where he and his family are. What I wanted to do was spend the summer together and then start talking about the inevitable. I'd been avoiding the future talk for some time, when a few nights ago Jai insisted on talking about it. He was looking for assurance, but I told him that I couldn't promise anything. He said that my indecisiveness was hurting him, so I told him that I would then need to let him go. He started backtracking, saying that he didn't need an exact answer, saying that he wanted to work things out. Then he said he wasn't going to let me break up with him. That he wanted to see me grow as a person and go to grad school, etc. Then he turned around and said he felt like committing suicide (I told him that I'd call the police if he kept talking like that, and he stopped), that he'd ruined his standing in his community with his relationship with me and would be doomed to be alone without me (we're an interracial couple). I ended the call with us both crying and feeling incredibly guilty.  

The next night we spoke again and Jai told me again that I gave up easily on relationships, that he thought I understood his culture and it was my fault, that everything could be worked out and I wasn't trying hard enough. I stood my ground this time the way I hadn't the year before, and we're broken up.  

I think I'd be willing to work things out if we were physically together and had therapy, but I don't know. I've seen comments on Reddit about girls in their early twenties wanting to find themselves, and there's some truth to that (although he'd told me age was no excuse that first night). I told him that last night and he said he wanted to look into online counseling. I said I'd think about it. My mom thinks he's emotionally abusive and that I'm crazy for considering it. How about you, Reddit? (Thank you for even reading. It helps to write it all out.)

**TL;DR I've been dating a man long distance for 2 years after meeting online and being together for 3 months. After I moved, our relationship tanked because of a lack of communication and stress. Things are better now, but I'm not sure if I should walk away because our futures don't seem to mesh well.**"

Also, I currently work at a bakery (I was going to learn baking, etc but an opportunity came up to go back to school, so I'm just doing the bakery clerk thing for right now, but making decent money for a retail position in a small business). I am thinking about trying to find a different part time job or internship while I'm going back to school. I need some ideas as to what I might be qualified for and what positions might help me get my foot in the door. I was even thinking as far as going to certain places that are hiring full time accounting assistants (which I'm not qualified for because I don't have an associate's degree in accounting and no real world experience) and asking for an internship. Anyone tried that bold move?


I was also wondering how I can get experience in Quickbooks or other things to help build my resume...do classes in these specific softwares help? (I have experience in Excel and other Microsoft Office programs, looking to broaden my competency in accounting software).

Is there another subreddit I can post this to?

They will rarely tell you to stop emailing them. I remember sending an email stating that I had registered for classes. It had literally nothing to do with the actual internship other than the fact I was taking my first Biochem class. Find a way to bug them so much they know your name...

Secondly, connections are everything. From the beginning, or wherever you are in your studies, find a professor or someone with power who you mentor you. Drain their brain for whatever information they can impart. At worst they will get annoyed and pass you on to another professor. It is the effort that counts and YOU WILL BE NOTICED.

Third, take it upon yourself to acknowledge the importance of your classes. No one can give you the hunger you need to succeed in class. This is solely on your shoulders. You can come up with excuses regarding your dad being an addict, your girlfriend sucking up your time, but at the end of the day they are just that... excuses. Always remember, your grades reflect your interest in the subject and any employer or grad school will see that. 

Overall, I hope that my few words of advice can help someone out there. My dad engrained these notions in my mind from a young age and I have been quite successful at my age of 20. 

Thank you for your time."

I'll probably finish reading *Code Complete* and start with *Effective C++* next, maybe *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, too. 

I want to learn more about C++ and become a better developer in general. What other books should I tackle? If you were in my position how would you structure you're learning? 

45 hours/week for 2 months is a lot of time, I want to use this time for study rather than get involved in a project. I can probably get through several large books, so while I have the chance I want to fill my head with good practices and useful knowledge.

1fbqi6,2,2013-05-30,Graduate School For History or Law School?,GuthanBrawl,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fbqi6/graduate_school_for_history_or_law_school/,"I'm currently a senior, although I'll expect to graduate in about two years because classes at my univ are slim pickings.  Anyway, I currently have a 3.81 gap(I'm trying my damn hardest to hit the 3.9 mark just to get summa cum laude recognition).  I'm majoring in history with a minor in Russian.  I should also note that I have not taken or practiced for either the LSAT or GRE.  However, I've read up on their format and know their style of questions.  I've also been a pretty strong standardized test taker.  That's not to say that I'll get the highest score, but rather that I'm very good at taking tests and thinking under pressure.


I've had this internal struggle between law and graduate school after college.  The more I think about it the more I feel as if I'm stuck at a fork in the road.  I do have a deep interest in law, specifically criminal law.  I've taken some pre-law(crim pro, con. law) courses at my school and my professors have told me that my thought process is perfect for law since I have great memory and can think on my feet.  I also really enjoy studying history.  I can easily see myself working as a historian.

Now, one of the main reasons I can't decide is because careers have a fairly poor employment outlook.  I cannot see myself doing anything really that isn't academically related or isn't related to law.  (Note: I've interned at law firms and assisted with legal research and writing.  Currently, I'm a university-sponsered internship where I work with a museum curator researching Soviet history and artwork.  So I've had some exposure to both of my dream fields.  How should I go about this, Reddit?   After speaking to several friends and professors, I've learned that in graduate school I have a much better chance of getting a PhD debt free(or close to it), while in law school I'm pretty much guaranteed at least $150K+ debt unless I qualify for an immense scholarship."

I'm not sure if this is the right place to do this but I have a few questions.. A little background about myself:

* 3rd year economics major at UC Irvine
* Plan on graduating Fall Quarter (December '13)
* No experience/internships with any departments

UCI has a CSO program which I could apply for, but one of the requirements is that I have a FULL academic year left at UCI (and even then, some people hear back 2 years later so it's no guarantee that I'll get in).

I've been asking around at a few departments in the area, but most prefer Social Ecology majors (such as criminal justice or psych) and give them preference for internships.

So my questions are:

1. Are there any other possible ways to get myself ready/become a better candidate?
1. How soon before graduating should I begin applying?
1. Is there anything I should begin preparing? (Aside from being physically fit).

Thank you!"

**3,092 American Idiots** for **1 year**.

Green Day is surely a name that most of you recognize. The group has been constantly releasing various very recognizable songs for the longest amount of time, which are world-renowned today. I mean, who hasn't heard of ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams""? And guess what, that song has been released *nine* years ago, at which point they have long established themselves as one of the leading rock bands of its time.

What is now one of the most important punk bands of the past two decades began as a duo between the two childhood friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike ""Dirnt"" Pritchard at age 15. After having adopted the name ""Green Day"", the group released numerous well-known albums to the likes of ""Dookie"" and ""American Idiot"" that ensured their rise to mainstream popularity. The group now has four regularly appearing members, which are the aforementioned Billie Joe Armstrong (Guitar, Vocals), Mike Dirnt (Bass, backing vocals), and the later joining Tré Cool (Drums) and Jason White (Guitar, backing vocals)

It is thus no wonder that a small branch of its fanbase have found themselves on Reddit, where they gathered themselves in a small, yet active sub, under the control of three mods, who are the founder /u/Garin2010, and his two minions, /u/MispelledName and /u/Slapdown, whom I was able to ask some questions:


&gt;1\. What brought you into listening to Green Day?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I discovered Green Day just as I was also becoming acquainted with other bands like The Offspring and Rage Against the Machine. American Idiot was given to me as a gift from a family member after it was released in 2004 and I immediately became a fan. From then on I moved on to listening to their entire catalogue and have been following the band ever since.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** I actually got into Green Day because I saw them in the ""Thank You"" area of a lot of albums, especially my then-favorite band Good Charlotte (I was 14 at the time, don't judge). I kept hearing all of my favorite pop-punk bands saying that they were their inspiration in interviews, and it was love at first listen.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** I started listening to Green Day when American Idiot came out. I heard Holiday on the radio and loved the song, so I went out and bought the album and loved the entire thing. A couple of years went by and I saw the music video for 21st Century Breakdown on MTV and loved that song too so yet again, I went and bought the album. That was when I went back and looked up all their older songs and I knew then that they were my favorite band and still are to this day.

&gt;2\. Which one is your favorite album?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** As much as I would like to say that I have a number one favorite, I usually break down into selecting two. My first is Warning, I love the acoustic sounds of the album and also how it became the album that signified much of Green Day's style changing from their punk days, to the much more modern rock sound that we hear today. The second album is Insomniac, for it's raw sound and punk roots. It's one of those albums that I point to when anyone objects to their punk beginnings.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** My favorite album is American Idiot, because it was the album that got me into Green Day, and actually got me interested in playing guitar and bass. I've always loved concept albums, and you can't go wrong with crunchy guitar and well thought out lyrics.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** My favorite album would have to be 21st Century Breakdown because I love the music on the album and the lyrics. They just hit that spot we all have when listening to our favorite albums. I also tie that album in to being why I looked up all their previous records.

&gt;3\. What was your favorite experience with Green Day?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** My favorite Green Day experience was undoubtedly my first concert. I saw them in 2009 on their 21st Century Breakdown tour in Salt Lake City. I was a Verizon customer at the time and they hooked me up with free tickets, soundcheck passes, early access to the venue, the whole VIP treatment. I was extremely lucky to have such an awesome experience at my first concert, and I still consider it one of the best days of my life.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** My favorite Green Day experience is when I saw them on the American Idiot Tour in Dallas back in '05. I was right on the rail at the very front, and got to high five all of the guys. I even got a water gun blast right in the face from Billie Joe (No, that is not a euphemism).

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** My favorite Green Day experience I've had would be learning and playing the songs on guitar. My girlfriend inspired me to pick up guitar again and learn the songs about 2 years ago. I've been ""Having a Blast"" ever since!

&gt;4\. What motivated you to create the sub?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I created the sub about a year and some months ago after coming on to other band centric subreddits like /r/blink182, and also the fact that I felt that Green Day fans needed somewhere on Reddit to get together and discuss after seeing comments in Green Day posts get so hostile in other subreddits.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** I'm so glad Garin created this sub, he's done a great job with it. Back when I first joined reddit, this was the first sub I looked up and it had barely any posts. Now, it's become a really great community.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** Garin has done an awesome job with the subreddit so far. Keep it up bossman!

&gt;5\. Do you wanna say anything to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I love the fact that our subscribers are very active! And if you ever see a helpless person lost in an /r/music thread, direct them to the sub! Also, there are going to be a number of changes happening that I think many will like.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** We have some pretty great posters, the only thing I really have to say is keep being awesome guys! Keep that good content coming! AND USE THE DAMN [MERCH] TAG!

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** All I want to say to the present and future subscribers is: You guys are the reason the subreddit is awesome, keep it up!

To finish this up, since I'm a new intern at /r/subredditoftheday, I would like to introduce myself:

My universal username is schampanes (shum-pun-ase), and I've had it for as long as I can remember. I've been on Reddit for just over a year now, following the path of one of my IRL friends, who introduced me to the site. I don't have a lot to say about myself, other than the fact that I like music of any form (which is the inspiration for this post), so I might be leaning more towards featuring music-oriented subreddits (or not, who knows?). 

Also, GreyWriter is the sexiest writer of all. ^(Now please put that gun away)"

After a while, with management changes and head office shuffling, he ended up having no responsibilities and no one above him to report to.


The story goes on how he shows up all day and does nothing.  After a while he creates jobs for himself like being in charge of safety but ultimately he still does absolutely nothing most of the time.


A couple of times he almost gets caught, but he is saved by a well timed phone call or by jumping out of his window.  


The story peaks when the author finds someone else in his company (nationwide) that has the same job title as himself.  He works up the nerve and calls the other guy, and they have an uncomfortable conversation until they both admit that neither of them do anything.


I pretty much just retyped most of the story, but Id like to find it again just for a laugh.

I'm hoping to move to London this October... just wondering what the employment scene is like there? I've just completed a 6 month internship in Shanghai as a copywriter and I would love to carry on in this line of work. I have plenty of similar experience and an MA in Creative Writing, and I was also offered a full time job here, but I had to to turn it down as I need to return to the UK.

Anyway I can't help but shake this nagging feeling I made a mistake turning the full time job down... but what can you do I guess when you want to return home. Do you think finding work in London would be too hard?"

I have a Kershaw Tanto Blur [link here](http://kershaw.kaiusaltd.com/knives/knife/tanto-blur) that I carry everyday. I'm moving to Washington D.C. this Friday for the next 3 months for an internship and am interested in knowing whether this knife is legal to carry. 

I've read up on a variety of sources but they seem to come to no firm conclusion besides that it ""might"" be legal as long as my intent isn't to hurt or kill anybody with it, which, naturally, it isn't. The knife is about 3.75 inches, black and has SpeedSafe opening, which seems to be legal according to several court cases since it is just an assist opening but is not a button or any type of action that conceals a blade in a grip that could be considered a switchblade. In my home state in the Midwest it is certainly legal! I only mention the color since it seems D.C. has some ambiguous laws about a knife's ""purpose"" and function.

Thanks a lot!"

tomorrow morning i have an interview at a shop rite for a book keeping position.  i am currently studying professional accounting during college and figured this would be a good summer job before i try to get an internship next summer (i previously worked at a golf course the last two summers doing maintenance).  

I was wondering what knowledge i should brush up on before the interview and what types of questions might be asked.  I've never had a position like this before so i don't really know what to expect, but they already have my resume and stuff and told me to come in.  

Also, just wondering, what type of wage do book keepers get?

I've heard that financial accounting 101 as a course is enough to get you into book keeping, is this true?"

&gt;I got a few requests asking if I could make some posters for their state and others asking if they could have one for themselves or to send to their loved ones overseas.

&gt;My project “HOME” is a combination of the two. I want to fill all 50 states (plus DC) with things that make it special and makes locals call it “Home.” 

&gt;I’m trying to raise $12,000. Most of it will cover print production costs which include postcards, posters, polaroids, pictures and photo books.

&gt;The rest of it will cover gas and unforeseen car troubles (plane tickets are at my own expense). I plan on couch surfing, camping, car living and doing the occasional AirBnB if the room is interesting and cheap (I once AirBnB’ed on a boat in Maine for much cheaper than the nearby Hilton and got a presumably much better experience and met a fine couple and their two nice pets that shed everywhere).

I am an avid cyclist, hiker, surfer and love being outdoors. School (I'm in my 3rd year of college) and work kept me inside and my eating habits didn't change so I gained weight. When I stepped on the scale a few months after my 21st, I realized that was pushing 190 and that really bothered me. So in mid-April I began eating less, more nutrient rich foods (Usually around 1800 calories per day) and began running and a circuit workout 5 days a week.

I found a circuit workout coupled with a run provided the ideal mixture of moderate and intense exercise, and the circuit can all be done at home.  My run is usually 3 miles, and the circuit is:

**Four Rounds of:**

15 Pushups

25 Sit-ups

30 Squats (Body Weight only)

30 Lunges (Body Weight only)

25 Dips

1 minute of planks

*When I am home for summer I will have a pullup bar and I intend to add them to my regimen.*

As of today they officially fit, and I dont start for another 3 weeks. My hope is to be down a few more pounds and to tone more before my first day of work.


Thanks for all of the inspiration, advice, and encouragement. You guys are great. I will provide pictures in a few weeks, I forgot to take a starting picture, so there isn't much to show at the moment.

Eventually I started enjoying the classes. I really enjoyed learning the theoretical aspects of it, and all the amazing things people have figured out over the years. But I find the actual 40+ hour weeks of programming to be soul-crushing. At least in the two internships I've had I did. I absolutely HATE having to go through someone else's confusing uncommented code and figure out what the hell is going on so I can fix some bug. I hate having hours go by where I have nothing external to show for it, even though I have been running a mental marathon trying to figure out what the problem is with the code in front of me. 

At one of my internships, I feel like I basically bullshitted my way through most of it. It just felt like there was so much information to take in and I didn't quite grasp what all the different applications were doing. It seemed like some of the other interns picked up on it right away. I know I'm not stupid, but unfortunately computers really are not a passion of mine. So even though I can write software and I really appreciate the art of good software design, I don't know all the ancillary computer stuff that most cs guys seem to know because they really like computers. I see some people who I can just tell belong in cs and wouldn't belong anywhere else, and unfortunately I'm just not that person. I can write software, but it's just not a passion of mine. Although I did really love it the one time I worked on creating a project of my own. But anytime I have to sit down and work on the same boring financial application for a month straight, I start to die a little.

Can anyone else relate to my feelings, and if so did you ever find a cs job that you ended up really liking? And if so, what was it? Any advice?"

But my main concern is that I'm still in college and have commuted since freshman year. I'm out now and I want to be out away from my parents. My dad never was a witness but my mom still is. There was a lot of tension in my household growing up...

I told my parents that I'm going to be moving out and getting an apartment. I have the money. It's going to be a lot but I think it's going to be worth it. I'm really tired of spending 2+ hours a day on the train and being so left out. It sucks when you barely have friends at school and your'e afraid to talk to them/get closer to them because you're told you shouldn't. I just want to go out and enjoy making friends for fucking once...
Then I feel like I'm just being childish. People always look down on younger kids for being childish and bitchy. I can't help but feel now I'm feeling the same way. My mom is telling me to ""be more patient"" and just stay home until I graduate and that I have plenty of opportunities to be independent...but how the fuck am I going to make friends? I'm on an internship right now and it's fucking depressing how stale my routine is. I can't imagine my life being this way in the future. Fuck all of this. fuck. It's so hard to contain the anger.

I made this schematic from a device I took apart (I didn't design/build it). The inductor is actually a solenoid. Also, above the R5 sense resistor, there is a wire that connects to a sensor (to show you how many amps are going through the solenoid).

A few questions:

What's the point of the 2N2222? Why not just drive the base of the 2N3055 directly?

What's the point of THREE sense resistors in series when only one is being used to take a voltage reading off of (above R5 like I said)?

Isn't it shady, the fact that I could put 12V onto my 2N2222? The potentiometer is 0-5k...and according to the datasheet I have, 5V is the max. rated EB voltage... I think the guy who designed this may have been an idiot.

Any additional information you give me would be great. I'm doing an internship and this is my first time doing any real circuit stuff outside of school. This circuit is put together pretty shittily so I wouldn't be surprised if there are some poor design choices.

It's also possible I messed up creating the schematic...

I'm sorry if I just missed it, let me know!

1. How do I go about asking clinics or hospitals if I can do a few days or a week of job shadowing? I'd like to do this to finally decide if this is what I really want to do before dedicating myself. All the other posts I've seen about this are people who know this is what they want or they're already in school for it.

 Should I call and ask? Go in? Who do I ask to talk to? When is the best time to call? Should I have a resume ready even though I have no prior animal related experience? Also, I have a full time job already, can I do a few hours at a time or just a few Saturdays and Sundays?
 
 **EDIT**: The hospital I'm thinking would be best is 24 hr emergency animal hospital and specialty center in Boise, ID. Their website states they're a teaching hospital that does internships for vet school graduates. Idk if any of that information helps but... there it is.

2. As far as education goes, I've only taken a few college general classes (mostly English, Psych 101, Algebra, etc.) at various community colleges. Unfortunately my strong point is not math. If I decided I wanted to become a vet tech, how much will that hinder me? What types of math would I be doing on a daily basis in this career? 

**UPDATE!** 
I'll be doing some job shadowing at a 24hr animal hospital at the end of the week, then the 18th and 21st at a smaller 9-6 clinic later this month. I'll do another post after to let you guys know how it went (if anyone is interested?) "

The only internship I was able to snag was basically IT work at a small manufacturing company. I don't do anything related to CS, and the most 'coding' I do is writing a few simple shell scripts here and there. My days are mostly filled with installing/updating Win7 on machines and helping people with mostly trivial problems.

Will an internship such as this basically close the doors to getting interviews for junior software developer positions at good companies (from large ones like Microsoft and Google to the small firms all over)? Or will I still be able to have a shot at this. I absolutely despise this menial I.T. work, and only accepted this (min wage+$1) internship as it was the only offer I received (I started looking relatively late)."

You were all business and no nonsense. Despite my efforts at flirtation, you ignored my advances, keeping everything strictly clinical as you checked my blood pressure, my lungs, my eyesight...I kept myself in good shape, so I had nothing to be ashamed of. I had hoped the state of my body would loosen you up a bit, but you kept rolling along like I was just another piece of meat.

But when it came time to remove my gown for the final part of the examination, and your eyes fell down to my less-than-impressive cock, the one part of my body that no amount of exercising could ever help, I finally saw you crack a wry smile...

I'm coming to Atlanta for 4 weeks for a medical school rotation at Emory University Hospital Midtown starting Monday.

I went on Craigslist for weekly rentals for housing about a month ago and found a pretty decent place in Decatur for 125$ a week. I paid a deposit right away to confirm a room and text the landlord a week ago to confirm that there is still a room. I was told yes. 

I was all packed and ready to go this morning and thought I'd send another text to the landlord to tell him that I'm coming. I was pretty shocked when he told me that he actually doesn't have the room since he's not sure if the previous tenant is going to move out.  

I tried a few extended stay hotels around midtown Atlanta but all of them are booked full. I went on Craigslist again to try to find other places but no one is picking up their phones (I guess since it's because its Friday afternoon?). 

My internship starts Monday and now I've got the weekend to find a place to stay. People of Atlanta, can anyone help me out?

Thanks!

My cousin is fucked up. He's been taking a shit ton of drugs and hasn't bathed in MONTHS. Apparently his hands are dirty as fuck and disgusting and you could smell him from a distance.

He takes horse sedatives or something and LSD and whatever other hard drugs.

Last week he overdosed and was in the hospital and they would not tell his parents which fucking hospital he was in so his parents had to call all over until they found him. 

He's pissy and angry and doesn't want to talk to anyone especially now that he's at home for a few days since he can't get drugs and is probably going through withdrawal.

I dunno how he's still passing classes at MIT.

Even on some student suicide watch.

He's disgusting.

Sure I don't like his parents much and they did kinda force him to be a good student all the time and fucked him up probably a bit. But they're not so bad that they really deserve this at all. They barely sleep and only look at the computer screen and hope to see in IM say he's online and even then he refuses to talk to them most of the time. His mom works at a factory and has fucked up her hands which have needed multiple surgeries just so her son could afford MIT. I feel awful for them. 

Honestly I just want to go over to his house and beat the shit out of him. I want to grab my siblings who live in different states and bring them here so we could all together host a violent intervention because what the fuck?

Man, it's hard to think about. This is the same cousin that cried when I called him a bastard for the first time. The same cousin that started to cry when I ripped the dreamcast controller from his hands because he fucking sucked at Sonic Adventure 2. The same cousin that I was always jealous of because he was smarter and more social than me and everyone only knew me as ""Kevin's cousin"" and yet despite all that he still helped me on school work and such (despite me being in a higher grade...). He took Valedictorian in high school and for fuck's sake he's going to MIT and already done some internships at microsoft and going back in 10 days. MY only cousin.

And yet now he's this...

If by any chance my cousin Reddit's and reads offmychest or people who know him I got this to say...

Fuck you. You're fucking disgusting. I want to fucking punch your teeth in. You're probably still a good person since you cared a lot about the MIT officer who was killed but for *fucks* sake, Kevin you need some punches to the fucking face.


On another note:

I'm very anti-drug compared to uh... a lot of Reddit. Sorry. But this is family, you know? Burns me right the fuck up."

I already lift 5 days out of every week. I have no real problems of social anxiety. If anything I can be overtly confident/arrogant. I WAS a social pariah until last summer, but I started sarging and since then my social skills have skyrocketed and are improving with most new people I meet. I don't play videogames.

Thought I'd do this over summer along with several other things. 7 days in. I've had 4 or 5 very strong urges to succumb but I'm still going strong. I'm just trying to think - what's the point?
This may be rationalizing it, but I'm not breaking down, I held a diet without lapses for months (losing 20kg) so I clearly have self-control.

If anything I would like to accelerate my learning, set up my own business, become a better conversationalist and expand my social circle - but these need to solved by introspection, experience and serendipity. None of these have I seen mentioned in the NoFap forum.

Might continue this just for the hell of it for 60 days - worth trying it out. But it can be frustrating having the stress of this PLUS a diet (cutting after a bulk) PLUS having a lot of free time due to summer.

Doubt I'll be going out much (or at all) with friends over summer, hopefully I'll get an internship at a bank. Otherwise I'm just going to spend summer improving myself - learning programming, reading, thinking about how to set up a business, public speaking, interning, cooking and setting up my application for University. NoFap may just prove an annoyance/distraction.

What do you guys think?

QUESTION:: any suggestions for meeting new people? I've found that meeting new people really improves my social skills and conversation, whilst meeting friends/people from my school doesn't help much or at all. I'm thinking of learning dancing like the salsa or tango

Hi, I'm a french student currently working as an intern in a german company since one months and for another two months. Before arriving, I didn't know anyone here in the company as well as in the city. Since the people here have a strong accent, I hardly can participate to the conversations, and the only times I speak German, I speak about work. Since I intended to improve my German (and not only my knowledge of the technical vocabulary), I decided after being invited by a friend of mine, to register here. I'm also looking for someone to discuss with and help me become more fluent. In exchange, I can help improving your fluency in French. I daily use Skype and can correspond by mail too.


Furthermore, I'm going to spend one year to study in Canada (Sherbrooke), and I'd like to practise my English before I go there, and maybe, create contacts in Canada or in the USA to travel a little bit.
I like to talk about music, films, mangas/animes or cooking (but also literature(fantasy, crime fiction, novel or poetry), science or arts in general even if I don't know a lot about it and if I mostly read/have French references).

Bonjour, Je suis un étudiant Français en stage dans une entreprise allemande depuis un mois et pour deux mois encore.

Je peux aider à améliorer le niveau de français, j'utilise Skype tous les jours et peux si besoin correspondre par mail également.


De plus, je vais partir étudier un an au Canada (à Sherbrooke) et j'aimerais améliorer mon anglais avant d'y arriver, voire éventuellement me créer des contacts au Canada anglophone ou aux Etats-Unis pour pouvoir voyager. Mes centres d'intérêts sont la musique, les films, les mangas ou animes et la cuisine (je peux aussi parler de littérature (fantasy, polar, roman, poésie), de science et d'art en général, mais je ne m'y connais pas beaucoup même si j'aime bien, et n'ai presque que des références françaises)."

I'm a computer science student and, as a part of my program, my school arranges a few internships for me. After a few of these internships, I've realized that I don't really want to have a career in computer science, whether it be as a developer or something else. I just don't find it very satisfying and honestly can't see myself doing it day in and day out. I know some of you might think that I should only study things that interest me and so forth so, to that extent, I can say that computer science interested me a lot before I started my degree, and it still does, but just not to a level where I can see myself doing it as a career.

One of my internships has been in a finance job working in middle office. (I'm purposely not giving away specifics but can try and clarify certain things if people have questions.) My question for you, /r/finance, is what career options do you think are available to me? The way I see it, I have 3:

1) Go back to that position for my remaining internships (if possible) and try to get a job there post-grad. After that, continue to climb the corporate ladder.
2) Work for a few years post-grad and get an MBA, which will hopefully land me a career I like better (but obviously there's no guarantee).
3) Try and go back to my finance internship position full-time and get a CFA. The only career I know I can have as a CFA (that I normally couldn't otherwise have) is being a Portfolio Manager, which I don't know much about but am currently exploring as well.

She had a brief convo with the mentor afterwards (the mentor found out she got fired from her then boss) and the mentor was pretty ticked. What can she do now to repair the relationship? The job was at a museum and it's a tight knit community - the mentor would have been her primary reference as she went forward."

She ended up getting all of the money by speaking in her church and basically begging everyone she's ever met. 

I find this extremely annoying. $5,000 could feed a lot of people. But it's obviously more important to send someone on a 2 month vacation to Russia. I'm wondering if I suddenly became Christian again if church people would pay for my ""missions"" trip (read: summer abroad to Ireland) next summer! 

Did anyone get vacation money from church in their past? I know my dad and brother got a free trip to Ecuador a few years ago (to be honest, I helped fund it because I knew my dad was dying to go). But I never got a free vacation out of god-worship. "

So there are two directories, lets just call them archive1 and archive2. Archive2 is full of raw files that we get from another company, and archive1 has the raw files that have been ""cleaned."" This happens by running the files in archive2 through a program called cleaner.py and outputting them to archive1. The raw files in archive2 do not get deleted. Now Im supposed to write a script that checks to see which files in archive2 havent been cleaned and then run them through the cleaner program.

Good morning, OMC. 

As a follow up to a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ercmt/reddit_please_help_what_do_i_do/) I wrote weeks ago, I was offered the internship, but I need a letter of acknowledgement because it's unpaid and legalities, etc. I was told to get it from an IT (computer science) professor, advisor, office of admissions, etc. 

Despite emailing all of those people, only my professor responded / picked up my calls and - phew - said he'd write it. But as of right now, I still have no letter. I even sent him the layout the internship said was what they needed (they literally sent me a fill in the blank letter for my professor, which really just required him to put his name and sign it). 

He's a nice guy, but he puts off things for way too long. For example, in his class, our homeworks from the beginning of the semester weren't graded until the very end in a rush. 

At first, I dropped little emails and reminders, but then it turned into a once a day memo of ""pleaseeee, I really want to do this and it'll advance my career, etc."".

Edit: He just sent me a looonnnggg email explaining how he couldn't do it because it's an exam day and basically told me to try someone else, after waiting a week and a half.

Da ich niemand weder in diesem Betrieb noch wo ich lebe kannte, da ich viel Schwierigkeiten habe an den Gesprächen teilzunehmen (die Leute haben hier einen starken Akzent), spreche ich nicht so viel. Und wenn ich spreche, spreche ich über Arbeit.
Ich möchte nicht nur das technische Vokabular lernen, und mit Leute sprechen, die mir meine Fehler korrigieren, also habe ich mich hier angemeldet, um jemand mit dem zu diskutieren, um meine Sprachkentnisse zu verbessern. Ich kann also Französich zu verbessern beitragen, und nutze Skype jeden Tag. Ich kann auch email tauschen.

___________________________

Hi,
I'm a french student currently working as an intern in a german company since one months and for another two months. Before arriving, I didn't know anyone here in the company as well as in the city. Since the people here have a strong accent, I hardly can participate to the conversations, and the only times I speak German, I speak about work.
Since I intended to improve my German (and not only my knowledge of the technical vocabulary), I decided after being invited by a friend of mine, to register here. I'm also looking for someone to discuss with and help me become more fluent. In exchange, I can help improving your fluency in French. I daily use Skype and can correspond by mail too.

_____________________________

Bonjour,
Je suis un étudiant Français en stage dans une entreprise allemande depuis un mois et pour deux mois encore. Je ne connaissais personne en arrivant, que ce soit dans l'entreprise ou dans la ville ou je loge. J'ai également du mal à me mêler aux conversations à cause de l'accent des gens. Les seuls moments où je parle c'est pour le boulot.
Comme j'ai pas envie de n'apprendre que le vocabulaire technique, une amie m'a convaincu de m'inscrire ici, pour chercher quelqu'un avec qui discuter. Je peux aider à améliorer le niveau de français, j'utilise Skype tous les jours et peux si besoin correspondre par mail également.

_______________________

Furthermore, I'm going to spend one year to study in Canada (Sherbrooke), and I'd like to practise my English before I go there, and maybe, create contacts in Canada or in the USA to travel a little bit. 

I like to talk about music, films, mangas/animes or cooking (but also literature(fantasy, crime fiction, novel or poetry), science or arts in general even if I don't know a lot about it and if I mostly read/have French references).

___________________________

De plus, je vais partir étudier un an au Canada (à Sherbrooke) et j'aimerais améliorer mon anglais avant d'y arriver, voire éventuellement me créer des contacts au Canada anglophone ou aux Etats-Unis pour pouvoir voyager.

Mes centres d'intérêts sont la musique, les films, les mangas ou animes et la cuisine (je peux aussi parler de littérature (fantasy, polar, roman, poésie), de science et d'art en général, mais je ne m'y connais pas beaucoup même si j'aime bien, et n'ai presque que des références françaises)."

My friend had 12-16, *at most* 20 months of experience from internships when he got this job straight out of his undergrad. When someone else asked him about the 6 year experience requirement, he answered - wait for it - ""lol don't worry about it ;)"".

So I'm sitting here feeling very confused. I knew that entry level jobs often say 2-3 years of experience just to throw you off, but 6+ years? Is there any recruiter who can explain to me the reasoning behind this? This is a well established company known for innovation too..."
1feel1,1,2013-05-31,Are you fucking kidding me?,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1feel1/are_you_fucking_kidding_me/,"This whole week got a whole lot worse. Some background on my part, I am a chemical engineering student graduating in under 15 days and for the last 4 months, my life has gone to total shit. If that's not bad, what I am going through right now is a world of mental bullshitting pain that is also eating up my wallet. 

First of all, I got an second interview at a Controls engineering company, Great right? I thought so to. Here I thought, after 4 years of pain, that I was finally gonna have what most people want--- a fucking job. This was for an internship but none the less work experience and getting paid. I had a midterm on Friday, 5/24, and I have my senior design due on 6/7. So after the midterm I was working on design, this is a group project so I was waiting on person#1 to send me his numbers( optimum pressure, temperature, reactor size, separation numbers such as # of trays, basic ChE plant stuff). Let's call person#1 : J. So after doing that for 2 days, it was a 3 day weekend here in the U.S, on the monday before the interview I was preparing for the interview. Before I get too far ahead here, I would like to say that J hasn't given me any numbers yet, and since this is close to the deadline, I am kinda freaking out. But this has happened before and I knew we would figure it out before this was due, so I didn't worry about it too much. Back to the interview, I knew the company wanted someone who wanted some sort of controls software knowledge, so I was studying that online, cause our school doesn't teach us any more than PID controls. So I am online learning about different controllers ( Allan Bradley, Modicon, etc) so I can ace the controls knowledge part of the interview. So I go home on Monday, and again prepare for my interview at home. Come the day of the interview, I get there 10 mins early, and just try to keep myself calm and collected. And at 11AM, one of the interviewees walk in along with the guy who interviewed me for the 1st interview, our school's alumni. I was happy to see him and he told me I needed to impress his team in order to get the internship. No problem, I thought, I have been studying online for a week now about PLC controllers, and I have a solid background knowledge about the company, this is in the bag no sweat. Here's where the trouble begins :
We walk in to the interview and not 10 seconds in, one of the guys tells me, ""we are looking for someone with a solid software background"". I am like ok, all  I know is MATLAB, but I can learn C++, Java, etc. Then the 3 guys start interviewing me and asking me about my projects that I have done in school. I tell them, in detail what I did and they seemed to be impressed. Here I am thinking, ""yea, what I learned in college and in my labs are really helping me out"". But then 15 mins in, they start going into software knowledge, and how good I am in programming, I tell them about what I taught myself in PLC controllers and they ask me if I ever programmed one myself. I tell them no I haven't because I have never seen a PLC in the first place, other than online on YouTube. They were not impressed but still we moved on. Second thing, they start grilling me about different aspects of PLC controllers and I can't say anything other than what I learned online. So after getting crushed at the interview, which was suppose to last 1 hour and it ended up lasting 35 mins, one of the 3 guys shows me around the company and I leave after. I come home feeling super pissed, IF THEY FUCKING WANTED A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING WHY ARE THEY LOOKING FOR CHE's? EVEN MY ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING BUDDIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT PLCs AND NEITHER DOES MY COMPUTER SCIENCE BUDDIES. FUCK ME. Well I take the train back( $90 round trip) and I come back to J messaging me on facebook saying, that he's thinking of withdrawing from the quarter. Remember J hasn't given me any of the numbers previously mentioned. I am about to lose my fucking mind. I go to his house and we go out get some food( I pay for his food as well), cause someone came and stole his wallet. Let me say this before, this guy never locks his front door and anyone can just walk in and take his stuff without anyone knowing. So anyways I tell him before he makes any decisions, talk to our professor cause this is pretty close to turn in time. He emails the professor, and I talk to the professor today and the professor himself is stunned. This has never happened before in the last 15+ years of him teaching this class. And to make it all worse, I get a message from him today at 9:27 PM : ""Dude, I just withdrew myself from the quarter"". FUCK MY LIFE, MAN. SENIOR YEAR OF COLLEGE IS SUPPOSE TO BE FUN. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. IT'S LIKE GOD, IF HE'S REAL, IS UP THERE PLAYING THE GAME, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DESTROY HIS SPIRIT TO LIVE. 

Come on man. I just want a break. Is it too much to ask that after 3.5 years of work, I can't relax cause of stupid bullshit. FML. 

All I'm asking is why can't I get a break man. I want to be able to relax and enjoy the end of senior year with my friends. I just want a freaking job. Is that so hard? Is it? I was already exhausted but after what happened this week I'm just on the verge of saying fuck it all. I don't give a damn anymore. "

Or warn people about major issues that you encountered while working there?

Things that would be interesting to know about:

Did you have trouble with communication?

Were things organized properly?

Do they pay invoices on time?

Do they treat interns fairly?

There are always a thousand little things that I wish I had known before I install a show.  The building is a historical landmark, you can't hang works from the ceiling.  If there's a great bar/bakery/hardware store located in the neighborhood.  If the gallerist is an unreliable alcoholic.  If the employees really went above and beyond to make the show great.  If they are lazy bums who use a text for a press release or their website that a writer wrote for you for a previous catalog/show without accreditation or permission...

I could imagine that anyone from curators, collectors, art handlers, interns, catalog designers, and writers could really benefit from such a website, not just artists.

Am I alone on this?  Are there any other professionals around here that would use a website like this?  I'm wondering if I should try to get this ball rolling..."

I am currently being garnished from an apartment that I signed for my mother 5 years ago. With legal fees, interest, etc. I owe them $7000. I make $14 an hour, full time, and they are able to garnish 20% of my wages which makes it very difficult to pay bills.

I will have a technical degree and have a pretty large chance of finding a job that pays at least $20 an hour by next year.

The next idea I had was taking out a $7k student loan to pay off the garnishment so I could go back to making a livable wage. I would then be at &gt;18k student loan debt total which would be more manageable with the wage I earn next year.

Is this a bad idea? It's really hard to stay motivated with the little money I make now being garnished and I also don't want the garnishment to follow me next year at a new job. Please help. "

Basically I submitted my Resume and Cover letter for peer review - and one of the senior execs of the company I had applied to just so happened to go and comment. He tore it to shreds.

Here's a few things he had to say:

&gt; ""Be careful about editing -- I was able to spot about a half-dozen typographical errors, grammar issues, and punctuation issues in 30 seconds; if I were reviewing you for a detail-oriented role, I'd have passed based on this issue alone""

|

&gt; ""As a student, you can definitely get your resume (and cover letter) to a max of one page. I graduated college in '99 and grad school in '07 and am still using a one-page resume.""

|

&gt; ""Formatting's a bit all over the place -- too many bullet styles, too much indentation and sub-indentation; poor use of white space, poor layout, and lack of parallelism""

That's just half of it. I've honestly never been ripped apart quite so harshly. Not even in art school. I guess what sucks the most is that he didn't have a single positive thing to say."

The program was supposed to last three years of academic study with clinical placements, and a year of 'externship' that worked like a full-time internship. She did well academically, and things seemed to be going well up until the last semester of the third year.

In her final clinical placement before the externship, she was placed with a supervisor who told her in no uncertain terms that she would be graded well if she just shut up and kept out of the way; this was supposed to be hands-on experience, and she was supposed to be graded by how she performed. She vented about this on Facebook (I hasten to add, here, that her venting was neither profanity-laced nor did it mention names) and went the next morning to speak to the person in her department who was in charge, at the time, of clinical placements, as she felt the supervisor was in violation of her field's ethics. The person in charge told her it would be looked into, and everything seemed... not okay, but not end-of-the-world.

The next day after that - so two days, now, after her issue with the clinician - she was called into the department. She went in expecting to discuss her discomfort and try to find some solution to the problem; instead, she was met with hostility and complaints about her own ethics in regards to the Facebook posting. We do not know how they discovered the posting, and we are not even sure right now that they actually did see it; we have and have had only their word, and no evidence of any sort has ever been presented to us.

A week later, she received an official letter of reprimand, though I forget the precise title used. It stated that they were punishing her by forcing her to take another year of academic courses and clinical placements, all of which would have to be paid for, and then might - /might/ - allow her to continue onto what should have been her final year's externship. There was an option to appeal, and she did; first in writing, and then a meeting was set up where she would defend herself face-to-face with the department. 

Again: we had, up to this point - and still have - not seen any of the evidence that was supposedly being used against her. We had the Facebook postings she made, but we have no idea if what they saw was accurate, or... anything, really. This entire ordeal was incredibly stressful, and nervewracking; on the night before the meeting - tribunal seems almost more appropriate - she woke me up at 2am with a box cutter in her hand after trying to cut herself, due to the stress. We decided pretty swiftly, then, to drop it and cut our losses, because her living was far more important than the degree or even the eighty thousand dollars of loans we now owe with nothing to show for it.

I've glossed over a lot, but my question is: a year later, is there any point in speaking to a lawyer about this? We feel that the department treated her poorly by refusing repeated requests for the evidence they held against her, forming a tribunal-of-sorts that included only members of the department that was accusing her of ethics violations (no impartial members), and making the original reprimand far more serious than the issue at hand seemed to possibly warrant.

Thank you."
1fdwtf,7,2013-05-31,Advice on completely an internship while having social anxiety.,throwthatawaymkay,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1fdwtf/advice_on_completely_an_internship_while_having/,"Hi! I’m a longtime lurker, first time poster. I'm very anxious in social situations. Specifically, I tend to dwell on past social situations for a long time and think about how stupid/wrong/dumb I was in a previous encounter and how I should never be social again. Then I start avoiding social situations, which is problematic now that I'm in a situation that demands constant social interaction.

 The thing you’re about to read are merely current symptoms of my worrying problem. It’s a lot of shit to describe my patterns of worry and how they apply to my current situation. So skip down if you want.  

I’m going to a shiny new Washington DC internship with an organization that I like a lot. And I’m scared shitless. The reasons are 1) I’m anxious 2) I rented a room in a house sight-unseen (they gave me pictures, but I didn’t visit) and am very anxious to meet the people I’m sharing the house with 3) I feel fucking incompetent half the time. I’ll go into detail about each on.

1) A little anxious. I do get anxious in social situations. Talking to people? Fuck that shit, it’s terrifying.  My heart races, I get sweaty palms, I usually blank out. I don’t know what the fuck to talk about unless I have a “mission” to tell someone something specific (eg – “did you know Governor Deal refused to endorse the Medicaid expansion? Here, take this pamphlet!”). Despite these problems, I can usually acknowledge in the moment that there’s no reason to freak out. They’re just people. But my body doesn’t seem to listen.  And on rare occasions I freak out completely. I'm currently in freak out mode with regards to my internship.

I recieved a mass email that was given to all the other interns discussing dress code, basic rules, blahblahblah. I’m coming out of town, and I though the other interns were too, so I sent a group email to the interns on the mass email thing asking if anyone had tips on finding affordable housing. Sure enough, several interns responded with similar concerns, which I was totally relieved about. 

So a few weeks pass, and I’m about to fly to DC. I send another group email suggesting that we meet up before the start date to make things less awkward on our first day as interns. Again, I’m thinking that out-of-towners won’t know anyone and might want to find one person to hang with. Doesn’t sound like I’m anxious at all, right? WRONG. I did this to push myself out of my comfort zone. I knew that I would freak out the first day and wouldn’t be able to function unless I knew someone a little bit. I knew that meeting up awkwardly for coffee would be a little better than meeting up while under the pressure of performing well on our first day. Even writing the email was bad, though. I got frustrated and mad that I didn’t know what to say in the email. I spent 2 hours on a 3 line email. But afterwards I got a little excited because the interns seemed really receptive to the housing email, and some even suggested rooming together. I thought people would really dig my carefully crafted email.

 Oh, how quickly my excitement melted into fear and doubt. I prefaced both emails by saying something to the effect of “let me know if you don’t want to get these mass emails. I know it’s weird to email people that you don’t know.” No one told me to remove them the first time around, but I still wrote it down. So sure enough, a person gives me a short “please remove me from this mass email”. She used the same words as I did - “mass email” – which bugged me and made me feel like she was mocking me. I’m sure the reader is thinking “what did the OP expect? Of course some people will be uncomfortable with mass emailing.” Yeah, some people will be uncomfortable. But why didn’t they express this in the first email? Is it me suggesting to go somewhere? Am I going to be considered “that girl” in the office that tries reallyreally hard to get to know people? Am I annoying this person? The only reason I’m doing it is because I know if I don’t try reallyreally hard, I will completely shut down to other people. So now I’m terrified that this person hates me for sending an email that they find repellent, trying too hard, and unnecessary. Like a mass email. Will/Do other interns feel similarly ( I just sent the email out today)? Should I have never sent out an email in the first place? Will this email ruin their first impressions of me? I literally can’t think of anything else.  I want to hide under a rock. When the other interns see me, they’ll think “there’s that mass email girl. Ugh.” I don't know how to control my thoughts at the moment.

2) Sight unseen. I know, reader. You’re thinking that it was dumb as fuck to rent a room sight unseen, right? Since I can’t spend 2000 bucks on a plane ticket to see my room, I really had no choice. So I did all the research I could on the person I was renting from (a family, actually), I looked up the coordinates of the house, and I asked trip advisor peeps about the neighborhood. It all checks out well. 

EXCEPT I’m so fucking terrified of meeting these people, making small talk with them every day when I go to the kitchen, and asking them for the wifi password. They’re picking me up from the airport upon my arrival, and I have no idea of what to say when I see them. I’m even more worried because their first generation immigrants, and it’s very difficult to understand them (on the phone at least). What if I can’t understand them? What if I offend them? I’m starting to think stuff like “well…I don’t have to use the kitchen…I can just live off of trail mix and water from the bathroom sink for 3 months!” I know that will be rough. How do I talk to people that I know nothing about, have nothing in common with, and might/might not understand? How do I relax?

3) Incompetence. This internship is with a nonprofit that I like a lot. It’s the kind of place where you’re always learning about what you don’t know. I feel like I’ll be less informed/less social/a total dumbass compared to the other people there. I sort of did that at my last internship. How do I not worry about that?

 

**tl;dr: I sent out a mass email that someone got annoyed with and I feel terrible about it. I’m moving into a house with people I don’t know and I don’t know how to talk to them. I feel fucking stupid. How do I stop getting anxious about these things?**

I'd prefer advice that doesn't involve medication or therapy - I cannot afford it. 


PS: Title should read ""completing an internship."" I feel so fucking stupid. "

Anyway, I currently have a 3.81 gap(I'm trying my damn hardest to hit the 3.9 mark just to get summa cum laude recognition). I'm majoring in history with a minor in Russian. I should also note that I have not taken or practiced for either the LSAT or GRE. However, I've read up on their format and know their style of questions. I've also been a pretty strong standardized test taker. That's not to say that I'll get the highest score, but rather that I'm very good at taking tests and thinking under pressure.
I've had this internal struggle between law and graduate school after college. The more I think about it the more I feel as if I'm stuck at a fork in the road. I do have a deep interest in law, specifically criminal law. I've taken some pre-law(crim pro, con. law) courses at my school and my professors have told me that my thought process is perfect for law since I have great memory and can think on my feet. I also really enjoy studying history. I can easily see myself working as a historian.  In fact, the graduate student run journal is publishing a paper of mine.  I know that's not much since it's bottom considered a bottom of the barrel kind of accomplishment, but it gives me this impression that my hard work is not just imaginary.

Now, one of the main reasons I can't decide is because careers have a fairly poor employment outlook. I cannot see myself doing anything really that isn't academically related or isn't related to law. (Note: I've interned at law firms and assisted with legal research and writing. Currently, I'm a university-sponsered internship where I work with a museum curator researching Soviet history and artwork. So I've had some exposure to both of my dream fields. How should I go about this, Reddit? After speaking to several friends and professors, I've learned that in graduate school I have a much better chance of getting a PhD debt free(or close to it), while in law school I'm pretty much guaranteed at least $150K+ debt unless I qualify for an immense scholarship.

Also, I'm fairly new to Reddit and I'm reposting this from an ASKREDDIT topic I opened.  I got very few results there, and I was thinking that people in this subreddit would have a better idea of my dilemma and could probably provide more personal advice."

I know I should save for retirement once I have a real job but I'm not sure if it my summer internship is the time to do it. It's better for me to have cash for down-payments on house or whatever. Also, I have no bills while I'm at school during the year; my parents pay for everything. Therefore, I have no loans too.  

I was told briefly about the company's 401k program at orientation, and It doesn't appear that theres any matching amount included (maybe I'm missing it?). I'm mostly confused on how this (401k) works, in order to make a logical decision. Which I'm pretty sure the best idea is to just keep all my money for now. **Is there any significant reason for me to save some for retirement now as opposed to keeping it accessible?**

Frankly, I've come to realize quite quickly that I know little about how a lawyer works day to day, never mind how one works who practices patent law. The most stunning thing I've found out so far, which seems obvious in retrospect, is how important divisional patents are to corporate product lines. One thing I do know that these next few weeks may be the last time I have the opportunity to work in an office that does patent law for at least a year, and probably many more years before I ever set foot inside a company.

Tried to kick my ass into gear, and I did. I got a good internship. I made good connections. I started being more cleanly, and I focused on things that I wanted to do for my future.

And yet, looking back, I feel no pride. I have no sense of accomplishment. I can only keep thinking ""meh, i could've done better."" or ""it wasn't enough. people have done much more than that"".  I have no sense of accomplishment in the effort I've put in.

I don't believe it was that difficult.  I had to change a lot of my mindset, and my old mindset (which is not entirely gone) was a lazy piece of garbage.  I'm really not anything special, and I don't feel as if I have the right to feel proud or accomplished for what I've done, because so many others have done so much more, and I'm still a lazy, spoiled piece of work.  I don't want to be, and I'm trying to change that.

But I want to feel proud of my work.  I want to be able to look at my work and not think ""it's really nothing special"", even when people who know what they are talking about tell me it is something special, or it was done very well.  

The only thing in the past year or so I have felt proud of was simple. This past weekend my father and I laid down some heavy slab into a drench so that leaves were easier to clean up. I had nothing to do that day. We ordered pizza, hung out, talked, and generally had a damn good time. And I looked at that drench and thought ""wow, i was a part of that.  It looks nice, and I was able to put form and function into that ditch through the use of my body.""

For everything else?  Bah.  It's a bunch of words I don't have work hard to write because I put that effort in a long time ago.  And I really don't know how to fix it, because I know it's going to kill my discipline at some point. I'll eventually get to the point where I do not care because I have no joy in caring.  It's just work.

Any ideas? Has anyone else been there?  I apologize if this sounds like whining (please tell me if it does), but I want to feel proud about my actions."

Both studying at a well-known university in difficult majors. Together for ~1.5 years, met freshman year and passionately fell in love with each other. The break-up occurred about a year ago this upcoming July. It was unexpected from my side, but apparently he had been thinking about it for a couple months. He was on internship and I was completing summer courses, leaving no time to visit each other three states away. We are both very focused and hard-working people; a great influence for the break-up (initiated by him) was due to our studies and career planning. It was a horrible break-up, no one ""won"" and both of us were emotional wrecks for weeks. 

Stupid me refused to accept that I needed time away from him and we continued a pseudo-relationship for 5 months after the break-up - he would come over for dinner, a PG-rated massage (no forms of affection, no sex), and conversation with the usual goodbye hug at the end of the night. This would occur once a week. At the same time, I began searching for other guys to date, hoping this would help me get over him. I got into another relationship, and when my former bf visited me for dinner and a massage, I told him I could not give him the massage. I felt that was borderline cheating on my new bf. Although he was aware that I was seeing this new guy, he became very upset, and accused me of betraying his trust. We fought over text for 2 hours on the same day my new (and current) bf asked me to be his gf, which has tainted my current relationship every since. My former bf refuses to talk to me or acknowledge my existence, which upsets me greatly. I know this is a HUGE indication that I should not be in a relationship right now, but I feel like I haven't given my current bf a chance - since he is constantly compared to my former bf. 

I cry myself to sleep every other day because I feel like I ruined everything, including a second chance with my former bf. I have tried therapy and counseling to ease the pain, but nothing is working. I don't want to move on from him. I love him, even though I was hurt when he decided to break up with me. I would go back to him in a heartbeat, our personalities clicked and we treated each other well. I just wish he would mature and figure out how to communicate his feelings better, what he couldn't communicate to me when he broke up with me. I am in a constant state of confusion with how he responded to my new relationship; he broke up with me, he shouldn't care that I'm with someone else. 

Can anyone explain the male mentality in this situation? I feel like I unintentionally hurt my true love because I didn't accept that we needed time apart. How can I mend this? How can I stop my constant heartbreak? How can we get on speaking terms again?

After working my first internship a bit, I'm here to say...it doesn't get much better! Stop talking about how bad you wanna graduate (unless your a 5th year...), because the real world is just as freaking boring, just in other ways. Pretty much all of the engineers at the massive company I'm working for have a hard time holding a conversation, even the other interns. Just like working at Tech to get involved and meet people, it gets 10x harder when you start a job. Don't get caught in the grass is greener type mentality. College can be the best time of your life. Get out. Have fun.

Here at Tech, I first fit into another one of those in the first category I described: I felt that this place ruined me after my freshman year. I was absolutely unhappy with life because I didn't really do anything, developed some anxiety issues, and blamed this school for EVERYTHING. In my future years, I've taken the more laid back approach, calmed down a ton, met more people, taken up 100 different hobbies. I stopped blaming this place for making me a certain way, and learned that if one day is complete shit, tomorrow can only be better. If you can't figure out that thermo problem and it's 3 am, go the fuck to sleep. Tackle it tomorrow with some help from someone else in the class. I generally love life now, even at Tech. It's a little bit of work to get to know others, but it's so worth it. Tech really does contain some of the best people. We're all incredibly similar anyways right?

A lot of my friends/family have said I've come leaps and bounds in such a short time. My advice is to do what everyone is posting about now! Get involved. Meet some other people. You'll find some gems in this school. Stop blaming this place for certain issues. Is it Tech's fault that I took life way too seriously and studied myself into depression? Yes, you have to work when you get here, but working hard doesn't have to make you unhappy.

Please let me know your opinions here. I haven't really shared much of my story, but I guess some advice to any incoming freshmen or students that are having a rough time. Let me know what you think.

Surgeons, technicians, and other redditors, is there a way to train yourself or is this pretty much a have-it-or-you-don't innate skill."
1fdiwf,43,2013-05-30,What do you do with interns?,Inigo93,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1fdiwf/what_do_you_do_with_interns/,"So we constantly see students around here talking about internships at various companies.  My own organization hires a limited number of them... or so I hear.  I've never dealt with one.  I don't know what I would do with one.  Full blown engineering grads are difficult enough to work with, I can't imagine finding meaningful tasking for somebody who's only going to be around for a couple of months.  By the time they've figured out which is their ass and which is the hole in the ground, they're gone.  

So to those who hire and make use of interns... What do you actually have them do?

edit:  One thing I should probably point out is that the Powers That Be have specifically prohibited my group from having interns.

1fdif9,2,2013-05-30,Moving to Austin for the summer. Need help!,dirtbkb,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1fdif9/moving_to_austin_for_the_summer_need_help/,"I am a 20 year old male finishing my second year at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo studying Business. I just recently received an offer for an internship in Austin and am now looking for a place to stay. 

My internship runs from June 19th till beginning of September. This seems to be a little difficult with subleasing but that's ok. I plan on just figuring it out once end of July comes around on where to live after that. 

From what I can tell, most students live in West campus and it is relatively close to work by bus. So essentially, I am asking if anyone would like to sublet me for the rest of the summer at a reasonable rate. Roommate would be preferred. 

Thanks for reading!"
1fdi1i,1,2013-05-30,"What is a ""Co-op"" at your school?",Apriletters,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1fdi1i/what_is_a_coop_at_your_school/,"At my school, you go back to the same company every other semester three or five times. But when I see people talking about co-ops here, it seems no different than an internship? People talk of having ""one co-op, 2 internships"" sometimes, but with my school, that would be nearly impossible.

Help me understand?"
