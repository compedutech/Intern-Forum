I have an upcoming phone interview for a position as an administrative assistant. What can I do to be fully prepared for this? How can I refresh myself with knowledge of Microsoft Excel, Word, etc.? I was laid off my last job working as a product tester for a computer company so I have general knowledge of computer software/hardware. 

Within the past two months I've applied to 30-40 jobs online and followed up with a phone call to all of them to find they aren't hiring. (I don't know why they list the job as open) So what are your tips on how to be prepared for the interview and the responsibilities of the position in general? If i don't end up getting this job, where are some good places to apply or what are some things i can do? I've had my resume reviewed by my school's career placement services. Are there any good jobs that I can intern at that would be worthwhile?
No money to go out so I really need some advice because I am sick and tired of being home 24/7."

I am in the last 6 months of college here in Pittsburgh PA. I am currently an IT student with a concentration in Network security and computer forensics. So, I'm in the beginning process of attempting to land a nice internship in IT security or computer forensics of some sort. 


My school is not too supportive in finding internships outside of the companies they seem to be partnered with. From what I have noticed, they see us students as a number.. so a help-desk job is what they will give me. (nothing against help-desk, but I already am help-desk and didn't attend college to keep my same job).


Anyway, is anyone familiar with a company/organization dealing anything I'm looking for? Hopefully near the Pittsburgh area :D 
I know its a long shot, but anything helps!


Thanks!"

Recently, in an attempt to get an internship with a local tech company, I approached a parent who is an employee there at my high school (that I've since graduated from) and struck up a friendship with him. He's roughly 40, and is married with a child, obviously, in high school.

The internship has taken a while in panning out (I am going to be out of the country until April, and wanted it for April - May), but we continued talking over gchat, text, and twitter dm. I've seen him in person a grand total of four times since then - twice at his house for dinner with his family and other people from the company, once at a company-sponsored movie event, again with his family, and once at a coffeeshop where I had another girlfriend present. Our friendship has really blossomed online though, and we're pretty close - I generally see myself / am seen as mature for my age.

One of my BIGGEST concerns has always been keeping all of our interactions innocuous and platonic. He gives a LOT of compliments, and thinks I'm funny, but I've always discouraged him about saying things like that because it legitimately makes me uncomfortable. Aside from those instances, though, I feel like we do have a lot in common.

My judgement about people is generally pretty good, and I know that he loves his wife and kid very much. I don't think our friendship is another other than two people platonically enjoying each other's company, and primarily online. We exchanged CD's of the music that we'd been talking about, and gifts for Christmas - I bought something specifically for his FAMILY.

My parents recently found the CD he made me in my car. They knew about our friendship and the places I'd gone, etc, but haven't actually met him. Understandably, they were more than a little concerned, but I don't know how to communicate to them that our friendship is PURELY platonic. They don't believe me when I tell them this, and I'm not sure what to do. At their request, I've told my friend that I can't talk to him anymore, but I also don't want to completely ditch a friendship that I've spent months building and enjoying. What should I do? And am I just crazy to assume that our friendship really is legitimate / platonic?

**tl;dr** Platonically friends with an older guy, parents are suspicious, need to show them that it's fine."

In fact, I liked the city so much that I'm curious to know if its possible for me to move to austin and I got a few questions for you


* How's the job situation around here? I'm studying EE and will be finish by next fall, so is it possible for me to even find a job around here? I had heard that bunch tech companies had moved to TX due to cheap land and taxes, but are they still around. I know as a fact you guys have some good companies, such as facebook, but anything more toward EE and not oil related?

* If not a job, how about internships? Possible for an out of state student to get something or most jobs go to UT austin students?

* Whats the average rent around the city. We went by this one street that was away from the downtown area and had bunch of hippie shops and a lot of food trucks. It was pretty similar to the mission in SF. We saw bunch of apts and was curious to know how much rent would be in that area or maybe even in downtown?

* Whats Austins political scene? From my experience, it seemed to be the most liberal city in Texas, even though I got in a few argument with one guy who was defending the conservatives agenda.

* How do the local react to foreigners, aka non white/black/Latino? I'm middle eastern, and as much as I look white and can blend in pretty easily, I rather not since I'm pretty proud of my background. I'm not arrogant, but I would ideally want to be in a community thats open minded to other ethnicities.

The reason I enjoyed the city was because it really reminded of bay area, due to its shops and food, but it is the cleaner/ version of it. Also the craziness of 6th st was definitely fun. Anyhow, any input would be helpful"

Hopefully someone has some advice or a lost soul.,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/euxbi/i_hate_my_life_and_where_i_am_hopefully_someone/,"My story.  I'm sure few will care, but hopefully there's someone out there with advice for me.

Over the past year or two I feel like I have gotten stuck in a rut in my life.  Every day feels like it's just going to be one big disappointment.  Ever since I went away to college, I feel like I've changed for the worst.  Two of my grandparents have passed away along with a close friend of mine who I used to work with.  I'm afraid to get close to anyone and let them know how I feel, I barely even talk to my parents about my personal life beyond on what they see from the outside.  I don't remember what it feels like to not be an insomniac, staring at the walls at night wishing everything was different.  I feel cold, unemotional, anxious.  I feel like everyone is trying to ridicule me and I'm quick to retaliate even when it is completely unwarranted.  I feel like I'm always letting everyone down, especially my parents.  The academic program I was in required the students to complete several semesters of internships with engineering firms, however I was one of the few students in the entire program to not get a job.  I have decent grades and pretty good people skills, but now I'm associated with all the fuck-ups who are failing out.  My family was counting on me to get a job to help pay for school, now we're tight on money.  The only time I feel happy is when I get high and I hate myself for this.  My dad was recently diagnosed with cancer and is back in the hospital.  I'm really scared what the future holds.  I need help but am too afraid to admit anything is wrong.  I hate my life and have been questioning if it's worth living anymore.  Hopefully someone has some advice on where to go or what to do, or even an anonymous face to listen to me rant about my troubles."

How can I cope?",Sickofsocialstigmata,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/euw1a/i_am_21_about_to_kickstart_a_very_successful/,"First off this is a throw away account as I don't want this to be traced.

To put it bluntly I am a 21yo virgin who knew what they wanted to do when they were 16 and dedicated their life to finishing high school with the marks to get into it and I did not fit in with the regular crowd, whilst my colleagues were out under-age drinking and chatting up girls I was playing my Gamecube and watching Red VS Blue. When high school finished I made more friends with the academic staff than I did students and as a result I get work at my old school paying very well cash in hand and great people to talk to. My colleagues are either exactly the same with the exact same group of friends out of high school or changing their degree for the second time, not ALL of them, but you get the idea. When I got to college I felt right at home, but still didn't get along with 95% of the people in the course as they wanted to go out drinking pick up chicks or whatever, this just never appealed to me. I preferred - and still prefer - having a 2L bottle of Coke and playing World of Warcraft whilst watching Battlestar Galactica. I get along with everyone at college in my course, as I am a humble person, if you knew me and read this you would be surprised i'd be saying all this. Once again I am good friends the teaching staff as I learn a lot from them out of lectures, but I only have two good friends out of 180 people.

Fast forward a year I got an internship with a tier 1 company and got a bucket tonne of experience with them and when I finished with them I took a massive leap career wise getting another internship at another company, something only a few lucky people get the chance to do. A lot of my college colleagues are jealous and some people I know are suddenly like ""Woah holy shit, you're going to start a career I could only ever dream of"" they're happy for me, but naturally a bit jealous. People from high school are suddenly, shit, I would never expect that from you. When I finish my final year I will graduate and can potentially earn $100k, including extras.

I am happy with myself, I love my hobbies, I am a smart guy who loves what he does and I feel that is what has gotten me where I am, I am a hardcore geek and eccentric. In addition to all that I hate drinking and only do it willingly twice a year, the other times is just to 'fit in'. 
Recently I was out having drinks with some work colleagues and they said I needed to pick up, get out root women, they were giving me tips on what to look out for and then 'go in for the kill', I appreciate their advice and I know they're doing it to give me a good time. However, it just doesn't interest me that much, sex isn't a 'Omfg I want to tap that' thing for me. I hate clubs and loud venues and I just can't comprehend the thought of sleeping with someone I met 5 seconds ago, I will admit I find some girls hot or beautiful, but it's just not me to go out and sleep with them on a whim, I need to get to know them. It’s something that normally doesn’t bother me that much, but when I am surrounded by people who talk about it all the time, which is fair enough, but they bring me into it and I don’t feel comfortable as I lack experience in that area as well as interest and it’s getting hard as I get older and still have no philanthropic stories to tell and even my parents make comments about me not having a girlfriend. It’s just hit me recently and I am asking myself, do I really want a one night stand a fling or a relationship? It seems everyone has to fit the stereotype of having a job and a family. I certainly wouldn’t mind someone to wake up to everyday and I won’t deny that I don’t ask the occasional person out (With a majority ending with, I have a boyfriend), my job is my priority at the moment and I have no need or desire for a relationship, but I feel I ‘need’ to have one and as time goes on I feel I am making things worse by having no sexual experience and dread what would happen if I said to a woman as a 29 or 40 year old saying, i’ve never had sex. I just feel that I am just gonna get absolutely wasted one time and go out on a night in the town and just try and get it over with so I can move on. What do you think of all this, am I missing something, is there a variable I have overlooked, am I only caring because others bring it up and can’t understand my view on it all?

**tl;dr I am a 21yo who has never had a relationship about to start a career with a starting salary of $100k and I am worried not having a relationship or sex with people will cause problems later on in life when people ‘expect’ you to have the basics.**

P.S Sorry about the grammar, I am just blurting this out without thinking how to structure it. I hope you get what I am asking."
euvfm,7,2011-01-02,losing passion in everything i do,tiredatwork,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/euvfm/losing_passion_in_everything_i_do/,"Dear Reddit,
I feel myself slipping away. 

I graduated with a degree in Aerospace Engineering.  When I was a sophomore in college, I almost changed my degree to English (my passion at the time was literature) but changed my mind after talking to and being influenced by many people, including my mother. She was adamant that I stick to a more practical major, and while I did make an effort to go talk to an English advisor about changing my degree, I eventually settled back into Aerospace Engineering.  Coming from a Filipino upbringing, it is not uncommon to steer your children in the direction of math and engineering.  Please keep in mind, the decision I made to settle back into engineering took a great deal of thought (I wasn’t mindlessly “giving in” to my mother, as some of my peers claimed).  

Despite my lack of passion in the field, I managed to graduate as a Magna Cum Laude, studied abroad twice, and had two internships.   I was determined to make my undergrad experience as enriching as possible.

My confusion with my family and my upbringing led me discover another discipline that I came to really appreciate:  Sociology.  When I was in my 4th year (I did a self-initiated 5-year program on account of study abroad/internships), I picked up a minor in the subject.  After studying different facets of Sociology (including some classes I took while abroad in Southeast Asia), I quickly became interested in the field of International Development.  I’ve since been making very slow strides to directing my career into this direction.   When I was in undergrad, I joined the organization Engineers Without Borders and served as the “General Curriculum Chair.” I learned that it’s very easy to get caught up in this need to “introduce technology for the benefit of mankind” with total disregard for the complexity of social and cultural dynamics.  I tried my best to encourage interdisciplinary approaches to our work. 

Where am I now?  Since last May, I’ve been working as a design engineer at a large engineering company, one that everybody on Reddit is probably familiar with.   I work 7-4, walk through the actions, and find myself taking on more and more responsibility.  Reddit, I feel my mind slowly deteriorating. I live each day, stressed from deadlines and stressed from the engineers around me. There are days, seriously, where I go to the bathroom for the sole purpose of crying.  Then when I go home, I try to find a way to bury my thoughts, because I can hardly focus.  I listen to “inspiring music” and find myself feeling even more miserable for not making a change in my life.  I feel inadequate in knowledge and skill, and the thought of applying to grad school depresses me.  My ability to write effectively has gone down the shitter, and I hardly know how to express myself anymore.  

Realistically speaking, I should be incredibly grateful to be where I am now.  I have a solid job and a new car.  I live in a brand new city, and I’ve always loved to live in new places…. But…. interestingly, I’ve never been more depressed than I have been in the past 8 months.  It’s becoming almost a habit for me to sit still and start crying.  I’ve been thinking of seeing a counselor, because this “low cycle” is lasting far longer that I expected.  In the past, I’ve typically been able to deal with situational depression by consulting my friends, by writing, and then ultimately making a change. Now, I find that I lack the motivation that it takes to go places. 

I’ve been back home (family home) for the holidays, but will be returning back to my new home (work home) tomorrow.  I am going nuts right now because I’ve been crying a lot and I don’t really know how to deal with this.  I feel like I should go see a counselor, but if I was prescribed meds, I don’t know if I’d want to take them.  Like I said, I’ve always found a way out…

Just know I’m trying to make effort to get in the right direction.  The other day, in an attempt to start my New Year’s Resolutions, I called a University near my new home, and I may be able to talk to an advisor of the International Studies program.  I’m hoping they may give me some direction/guidance.  Also, I plan on eating a lot better and exercising a lot more.  Hopefully this can help me get back on track.

euu8c,4,2011-01-02,Anyone on Reddit here have opinions about unpaid internships in the Film Industry?,LAorBust,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/euu8c/anyone_on_reddit_here_have_opinions_about_unpaid/,"Here is the thing, unpaid internships are illegal, but the film industry seems to be a place where rules don't apply since it is so competitive, that if you don't take the unpaid job, someone else will.

I have a chance to go for an interview and start gaining experience in the field that I want to go into (film distribution/acquisitions). However, there is an opportunity is in LA which might help me to get some direct experience. 

cons:
- I don't live in LA right now. (but i do have family in LA to crash with)
- Is unpaid
- The company is small, so the potential to hire afterwards is probably non-existent. So after this is done I go back to the job hunt.
- I just graduated, but the job is meant for someone still in school (since it is part time). 
- Leave comfort of home, ease of access to the huge number of corporate job opportunities in Northern CA. 


Pros
- This specific type of internship doesn't come up too often.
- I am unemployed and still applying to places, but other than that I am sitting home doing nothing. So this might be 3 months of something to do. 


So, does anyone have similar experience in this industry, and have any suggestions or advice about taking such a position and if you think it will be worth it? 

any advise or suggestions would help. thanks reddit!

",withmymagazines,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/evgy3/hey_reddit_im_feeling_very_unfulfilled/,"So here's what's up. I'm a 22, almost 23, y/o graduate student. I finished undergrad on time on the deans list. I've been fortunate to have successful jobs. I have my own apartment and car. I'm healthy, I'm not a neckbeard, I'm 6' and pushing 140lbs. I live with my beautiful girlfriend, whose only downside is occasionally being prone to being a crazy girl. This is a new reddit account in hopes that a blank slate will help me.


Lately, my life feels overwhelmingly unfulfilled. 


I get little to nothing out of my college experiences at present as my university has a bad program for my major (Geography) I'd love to pick up and move to California but I have a lease until October. My job is a student internship, so I can't drop out.

I commute 50mi each way to work/school. At work if there's something given to me, I do it, but it involves my teaching myself/figuring out how to do something entirely on my own. My first day of work I was handed a copy of M$ Access 2007 for dummies. I don't really do a lot. I'm on reddit now. 
**Disclaimer** I understand how fortunate I am to actually have a job, and a good paying one. I'm just explaining that my job doesn't really help to my lack of feeling fulfilled.

When I get home it's about 5:30 and I have about 30 minutes of alone time to involve shamelessly in ""me"" activities ... smoke a small bowl, check /r/gonewild, etc. But by the time I get my shoes off, change, go to the bathroom, that's pretty much over. There's usually a significant amount of dishes and cleaning up to do so I don't feel the yelling voice of insanity coming from the OCD part of my brain, so I try to take care of that while I still have the energy.. lately I just haven't had it.

We're still working on a few ""real people"" things like having a dinner scheme. We definitely need to have a better plan for eating and grocery shopping.. maybe a set day of the week, but we haven't implemented anything like that yet. 

By the time getting home, settling down, and eating is over with it's probably at least 7:30, and I've got 3 hours before I need to start getting ready for bed and hitting the sack by 12. We wake up at 6:50ish. We're so tired that a lot of cleaning up gets pushed to the weekend and a lot of tv marathons of shit like CSI occur (absolutely hate it). I get in some nazi zombies or black ops because hey, I'm a guy, and ""nerd"" has always fallen in my self description. Getting to play something I enjoy and having fun DOES make me feel fulfilled but if you've ever tried been on xbox live you're aware that sometimes you can spend an hour and get NOTHING DONE. I got some workout equipment for Xmas, pull up bar, etc., and I've put everything together but I haven't used it yet. I just haven't had the energy. Maybe I should take vitamins, but honestly, and I know it sounds ridiculous, sometimes it's too much of a hassle (or I don't have the energy) to do little things like brush my teeth, wash my face, etc before I pick myself off the couch and fall onto the bed for the night. Sometimes I'm all over these things like a machine but that hasn't been the case lately. Occasionally I just fall into these slumps. Maybe it's the winter.

*I'm not even in the mood for sex lately.*

I want to do things like try some new restaurants in town, go out for a drink and explore the area we live in more, but this is a seemingly massive task for my current routine. Every other weekend or so I drive the half hour to where I went to undergrad and go out with my friends who are still there, but I'm one of those people who HATES sleeping somewhere but home and end up being a buzzkill, stop drinking at a certain point, wait a few hours, and drive home.

I need some new things to do. Yeah, I've got board games, and they're okay every now and then. I was thinking about picking up running again, something both me and my girlfriend used to be very big on, but I've developed asthma (I don't get attacks, but I have weak lungs) and I'm not sure how I'll fare in the cold upstate NY weather running outside. I can't handle the humidity in the summer so I ran at the indoor track at my old school. I'm also daunted by the price of under armor cold gear. I've been bugging the woman to get a cat because I thought having a pet would better our lifestyle but she has her worries and it's a potentially 10-20 year commitment,etc.

I need some motivation.. or something, as well. Yesterday I got up at 11 (I hate when I sleep in, but it happens every Sat/Sun), thought about washing the car, but all I really did was start re-watching LOST and play some black ops. And is much as I wanted to do MORE - I didn't know what, and I was mostly overwhelmed with being annoyed I wasn't doing more and another weekend was over.

But I gotta do something, Reddit. I'm fucking 22 years old. I need to be living more than this. Hell, I didn't even turn on the radio on my 50 minute commute today. 

So Reddit... what should I do to get things going right and feel happily fulfilled?

I want to get into programming for a living, but I'm not sure where to start. I've been coding C\C++ for more than two years now, but only as a hobby, mostly in gaming related areas. I'm tired of working at my soul sucking job flipping burgers and I'm ready to do something with my life.

A few of my projects:

**The Anniversary Edition Installer, a mod installer for the game Oni.**
This was coded in C++, using wxWidgets for the UI and boost for filesystem access. I would have used normal Windows APIs, but the code needed to be compilable for Macs, too. How it actually installs modifications isn't a topic I want to get into in this post, but I can on request. 

[Screenshot](http://gumby.oni2.net/AE/aeinstallerscreenshot.jpg)

**The Daodan DLL**

An engine patching DLL for Oni, it is replaces an unneccessary DLL the engine uses and instead patches and hooks the engine for whatever purpose desired. Coded in C, with a bit of assembly for hooks and patches. I'm not the original creator of it, but I am the sole caretaker at the moment. I know the code inside of it pretty well and I've added on several features beyond the original purpose of the DLL, which was to stop a crash caused by OpenGL extensions strings overflowing a fixed buffer.

**Flatline - Oni Multiplayer**

A very educational experiment in networking for me. Using the Daodan DLL as a base, I have started work on Multiplayer for Oni.

[WIP Video 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-L8g6UocCo)

Unfortunately the project is on hold at the moment while in talks with a certain company to get actual access to Oni's source. Currently any work done on Oni's engine (multiplayer or otherwise) is done by decompiling and analyzing the engine. Sounds fun, Doesn't it?

**Star Wars: Moviebattles II**

SW: MBII is a total conversion modification for Star Wars: Jedi Academy, which is based on the Q3 engine, written in C. A full description of the game can be found at http://www.moviebattles.com/about

I'm part of the development team. Fun stuff, currently getting prepared for a new content patch within a month. There aren't really any good videos or screenshots of my work on it around. My work there involves a lot of 3D math and such.

Do you think I have what it takes to get a job? (or a paid internship at the very least...) I live in Seattle, so I know there are software companies around, I just don't know where I should look to find a job. If you don't think I'm ""ready"" to join the professional world, what should I focus my studies on (other than less games, that one is kind of obvious)?"
ev94p,1,2011-01-02,I need a sounding board:  Am I being a selfish asshole?,EquinsuOcha,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ev94p/i_need_a_sounding_board_am_i_being_a_selfish/,"Sit tight, this one is going to be a long story.  I'll try my best to keep it brief and not overwhelm you with the details, but I try and do some sort of self reflection from time to time (without the Stuart Smalley mirror), and really gauge if my behavior is out of line.  Strangely, I have a very supportive group of close friends, so I'd actually like to run all this by strangers, and get their opinions.


Backstory:  I met my current girlfriend, 15 years ago when I was in the Marines.  It was absolutely love at first sight, and we were together for two years.  Unfortunately, we broke up, due to a lot of immaturity on our parts, and the outside influence of people who did not approve of me, or my occupation (what kind of life are you expecting with him, he's probably cheating on you, etc.).  I got out of the Marines two years later, unable to recapture that kind of magic with another woman, and kinda bounced around from one shallow relationship to another.  Shortly thereafter, a friend recommended me to her niece, and we actually hit it off.  It wasn't overwhelming puppy love, but she was in to me, and I was in to her.  We dated long distance for three months, and I admittedly overlooked a lot of our incompatibilities because I was eager to get over my long lost love, and because all my friends I grew up with had paired off with wives and started families, and I subconsciously thought I should too.  We were engaged without even living together, and married a year later.  I relocated out of state to be with her, and supported both of us in a tiny rented room while she finished out the last year of school.  Things were good.  Sorta.


I got more promotions at work, she took unpaid internships to bolster her resume.  I made more money and used the GI Bill to buy a house, she quit her job to start her own consulting business, and worked from home.  The dot-com bubble burst right after 9/11, and I was laid off the same week she found out she was pregnant.


I'll spare you the details of the downfall of our relationship, but while money cannot buy you happiness, being poor affords you all kinds of misery.  I could not find work, and we ended up relocating to my hometown to live with my father.  The marriage did not last, and on my daughter's first birthday, my wife moved out with my little girl.  A few weeks later, she was dating someone else.  The marriage was over.


It took two years of fighting, angry hanging up the phone, and all kinds of name calling on her part, where I tried to take the high road, but admittedly failed many times, but in the end, we ended up calming things down, and acting civil to one another - for the sake of my daughter.  She's been with two more boyfriends by then, including a doctor who cheated on his admittedly failing marriage, and they move in together.  I don't say this to judge her, but it plays a part in their (my ex and her boyfriend) dynamic.  They were together for five years, but he never wanted to marry her, or have kids together.  He had one already from the previous marriage (where he got taken to the cleaners), and my daughter, whom he never engaged or attempted to get close to.  This bothered me a great deal, because in my absence, I was hoping he would step up and be a father figure to my little girl.  Instead, he was ""the boyfriend"" who competed with a 7 year old for mommy's attention.  In September of 2010, after 5 years together, they broke up.


In the meantime, I had been bouncing from shitty paying job to shitty paying job.  I sold cars.  I freelanced computer work.  I waited tables.  I made enough to barely get by, but never ahead.  I was constantly a burden to my family because I couldn't land on my feet.  All the bills from the divorce went to collections, and then to court.  I lost pretty much everything I had.  However, things were turning around, and I finally got a place of my own after crashing at my dad's for what seemed like forever.


Enter, the ex.  She calls me crying on a Friday night, saying she had just had an argument with the boyfriend, and needed a place for her and my daughter to stay.  Of course, I offered mine.  Three days later, she's moved in.  Make no mistake though, we are not together, either physically or emotionally.  


Since her departure, I bounced around again, and finally ended up reconnecting with my lost love on Facebook.  She lived out of the country and without getting into the details of her situation, could not drop everything and be with me.  We'd have to work at it, and see each other infrequently, but the fact that we'd rekindled something amazing, it was worth the hassle.  Still, I wasn't making good money, and every day was a struggle, between rent, child support, and food.

In October, I caught a break, and landed a contracting job that would take me overseas for a month or so, but the money was too good to turn down.  I let my ex, and my daughter, have the apartment.  I took off, and upon my return, was offered a job by the same company, but it was 4 hours away.  I said yes, because the money was even better.  This infuriated the ex, because she was getting accustomed to me watching my daughter while she went out, or ""took a break"" from being mommy for a while.  I understood, but I had to do what was best for me.  Child support never stopped, even though they were living with me.  I saw it as my duty.  And even though I live four hours away, I drive up every single weekend to be with my little girl.  My car is 11 years old, and has over 170k miles on it.  I even pay the cable at the apartment.


This brings me to where I am today.  I'm continuing the relationship with my girlfriend, and plan on flying out to see her.  My ex has now become accustomed to my presence on the weekends, and is upset.  She does not approve of the relationship, and uses her failed one as an example of making sacrifices in love for the benefit of our daughter.  Clearly, I disagree that they are similar stories.


Bare in mind, you're only getting my side of the story.  She often complains to me that she is a ""single mom"" with no one to help her, despite having my father only a few doors down, and her parents visiting frequently.  She is now legally bound to where she lives because of a post-judgement agreement that stemmed from her trying to illegally relocate (that's a whole other expensive story), and complains about this frequently.  She wants to relocate to her home town up in New York, although her parents no longer live there, and most of her friends have moved away.  I know, she is unhappy living where she is now, although part of me suspects that she would be unhappy no matter where she is.   My personal opinion is that she believes money is the only thing keeping her from being satisfied and fulfilled as a person, and she feels cheated that neither I as a geek or her ex as a doctor, could provide for her the life she wanted.  I frequently feel sorry for her, because she does make it sound like she is having a difficult go at life.  However, I also think she lacks perspective of how bad things could be, and I believe she takes my financial, emotional and physical contributions towards my daughter, for granted.


With all this being said, am I putting my own career, financial and romantic life ahead of the best interests of my daughter?  Or am I being guilted by a selfish woman who only sees me as a babysitter?  Admittedly, my perspective is skewed, so I'd like some real, honest input from anyone who is willing to contribute.

Thanks for reading."

My GF and I are both in college, having the times of our lives. We're together for almost a year now. I feel like she might be the one and it seems like she feels the same about me.

Being a master student, I was able to apply for an internship abroad. This will take place next summer for 10 weeks or so. I'm not sure yet which country I will work in, but there's a fairly big chance it will be USA or Canada (I'm from Europe). This means I won't see her during that period. At first I was afraid for our relationship, but then I realized 10 weeks apart is not the end of the world and this could be a once in a lifetime experience. So I decided to go for it, submitted my top-3 countries, and I'm currently awaiting response.

A few weeks ago, my GF attended an info session about Erasmus (a European student exchange programme). She heard the first semester of the next academic year would be her last chance to study abroad with this programme. She's currently considering her application for the programme.
Well, I was okay with being apart for 2 months, but if she decides to go for it, we won't see each other for almost half a year. Maybe a visit or 3, but I'm afraid that could not be sufficient. On the other hand, she would do it for the same reason I'm applying. I even think I sort of inspired her not to let go such a chance.

I told her about my concerns, and she's worried just as much as I am. However I never asked her not to do it, since I don't want to be responsible for her regretting such a decision.

Maybe this will have a happy end, and maybe all I need is some confidence about it. But I think my worries are fairly normal, aren't they? So anyone with good advice for my situation? Any stories about couples who survived or did not survive such a long time not seeing each other?

",[deleted],cfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/ew4pe/hey_fellow_cfsers_im_in_a_tough_spot_and_could/,"Here is a background about me, sorry if this is too long.  I've been sick for 9 years (started when I was 19). I was able to finish college because I had over a semesters worth of credits from internships and AP courses in high school; however, I was not able to pursue a career since working full time was not possible for me. I also am extremely symptomatic in the morning and find it impossible to do anything before 2pm (on occasions where I must force myself to be active in the morning it usually takes a day or two to recover). Over the years I found myself in a retail position where I was able to handle 3 days a week (about 15-18 hours) and still have energy to grab dinner with my friends after or leave my house on some days off. I was always frustrated that my income was way below the poverty line, but I have wonderful parents who help support me with food and shelter. 

After 3 years at this job I got extremely frustrated because there was no room for any promotions unless I was able to put in more hours (I tried working 30 hours a few times but felt a crash coming on and had to cut back). Eventually I left and pursued a career in real estate under the assumption that I could work part time and perhaps gain financial independence. This turned out to be a horrible decision. Even though I made some decent money (not nearly enough to move out and be on my own, but more than I had made previously) the hours were more than I could handle, especially since it included earlier hours on the weekends. Eventually I had a horrible relapse with a repeat of a flu-like illness that lasted 6 weeks and left me mostly bedridden for almost 3 months. Since then (2 years ago), I have struggled with various part time jobs where working only 6 hours a week was a huge challenge. 

Last March I tested borderline positive for Lyme disease (all previous tests came back negative). I started antibiotic treatment started feeling better. The improvement wasn't huge, but it allowed me to be active a little each day, even if it was only an hour or two. I was eventually laid off from my job, but was empowered by this new diagnosis and continued on different courses of antibiotics for almost 5 months. I would say the I reached a 40% improvement, but it was still far from a cure. 

At this point I decided to go back to the retail store I had worked at years earlier since I had a good balance there in the past. My plan was to start out part time and eventually work my way up through the company as I started to recover. I started working there about 6 weeks ago and have been on a downhill slope since. They have new rules where I must work at least 3 days a week, and right now that is a huge struggle. I barely have the energy to make it to work and most my days off are spent completely bedridden with headaches, nausea, body aches, and stomach pain that keeps me up at night. I am in so much discomfort after a shift it takes me hours to wind down and often sleeping more than 3 hours at a time is difficult as I'm either woken up by nausea or heart palpitations (my sleep patterns return to normal if I have a few days off in a row to just rest and recover). I have had a day or two where I have felt mostly ok, but am too scared to do anything but rest on those days in order to build up some energy for days where I have to work. 

So my decision is do I quit this job and focus on my health? Or hang in there and hope for the best?

If I quit this job I seem to have nowhere else to go. My resume is all over the place, with stretches of unemployment in between. I don't have the energy to fight for disability benefits, especially since what I qualify for would be extremely low considering I never had a decent paying job. I'd much rather find a part time job I could handle and get out of the house than sit at home and collect a check anyway (plus unemployment almost always leads me to depression). 

The main reason for me wanting to leave is that I currently do not have the energy to keep up with my doctors appointments. During the time I started this new job, my Lyme doctor recommended I try an herbal protocol that helped people where antibiotics failed. I have felt much worse since then, not sure if its because the pills are not working or the job is just beating me down too much. 

My hope was that my body would eventually adjust to these hours and I'd be able to supplement my therapy with acupuncture and Reiki to achieve the balance I had in the past. I am actually scheduled to take a beginners course in Reiki next week. This is going to require me to leave the house 5 days in a row (3 days for the course and then 2 for work), I am hoping the Reiki will work miracles as this is going ot be quite challenge (i have had success with Reiki treatments in the past, this course will teach me to self-treat at home which I can do each day). 

So what are your thoughts? Does it make sense to quit? Am I crazy for thinking I can hang in there and eventually start to feel better?

**TL;DR:** Current job is more than my body can handle at the moment, not sure if I should hang in there and hope I reach a balance or quit with no source of income or foreseeable employment options in the future. "

They were responsible for a great deal of the innovation, both cultural and technological of the last 30 years. Our parents! They invented so much. It was only about 10 years after each of these inventions that they had a re-imagining of each of these ideas. They range from the corporeal to the physical. Examples of each follow:

Seat Belts: remember the crash tests they used to do with live monkey's? 200 frames per second video, super slo-mo crash at 60 MPH with ONLY A CHEST BELT. Naturally, the monkey got decapitated. Most kids my age remember riding in small Ford Sedans where the lap belt was not attached to the across-the-chest belt. Now it's all once piece and thank god. I mean, who the fuck invented the decapitation belt in the first place and thought they did a good job?

Disney Land: this may be a little outside of my time zone but it bears attention. Upon the launch of Disney Land, Walt Disney was so distraught at the quality of service it was able to render to each family, that we went all the way across the country and bought the cheapest land he could in bulk. His intention was to make it way bigger than the one in LA, therefore allowing for more personal comfort.

That would be a shit ton of acres in Central Florida. Swamp land, full of gators, typhoid, mosquitoes and rednecks. He bought the land and built his second miracle. It worked for a while. There were enough trash cans, prices were low and people were happy. Then he died and another invention of the Baby Boomers reared it's ugly head. Corporate America.

Money money, fuck the little man, work 50 years at the same company then get told to piss off with no stock options or pension, unpaid internships and endless commercialism."

Hi

I am a masters student right now and I was applying for summer internships and I want a little help. I studied control systems mainly and now doing research work in power systems (got into it as an application of control, but now its almost all power systems) but before I began school I worked a little in image processing and have a handful of conference publications on that.

I was wondering if including those publications in my resume would help in the internship search now or job later on. I have no published work in my current field. Pretty much everything I did before coming to school is in a different field and without describing that my resume is pretty much just my personal information, it would look sad for someone finishing masters.

I used to do it till now and in the cover letter I used use phrases like diverse knowledge, etc. But now since I am almost fully into power, it doesn't quite feel right. Maybe that also explains why I never got back any replies. It might look like I cannot focus on anything. But honestly, I had an opportunity to work in research field in a good institution so I took the job.

What do you think?

It all started a year ago when I was on my first year in Uni in England and met this girl. We quickly became friends. I never wanted anything more, because I knew she was kinda crazy; she was always getting awfully mad whenever I didn't wanna walk her home from every party and spend a lot of time with her. Needless to say, we stopped hanging out and even talking (couldn't be arsed with non stop drama). 


When we got back on our second year she started calling saying that she wants to meet up and tell me something. She was literally everywhere I was; parties, library - proper stalking. It started to be a little bit annoying so I said I'd meet her, thinking that she'd stop acting crazy. We met in this pub and, what do you know, she didn't say anything at all, as a matter of fact think she believed we were on a date. I met her on this next party (coincidence?) and she told me she's been in love with me for over a year now. I just said some stuff like ''Oh you shouldve told me that earlier, now it's not the same blah blah'' because I didn't wanna hurt her feelings by just saying - you're weird, leave me alone. This was my first mistake.


Few weeks later I saw her on another party and, I dunno how this happend but she ended up coming to my house with few other people for an afterparty. I kept drinking all night and I was really wasted, I even forgot she was there. At 4AM I went upstairs to go to sleep and guess who's lying in my bed? She said she's too drunk and asked if she could stay. I was really drunk and tired so I agreed - second mistake. We started spooning and she started rubbing her ass, then she took her bra off and everything. I was half asleep, but naturally I got a boner. Then she undressed completely and literally took my dick and put it in her fanny. She started moving and basically raping me while I was asleep. (Alright I know you can say that I should've stopped it, but remember the fact I was shitfaced. - third mistake) When we woke up the next day she thought we were a together now and acted like she was my girlfriend. I was paranoid she got pregnant so we bought the morning after pill just in case. 



This is where the crazy part starts. I was about to leave to America, bacause I was accepted on this student exchange program. She came to my house and said that she's got cancer and she will die in four months and I can't leave. Seriously. I knew she was a bit crazy but this is just a complete new level. I knew this story wasn't true because none of her friends, family knew about that. She didn't even go home for Christmas and kept working, she was also telling me about this internship she's gonna have in London in the summer.. That's not something a person with 4 months left would do. After that I decided to stop talking to her for good. On the 31st of January, at 10:30PM she sends me a message saying she did a pregnancy test and it's positive. So she basically ruined my new year's eve. I called her the next day and asked what's she talking about, it can't be possible. I bought two more tests because I needed to be sure she ain't lying. I invited her to my house and asked her to do the test - she wouldn't do it. Then she called me 5 hours before my flight to America that she did another test and it's positive again and she doesn't know what to do. I went to her house even though she was telling me not to and took the tests she did. THEY WERE ALL NEGATIVE. She was even trying to scratch some things off the test so the negative sign looks like positive. I should've called her a crazy lying bitch, but I just walked off with the biggest relief in my life. 


So please, if you don't wanna experience that kinda shit ALWAYS use a condom, or just don't have sex."
ew0jg,3,2011-01-04,Little help with my resume,asdf0123,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/ew0jg/little_help_with_my_resume/,"Hi

I am a masters student right now and I was applying for summer internships and I want a little help. I studied control systems mainly and now doing research work in power systems (got into it as an application of control, but now its almost all power systems) but before I began school I worked a little in image processing and have a handful of conference publications on that. 

I was wondering if including those publications in my resume would help in the internship search now or job later on. I have no published work in my current field. Pretty much everything I did before coming to school is in a different field and without describing that my resume is pretty much just my personal information, it would look sad for someone finishing masters.

I used to do it till now and in the cover letter I used use phrases like diverse knowledge, etc. But now since I am almost fully into power, it doesn't quite feel right. Maybe that also explains why I never got back any replies. It might look like I cannot focus on anything. But honestly, I had an opportunity to work in research field in a good institution so I took the job.

What do you think?"

I've been coding C\C++ for more than two years now, but only as a hobby, mostly in gaming related areas. I'm tired of working at my soul sucking job flipping burgers and I'm ready to do something with my life.

A few of my projects:

**The Anniversary Edition Installer, a mod installer for the game Oni.**
This was coded in C++, using wxWidgets for the UI and boost for filesystem access. I would have used normal Windows APIs, but the code needed to be compilable for Macs, too. How it actually installs modifications isn't a topic I want to get into in this post, but I can on request. 

[Screenshot](http://gumby.oni2.net/AE/aeinstallerscreenshot.jpg)

**The Daodan DLL**

An engine patching DLL for Oni, it is replaces an unneccessary DLL the engine uses and instead patches and hooks the engine for whatever purpose desired. Coded in C, with a bit of assembly for hooks and patches. I'm not the original creator of it, but I am the sole caretaker at the moment. I know the code inside of it pretty well and I've added on several features beyond the original purpose of the DLL, which was to stop a crash caused by OpenGL extensions strings overflowing a fixed buffer.

**Flatline - Oni Multiplayer**

A very educational experiment in networking for me. Using the Daodan DLL as a base, I have started work on Multiplayer for Oni.

[WIP Video 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq6hKFNAnjA)
[WIP Video 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-L8g6UocCo)

Unfortunately the project is on hold at the moment while in talks with a certain company to get actual access to Oni's source. Currently any work done on Oni's engine (multiplayer or otherwise) is done by decompiling and analyzing the engine. Sounds fun, Doesn't it?

**Star Wars: Moviebattles II**

SW: MBII is a total conversion modification for Star Wars: Jedi Academy, which is based on the Q3 engine, written in C. A full description of the game can be found at http://www.moviebattles.com/about

I'm part of the development team. Fun stuff, currently getting prepared for a new content patch within a month. There aren't really any good videos or screenshots of my work on it around. My work there involves a lot of 3D math and such.

First I noticed that many of them have minimum GPA's, my gpa is at about 2.7 because I got a D in circuits and a D in signal processing (I can't stand EE subjects, it's all greek to me!) but have done very well in all my other engineering courses. I have letters of recommendation from my fluid mechanics professor, and my dynamics and ,material science (had him for both and got A's in both classes), do you guys think it would be a waste of time to apply to the internships that have GPA requirements or will my letters of rec. help out any? 

Also many of the applications want a research statement, I was wondering what I should put here? 

Also I would like to hear what internships are like. Are they going to expect me to know a lot about the research subject or is it more of a learning experience? There are a lot of interesting internships I want to study for but I am not confident that I know the material well enough to be able to perform without any help. 

If you guys have any other tips on what I should do to be able to land an internship I will most appreciate it, thanks."

ewqml,32,2011-01-05,Anyone here thinking about going to school for recording/production? Here's what I learned while searching for the program I'm currently in,MistyMountainHop,WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/ewqml/anyone_here_thinking_about_going_to_school_for/,"It seems that every so often, somebody posts on here asking for advice about audio schools. The overwhelming response is usually ""don't bother, learn it yourself"". Books and gear can't replace the knowledge that you get from somebody with lots of experience in the industry. While there are quite a few bad schools out there, there are also some awesome ones.

I'm currently in an engineering/production diploma program at [Nimbus](http://nimbusrecording.com) in Vancouver, Canada. I did a huge amount of research before choosing my program, so these are the things I'd look for in a school:

* **Small class sizes.** There are only five other people in my class, so we all get lots of personal time with the instructor and the gear. You can't really learn audio in a large classroom environment. Your classes should be hands-on, since it's much easier to learn something by doing it rather than watching somebody else do it (or just talk about it).

* **Qualified instructors.** The people teaching you should have lots of experience actually working in the music industry, not just teaching. A big problem with a lot of audio schools is that not enough of what they teach is applicable to real working studio situations. The instructors at Nimbus all have at least 10 years of experience recording (not just teaching), and most of them continue to engineer and produce records.

* **Enthusiastic students.** The school shouldn't be rushing to sign you up as soon as you go in for an interview. A good school should have no trouble attracting students without aggressive marketing and sales tactics (that are unfortunately quite common for this kind of education). It is important that the school only accepts students that are really passionate about making music and really want to be there.

* **Studio time.** You should get plenty of studio time to complete both your school projects and any personal recording projects you want to be involved with. I get at least one six-hour session per week, and often much more than that. I'm actually going in on Saturday to record a jazz-funk trio live off-the-floor.

* **Studios and gear.** While not as important as your instructors, you still need to have good rooms and equipment to work with. The studios themselves should be good acoustic spaces. You should learn how to record, edit and mix in both analogue and digital (or a combination of the two). There should be a great selection of mics, instruments, amplifiers, effects and outboard gear to use (that are all in good working order). You want to be able to transition from school to work as easily as possible, so you should be using what professionals would use.

* **Industry connections.** A diploma or degree really means very little in this industry. What's important are the relationships you build with people. Your school should provide opportunities to help out on real sessions in local recording studios so you can build your own reputation. Internships and job placement programs are also great."

I keep reading that symbolic links and junctions are not supported ""to"" network shares, but I assume this is because of the folder synchronization over the network would normally require something like DFS.  

But... I'm not trying to mirror a local folder to a network folder...I'm wanting to mirror two folders within the same shared drive.





I've read extensively about linkd, mklink, and so on.  I've put together a batch file of mklink commands that could be ran to link the appropriate folders.  I'm thinking I can just have my sys admin run the batch file from the server?  Would someone with admin privs be able to run the batch file from my office?









For example:

C:\            this has windows on it

D:\            this is my dvd rom

I:\             this is the shared drive, hosted 15 miles away, that everyone in the office saves to




I'm not wanting to link a folder in C:\ to something in I:\ , I'm wanting to link ""I:\AwesomeFolder"" to ""I:\IhaveaHat\itsreallyawesome\ireallylikehats""

Neither website is organized all that well, both seem to have similar claims to importance, both have different goals for the new millennium, but both seem to be doing a lot of deep and intricate research.

* A friend of grew up in Florida her entire life.  After she graduated, her mother and step-father split.  They had been together 10+ years, but never married.  She went to live with her mother up north for over a year before deciding to move back down.  She enrolls in UCF and is denied Bright Future.  Furthermore, they decide she is an ""out-of-state"" student and that she must now pay a fortune to attend UCF.  She appeals.  They deny.  She appeals again.  They deny again.  Sometimes they wave part of her tuition.  Sometimes they don't.  I think the girl spent $60-70k to graduate with an B.S. in Biology before she was done.  **tl;dr**- Girl leaves Florida for a year and gets boned on both Bright Future's and in-state tuition, despite the fact that one parent remained in Florida the entire time.

* A friend of mine had put in ""x"" internship hours to complete her Master's.  She already worked in the field.  She submitted her own job for approval as an internship site.  They approved her application.  About mid-way through her final term, they send out an auditor to evaluate her in the work environment.  They conclude that her job isn't up to their standards and require that she start over somewhere else.  Furthermore, the nature of her work meant that alternative sites were not open during hours she wasn't already working.   **tl;dr** - Two months before graduation, UCF decides the internship site they approved isn't good enough.  Student scrambles to complete internship hours while juggling school and full-time work schedule.  

* I've known guys who got back into UCF after being kicked out for a) doing too much Cocaine and b) having so much sex with their girlfriend that they forgot to go to class.  I also know a guy who can't get back in, four years later, because he was denied an independent status on the FAFSA and couldn't get grants or loans.  Dude previously had a 3.8 G.P.A.  He wiped out two semesters later, trying to work enough hours to put himself through school.  It's four years later, and he's reapplied twice.  Can't get back in.  The dude who did too much blow went to rehab and came back in one semester.

**Edit-** I see a lot of posts about the residency thing.  I don't think the girl was surprised to lose Bright Futures.  Her beef is that a) residency rules are pretty arbitrary state-to-state, and b) that UCF didn't handle residency classification according to their own guidelines.

Here's what I know: Her mother moved to Massachusetts less than three months before she did and she got in-state residency at a Mass. university without a problem.  The girl lived her entire life in Florida, and one parent remained here, and she couldn't get Florida residency for **the next three years she attended UCF**.   

UCF could have used professional judgement to re-classify her as a resident.  Especially after a year.   [According to their own guidelines](http://www.catalog.sdes.ucf.edu/student_tuition_and_fees/florida_residency/Default.aspx), they should have done so.  She had florida registration, driver's license, off-campus residence (in her name), florida employment, in-state family, etc.

Forget Bright Futures.  Out-of-state tuition is 3x more expensive than in-state.  They waived some of the tuition some semesters, but it was always a last minute thing.  She didn't always know if she could afford to go full-time until add/drop.  UCF refused to follow their own guidelines, even after documentation and numerous appeals.

eweya,2,2011-01-05,Miss Ex...,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eweya/miss_ex/,"I broke up with my ex-girlfriend of 6 years/ fiancé of 1 year back in August of 2010. 

There was a lot going on at the time

1.) I was graduating college and moving across the country. She was willing to move but was really going to miss her family and home.

2.) I have been dealing with pretty bad iatrogenic medical problems for the last 2 years and I think I am mildly or even majorly depressed. This really impacted my sex life. I am still turned on by her and the female form in general, but I don't have enough energy and desire to have sex. Before my medical problems this wasn't really an issue.

3.) We were fighting over tons of little stuff about our future (I am atheist will I go to church, will our kids go to church, how many kids are we going to have, how big a house, politics). We are really different people, but fighting over this at that time was really stupid looking back at it.

Anyways, I was across the county by myself for an internship and my medical problems continued to get worse. Once we started fighting about all these little things I just felt it wasn't going to work out especially since I really never have enough energy or desire to have sex. For me the relationship had become platonic and I think deep down she held that against me. But she loved me more than anything… she would do anything for me and supported me throughout all our problems. 

But for some reason I felt like I needed to end the relationship. It was the toughest thing I have ever done, mainly because I care so much for her. She took it very hard, and I have been devastated. She didn’t understand and now she basically hates me. 

She was basically my best and only friend and life without her has been incredibly difficult.

I know I fucked up. I will never have a functional relationship because of my medical problems, yet she was willing to accept them and loved me all the same. I know that I damaged our relationship beyond repair and I don’t want to hurt her anymore. 

I have been so lonely these past couple months and knowing that she will be leaving to finish school in a couple days and I will be leaving to my job, and knowing that I probably won’t see her again is killing me. I don’t want to hurt her anymore but I really want to contact her. I miss her. What should I do?"

Naturally, I have gotten broken up with a lot of times because of my accessive studying.   I have decent marks but I feel like a CHILD because I have no life experiences.  My anxiety disorder has not made studying any easier over the years.  I feel burned out, or like I am in a rut.  I am also sick of having no money for fun stuff or adventures because I have to spend it all on tuition.

I find myself extreemly frustrated because I have lost the ability to force myself to study.  I love what I am studying, I am just bored of studying itself!  I want to experience other parts of life than studying.  I have an essay due tomorow and I haven't even started because I am so bored with school that I am having a lot of trouble focusing.

So I will be dropping 2 of my 4 courses because I can't stand it anymore and I want to go to a post-graduate program next january instead of grad school ( I don't need this year's courses for the post grad thing.  Also post graduate programs are shorter and easier than masters programs - yay!).  

I don't really know what I am looking for - advice maybe?  IDK I am just very bored and frustrated and I feel like I haven't really lived my life because I have studied the whole time.  People say ""take a year off and travel or work""  - to that I say: travel with what money?  Also YOU try getting a decent job with a bachelor of arts degree.  I thought I would just work and maybe if I am lucky, do some sort of internship or go to Quebec for some sort of french imersion summer job thing.  IDK.  Also I feel behind in school in general cause of the 2 years I took off for being sick.

I guess there are many posts about long distance relationships, but anyway...

My GF and I are both in college, having the times of our lives. We're together for almost a year now. I feel like she might be the one and it seems like she feels the same about me.

Being a master student, I was able to apply for an internship abroad. This will take place next summer for 10 weeks or so. I'm not sure yet which country I will work in, but there's a fairly big chance it will be USA or Canada (I'm from Europe). This means I won't see her during that period. At first I was afraid for our relationship, but then I realized 10 weeks apart is not the end of the world and this could be a once in a lifetime experience. So I decided to go for it, submitted my top-3 countries, and I'm currently awaiting response.

A few weeks ago, my GF attended an info session about Erasmus (a European student exchange programme). She heard the first semester of the next academic year would be her last chance to study abroad with this programme. She's currently considering her application for the programme.
Well, I was okay with being apart for 2 months, but if she decides to go for it, we won't see each other for almost half a year. Maybe a visit or 3, but I'm afraid that could not be sufficient. On the other hand, she would do it for the same reason I'm applying. I even think I sort of inspired her not to let go such a chance.

I told her about my concerns, and she's worried just as much as I am. However I never asked her not to do it, since I don't want to be responsible for her regretting such a decision.

Maybe this will have a happy end, and maybe all I need is some confidence about it. But I think my worries are fairly normal, aren't they? So anyone with good advice for my situation? Any stories about couples who survived or did not survive such a long time not seeing each other?"

Anyways, she's in the final process of all this, and she just finished a one month internship, and has to present her report before a jury before getting (hopefully) her diploma.

I'd love to get her a really nice printed version of the report. It's not very big (around 40 pages, front only, A4) but I'll be a good symbol of what she's accomplished. And I want to show her how proud of her I am (even though it's not been easy on me neither, since I've had to stay in my current -really lousy- job to support her).

Problem is : I don't know where to order the book! I have her report in .doc, and I'd love to have a print in hardcover, with a good paper. So I'd like you to point out some website where I could order it !

Note : I live in France, hence my bad english, and also I'd like something that wouldn't be too harsh on shipping fees.

I dropped out of college in 2003 and joined the Army in 2005. I spent four years as an Airborne Infantryman and when I get out in May I will have served two years in Special Operations. I have already been accepted at the school I will be going to if I decide to go.

There are a couple different issues I'm thinking about. First, If I finish my degree it will be completely paid for, but my security clearance will expire while I am still in school. I don't expect too many people to know about that one, but if I know the reddit community someone will have an opinion.

I am 27 and have been building computers, diagnosing, repairing, and acting as family and friend tech support since I was 6. I had an internship with a global engineering corporation while I was in high school, and I was showing the IT guys how to do a lot of things (these IT guys didn't know how to use batch files or the command prompt). I was the go to guy in Iraq and Afghanistan for fixing people's DVD players or laptops or TV's or anything else that might be broken. Also, I taught the Special Forces communications sergeants I was working with a lot about networking, linux, and hardware. Problem is, I have no paper stating my qualifications. That's the second thing I've been thinking about. Is there a place someone like me can start and eventually work his way up? Or is this all just stupid and I need to suck it up and spend three years to finish that degree?

I don't necessarily have anything against going to school, but if it's going to put off starting the career I want, why bother?

Thank you for any advice or suggestions."

Recently I have stopped doing this because I have gotten to know many of the employees and interns over the past couple of years and have been lucky enough to be directly involved with their issues. Sometimes I get embarased or nervous telling people that I am an intern there but I fucking hate that. By talking shit about PETA, we are essentially degrading our own cause and clearly that's no going to convince anyone to go vegan, it's not educating curious people and it's certainly not helping the animals. PETA is a media whore because they don't have enough money to show nationwide PSAs, etc. If they did, the FCC probably wouldn't let them on the air anyway. When they have a shot at getting media attention, they have to do everything they can to take it. And honestly, wether you love them or hate them, they are probably the reason you are currently vegan. They are also probably the number one reason veganism has become mainstream. I think we all need to be honest about our thoughts about PETA, and even if you come to the conclusion that you still hate PETA, I think it would be a great idea if we found a way to stay positive about them when confronted. When a meat eater hears a vegan call PETA outlandish or over-the-top, it gives them a reason to view their undercover investigations as a lie, their message as ridiculous and therefore, a sorry excuse to continue supporting animal abuse.

Ask me anything/commiserate.",Blakest1,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ewyl2/iam_a_middle_child_the_brother_of_two_addicts_ask/,"It's been a long story, but it began when I was about ten years old.  My half-brother (six years older than I) struggled with the absence of his biological father, rejecting the best attempts by my own father and turning to marijuana.  No big deal, right?  I would tend to agree.  The only problem was that it didn't stop there.  I recall being about thirteen and having weekly telephone conversations with my brother about his exploits.  He had since moved back to live with his biological father and moved on to drugs like LSD, cocaine, what have you.  These were strange phone calls—a melange of nostalgia, proud boastings about parties attended, and warnings about the dangerous combination of tryptamine psychedelics and apartment balconies.  One thing I remember most clearly is that my brother claimed he would NEVER shoot up.


Of course that turned out to be a lie, and my brother found himself in and out of rehab, and eventually in a comatose state on the floor of his ""friend's"" house, having overdosed on a fentanyl patch which had been punctured with a needle in order to speed things up.  After this incident, he claimed to have suffered from tinnitus (a constant ringing in his ears) and erectile dysfunction, for which he took viagra (he was about 24 at the time, which is my current age).  By this point, I still considered him my brother, almost always omitting the word ""half"" from the hyphenate.  I felt bad for him—he claimed to have spiraled into addiction because of my father's constant badgering and accusations that my brother would ""never amount to anything.""


It could be that this was a self-fulfilling prophecy, but I like to believe that it was simply an apt prediction.  (Here is the point where I would say ""God only knows"" if I were a man of greater faith.)  Shortly after the coma incident, my brother—let's call him Tyler for the sake of discussion—met a nice girl and brought her to my Aunt's wedding.  She was in a nursing program and seemed to hold my brother together very nicely.  (The viagra must have worked for the ED.)


Sadly, Tyler's story is a predictable one, and he soon found himself returning to cocaine—at least that's what he confessed to at the time.    His nice new girlfriend broke ties with him due to a related fight and they parted ways for some time, during which Tyler returned to his old group of friends and, consequently, the drug binges.  Back to the highs, my brother must have forgotten about that girl amidst his many highs.  A year or so later, however, he hit a new low and recalled his lost love—let's cal her Angela.  (Oh, but that's too loaded of a name; I've only used it because it contains many of the same letters as her true identity, so let's just go with it.)


Angela had forgiven Tyler, and before we knew it, they were engaged to be married.  I was selected for the honor of Best Man.  For lack of a better word, this was fucking awesome.  I was proud of my brother for making good on all the times he had told me he would turn himself around.  This was real.


I prepared a toast for his stripperless bachelor party in which I reminisced about the days playing SNES games (he always made fun of me for jumping in real life whenever Mario did)—watching Ultimate Warrior and Bret the Hitman Hart wrestle each other.  In this well-received speech, I recalled how my brother had always tried out such moves as the Boston Crab.  Every time I would scream ""can't breath!"" Tyler would astutely remind me that ""if you can talk, you can breath.""  Sound logic.


The night of that party, just before sunset, Tyler and my friend James had left to buy another keg for the beer pong table—a trip which took much too long.  Shortly after their return, I found Tyler alone in his Trail Blazer, smoking a Parliament light.  I was suspicious at the time but, not wanting to be a buzzkill on his night, I left the issue alone.  I later learned that his lengthy expedition had included a side quest for some blow.  I am no longer on speaking terms with the friend who went with him that night.


Do I need to tell you that the marriage didn't last much over a year?  That should be obvious.  Tyler could not resist his own habits, even with a nurse-wife who craved a fixer-upper type such as my brother.  It was soon revealed to me that Tyler had in fact been shooting up, and that this had been going on for some time—perhaps as far back as his claim that he would ""NEVER shoot up.""


Since then, my brother and I have been in a limbo of fraternity, ignoring each other, reuniting, rinsing, repeating.  It was not until Christmas of 2009 that I swore him off forever, after a promise to send a gift card fell through when he fell out of touch.  Back to rehab we go.


There is more to this particular story, but you can just go back to the previous paragraphs, invent some new names for Angela, insert a child from a previous marriage, and remember to mention this time that Tyler frequently embezzles money from my widowed grandmother.



Then there is my sister.  A full sibling to me, Alexandra and I shared the perfunctory childhood tiffs, but stayed more or less out of the others' business.  It might be relevant to know that Alexandra was a very privileged youngest child and a great success in the Arabian Horse Show world—even receiving fan mail from some of her younger fans.


I suspect that her eating disorder may have been sparked by the aesthetic demands of Equitation, but whatever the case, she eventually decided that she suffered form ADHD and approached our family physician for an Adderall prescription.  I distinctly recall driving her home from school in my Jeep Grand Cherokee, advising her against the use of any amphetamines—prescription or not—in light of our older brother's propensity for addiction.


My advice was flagrantly disregarded, and Alexandra soon became known amongst our overlapping group of friends as the girl who would pay 40 dollars or more *wink wink nudge nudge knowwatimean say no more go no further* for a single pill.  In fact, I was at the bar the day after Christmas, celebrating a friend's birthday when someone asked me how she was and mentioned her notoriety for prostituting herself for amphetamine salts.


An important part of this story is that my sister had, through a series of mishaps, come to live with my girlfriend and myself.  Making herself quite at home, we discovered that many of our video game and DVD cases were empty, and that she had sold the discs in order to buy my mother a Christmas present.  The most sickening piece of this all is that the present was actually a replacement for an expensive photograph print Alexandra had taken from my mother to give to her boyfriend's parents as a gift the previous Christmas.  Worse still, the majority of the things she had stolen actually belonged to my girlfriend, who could not have been prepared for this kind of thing even if she WEREN'T an only child.


It was only tonight, when my parents came to take me to dinner, that I learned Alexandra is moving in with some wealthy family friends who know a ""holistic but NOT holistic"" healer who thinks she can help my sister.  I am pleased to finally have her bedless clusterfuck of a room opened up for more useful things, but I obviously wish things had not unravelled this way.


Me?  I'm currently in my internship year after graduating from a notable state university with honors, an award for Outstanding Student in a Foreign Language, and a member of Phi Beta Kappa.  Sure, I have my addictions—I chain-smoke whenever I write and I am a homebrewer who samples his product every night of the week—but guess what?  I'm on a career path and hope to have a novel completed by the year's end (no, it hardly relates to this story; I'm more the ergodic scientific literature type.)


Still, these things find me at night when I dream about my brother.  One evening we were back at my parents' house, regressed back to our youthful half-innocence and singing harmonies in the kitchen (my brother can't sing a note.)  In another dream, we sat in my Jeep and I held a penny in his face, screaming that it was worth less than his life to him.



So, Reddit, do you have addict siblings?  Friends?  How have you coped?  Have you?


If this experience is foreign to you, what else do you want to know?  There is so much to tell, I could write a book if I were so inclined—but as I said, I am more the ergodic science literature type.  Do your worst.


**Edit**
To everyone who has commented or will comment in the future:
I cannot thank you enough for your thoughtful responses to my story. I have never written at such length about my experiences and your stories, questions, and comments have helped me make sense of it all. I feel deeply for anyone undergoing a similar problem, and wish you all the best. I never expected this discussion to become so prolific—even if there are a thousand other IMAs with a thousand times the upvotes.
I am infinitely grateful for the chance to inspire—and be inspired by—my fellow Redditors. Quite frankly, I had been a lurker until last night when I was suddenly compelled to relate this sordid tale. So thanks again for joining me in the muck.
I haven't, (nor will I ever) escape the addictive tendencies that exist within my family. After all, I am half way through tonight's pack of American Spirits and three beers deep, but I am also a thousand words closer to my novel's completion, and can say with confidence that I changed peoples' lives at my internship today. Thanks again everyone.
I sound like I'm signing off, and that might be the case—the comments have really died down for now—but I hope this discussion continues here or elsewhere. (If I were a man of greater faith, this is the part where I would say God knows...) it will never end, but I have faith that we will find our way."

ey5k5,104,2011-01-07,To all the Redditors writing their representatives- don't bother.,mr_jellyneck,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ey5k5/to_all_the_redditors_writing_their/,"Hello Reddit. I come to you today with a simple piece of advice- don't bother writing your Congressmen or Senators about the issues you care about. I can tell you from my experience as a Capitol Hill intern EXACTLY what happens to your letters and email.

1. Your emails will be put through a filter based on keywords to immediately get through all the form emails (most emails are form emails). These emails are written by interest groups and emailed to their supporters, who send it on to the legislators. When you send us a form email, you're going to get a form letter right back so it's very circle-jerky.
2. Your letters are opened, begrudgingly, by an intern. I suppose if you want to amuse a college graduate playing the odds of getting ""discovered"" by working for free, this is the best way to do it. Otherwise, no member of the staff is going to look at it, not even the legislative aides assigned to that issue area. Hilarious/crazy letters will be laughed at, but only by the lowest of the staffers. Same goes for phone calls.
3. Once the subject of your email or letter is ascertained, you are basically assigned to a form letter. For example, a form letter (a generic letter with noncommital language signed by the legislator) will be written on healthcare *reform for those who support it and those who oppose it. You and dozens of others will get the same letter. The letter is usually written by the legislative coordinator (this is pretty much all they do). Some form letters are written by interns. Check for initials at the bottom of your letters- that's who wrote it, not your representative.

I'll admit I have written to my congressman in the past, but only to see what kind of dodgy response his office would give to an issue that he opposed and I support. You should all know or have realized on your own that the party line matters way more than what you and the other constitutents think, even if you're able to mobilize a large number of people to write about a certain issue. Your efforts are futile, save yourself the stamp.

Feel free to AMAA.

EDIT: Downvote me, write me off, call this post anecdotal, at least now you know how it is.

EDIT 2: Some clarifications.

1. I didn't intend to imply that politicians don't care about their constituents. Go to any district office and you'll see people working their asses off for the constituents. However, they don't read those letters.

2. It's great that some of you got phone calls. You received correspondence to your correspondence. That's pretty much a similar system to what I outlined above. However, maybe your legislator is more adept at speaking to people or maybe you threw them a softball topic that was easy for them to respond to. But all the same, it's good to hear that sometimes legislators go out of their way.

3. If you want to reach your representatives, look for opportunities at home. Town hall meetings or community events may give you access, but it's not a guarantee. And if you get an opportunity to participate in any sort of polling, do it. Letters aren't statistically significant."
ey5h6,8,2011-01-07,"Managers, Bosses, etc; Worst Story about Firing an Employee",[deleted],funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ey5h6/managers_bosses_etc_worst_story_about_firing_an/,"Seems fitting, I will go first.  In college I was an intern manager for Wal-Mart. With this job came many horror stories but one above all else, takes the cake. We had a new employee who was not working out. Late, didn't work, punk in general. The powers that be shy away from conflict and resorted to transferring this new employee around the store rather than firing him. Until one day... 
New Employee is caught on camera taking a frozen pizza out of a fridge and into the break room, doesn't pay. Loss prevention guy has been watching him like a hawk for the day and catches immediately. Me, my manager plus the LP guy confront him in the break room, as he is cooking a frozen pizza in the microwave (imagine digiorno pizza folded up in awful break room microwave) and it's not cooking... of course. We have him red handed so I get to collect the evidence out of the microwave and put it in a plastic bag. He had been suspected of theft so we pressed him on what and how much had he stolen. He plays the ""its my first time, I've never done this"" card and we all are aware it's bullshit. So we call the police. Here is where it gets funky. As we're waiting for the police he says he has to take a dump. We ignore but he continues so we escort him to the bathroom and wait outside. We figure he isn't going anywhere. After a minute, we get impatient and open the door to find a thin layer of water covering the floor and him still in the stall water flowing... We bang on the door. He says ""not finished yet"" words are exchanged and he finally comes out of the stall. In the toilet we find he had been taking all the items he HAD stole that day and was trying to flush them down the toilet...  That seemed to not be working so what does he decide would help? **Taking a shit in the toilet, on-top of the stolen goods, to help push it down!** We are mortified and he is sheepish standing next to his greatest achievement of the day. ""What in the holy fuck are you doing?!?!"" asks my (very conservative) manager.... We haul him back and place safety cones outside the bathroom. 
Police arrive and this kid folds under slight pressure.  Starts rambling all the stuff he could remember stealing in the 3 months he had worked there. He stole a list topping about 2 grand worth BUT the worst was he stole hunting/fishing licenses, Bad mistake as this is a felony (forged state documents and what not). Before the sheriff hauls him off, they let us make him clean out the toilet full of shit and stolen merchandise with a pair of gloves and tongs. He gagged, we chuckled, cops stood with a disapproving look as the watched him clean the toilet out. Thanks Reddit for bringing up these repressed memories!

Dear r/trees

First of, I would like to say sorry to all of you for bringing quite a bit of negative vibe lately, be it comments or just thoughts about what people write - last few weeks were quite shit and I am closed&amp;self-defensive enough to not tell 99.9% of my friends about the most important thoughts/feelings I have.

So. Obviously, the story is about a girl. A girl called Nathalie, who I dearly love and (used to?!) adore. 

""Us"" started more than 2 years ago when I saw her in her first day of university (in which we study together). After that I began considering that there is such thing as love from the first site - we talked for a bit over an hour, while having 20+ people around us, as it was an orientation week ""night-out""; that very night I called my now ex(or maybe ex-ex?)gf of 1.5 years saying that it is over.

It took me a year to get Nathalie. I have tried everything in that year - romance, partying, pick-up (was into that for a few years), ignorance, becoming-friends-route. Nothing seemed to work. A whole school year passed and i stopped trying, over the summer break I had the most fucking memorable summer of my life - an amazing internship, crazy parties on the seaside, clubbing in the best clubs of europe, eurotripping.

I see her again and out of the blue our first meeting in the new school year was like a first date - picture the most cheesy movie, a similar scene - it was like that. 

That year was amazing: we lived together, shared the most intimate things, I told her things noone has ever heard about me (not even my family). Of course, there have been some shitty moments, but overall every single new day of being with her I was getting more and more sure that I want to spend with this girl the rest of my life...and a bit more 

Then there was time for me to graduate and follows my dreams of becoming second Sasha Shulgin and I gave those dreams a rest for a year - the idea of us probably departing for more than a year scared me shitless. The problem was that she went for a half a year internship in mexico and that thing was planned even before we started dating. But oh well ""...half a year of not seeing her and then living together for 6 more months is WAY better than 1 year of being apart...""-, that was my thought process, as I got accepted to a program on the other end of the world and there would have been no way for me to finance travelling from my super short students' budget if I had gone there.

This is when all the trouble started. Yes, exactly, long distance relationship, yadda-yadda-yadda. To cut the crap - she cheated on me and I had to find out about it 2 months later when snooping through her emails. I was shell-shocked, i felt sick to my stomach, I lost 6 kgs in that month, I fucked up everything I was doing at that moment...and I took her back. 

10 days after I took her back, after her long weekend in some godforsaken place, I ask her if she is done anything with anyone there, meaning it as a joke. ""Yes, I made out with this one guy"" 


Fuck

FUCK

FUCKKKK

I will see her in less than 2 weeks, I have already promised her that I would try my best to give it another shot. 

Stupid? maybe

Masochistic? maybe

Wannabe Doormat? maybe

I fucking love her, and never cared about anyone so much. I hate her for hurting me so much, but i cannot imagine being without her. I believe that there is hope and love will find its way, but at the same time I rationally understand that most likely it is over.

I feel like shit, about myself, about her, about us, about what to do.


*(sidenote: I am pretty sure that she love(s/d) me. I was the first guy who made her truly enjoy sex, I was the first guy who she said ""i love you"", i was the first guy that really got through her ""shell""...i guess now she needs to explore...)*

I live in Los Angeles, I'm a senior at USC's film school and there are hardly any paid internships in the entire entertainment industry. I know that there are plenty of people who would work for free, which is why they get away with it. I also read a New York Times article about why it's legal: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/business/03intern.html along with the California labor site.

Yes, this is proper preparation for after college when rich people get ahead, but it gives such an advantage to people who don't have to pay for school like I do. Rent and food are not covered by loans and I'm still keeping my other part-time job while taking classes at night.

Its my first post and I'm about to be 20, and got out of an on/off relationship of 3 years. Lets call her Ivana? Well things ended badly there was just way to much drama and it would never work. Just a huge clusterfuck that needs its own thread by itself. But I still care about her more than any one else in my life. But I just want to be done. Finito.
So I've tried a couple things to get over her. The week after Fall Break.
1.SEX The week after I had sex with 3 girls (no not all at once) and another girl gave me head. All in one week and it sucked. Wasn't anything there. It was just like ""sweet...I had sex in the exact same position I used to fuck Ivana in"" or ""hmmmphf she didn't play with my balls."" And then I realized how much of a critical jack-ass I was so I had another go being more accepting. Nope. nothing doing. It was just not raunchy enough and everytime I'd get aggressive the girls would just love it but never get more agressive. So yeah I'm ruling out that this sex option is not viable to get over Ivana. At least sex with 18 19 and 20 year old sorority/drunk sluts.
2. SPEND TIME ALONE. Yup that was depressing as shit. ""Should I keep her pic in my wallet for winter break, so she will she know how much I care about her?"" ""Maybe we weren't good cause I could only give her an orgasm eating her out and not during sex..."" ""Why did she want to txt so god damn much?"" ""God she's beautiful"" Thoughts left
3. NOT EAT. I was sick to my stomach the day after our  fallouts and I puked in the morning. Just felt bad and didn't eat for 2 days except chicken. Then I realized I was being a pussy and started eating again. I really don't know how girls can do it...
4.STUDY. I'm at a big University in the midwest that prides the fuck outa themselves with academics. So studied my ass off for finals and did well. But I was just depressed. Not having fun. But studying isn't ever fun soo Idk... I'm planning volunteering activities for a community service club and internship apps n being busy doesn't really help.
5. Smoked Weed / Played Call of Duty. I just felt like a slob. When I smoke I eat at least a whole box of cereal + other stuff. And I suck at video games high.
6. Started Boxing. This was actually the only good move. Nothing like getting thowing punches, and getting your ass beat.


So what are YOUR best ways to get over a GF/BF?

p.s. Even though I already tried sex, should I try it with older women, nerdy girls, other girls I haven't had sex before etc?

I got an internship at the German Embassy from 22 August to 21 October. This is pretty sweet, and I am really looking forward to it.


Unfortunately, I have never been to the US or DC before. So I am at a bit of a loss right now. How should I go about finding a place to stay for that time? Ideally, I want to live in a flatshare or something like that, so that I can get to know a bunch of people right away. What parts of town should I go for? My parents are terrified by DC's high crime rate, and I am a little worried as well. Is it really that bad? And what neighborhoods should I avoid?
By the way, the German Embassy's address is 2300 M Street NW, which is pretty much in the centre, as far as I can tell.

Edit: I am a guy, so no all girls housing for me &gt;.&gt;

I will keep you updated, and I might make another post asking about fun things to do in August, September and October later this year.

I took a course load that I loved the next semester, business enterprises, income taxation, ERISA, and I took a criminal procedures class because I thought ""hey, all the cool lawyers on TV are criminal defense attorneys."" Pulled a 3.8, but man, I didn't really understand the weight of the first year. 

Anyway, I kept taking similar classes, all the tax and criminal classes I could, especially the taxation courses geared towards ERISA. 

Anyway, I get a call from the old boss, he wants me to take over compliance on the defined benefits plans because I understand the actuarial and legal side of them. I can work from home, during non-crunch season, it won't take me more than 15 hours a week, during crunch season (about 1 month periods twice a year) the work load will probably hit almost 60 hours. The pay is dependent on how efficiently I can do things, gain new clients and bill. I think the low end is probably 50 grand, high end would only be about 90, and I'd probably need to do more work for that. 

The bright side is that a friend quit his big firm job, started doing solo criminal work and is doing well. His firm had him doing a lawyer on loan with the DA's office when I was there doing a clinic, and he got to watch me try a few cases on my student bar card and wants me to work for him. Up until now he usually pays me about 60 dollars per hour when I do work for him (research, prepping him for trial etc.)

The question is, should I continue to look for a a full-time job (I haven't had much luck in that arena, no law review, no formal internships), or should I stick with this road? 

Sometimes I think ""why do I care if I work at a firm, this would be a pretty nice lifestyle?"" Other times I think I want the security of a steady paycheck. "

---

Well I'm 17 right now, and would like to be in the US by the time I'm 20 (I've set myself a deadline of September 2013). I've been reading up all the FAQs and formal information I can find for almost a year now so I thought I would ask here.

Obviously, I have no qualifications beyond getting Level 1 and Level 2 NCEA (and Level 3 by the end of this year). I've arranged to get some minor qualifications for barista-ing and programming by the end of 2011 and I'm increasing my skills in the computer industry as fast as I am mentally capable.

Being a New Zealand citizen with no family in the US, I cannot get a visa via Refugee status or Family. I want to be able to work (and move as freely as I can between states). Preferably citizenship as well, but I'm aiming more for legally getting into the country for a few years first. I will not be studying in the US, so I cannot apply for a student visa (I couldn't afford the exorbitant fees even if I wanted to study).

I have mainly been using this site for my research: http://www.uscis.gov/
I have not contacted the US Embassy, but can if I need to.

How do you think I should tackle this problem?
Advice and personal experience is very helpful.

I would like to mention that as a teenager, I realise that my quest for actual information would be nigh on impossible for anyone older than me to take me seriously for I am still classified as a child in many, many countries. I want to go to the United States to work, because I know the skills I am training now are in high demand by corporations there. I also want to go there for a personal reason, mainly due to my successful relationship to a US citizen (but that's only a minor reason). I do not want to go there for the 'Television Illusion' that the media of my country happily distort other's minds with. I would stay in my own country for that.

Knowing my young age, I know this is will be incredibly difficult. At this point and time, I can get two options: International Internships or magically getting a Work Offer which would vouch for me.


tl;dr Trying to move from NZ to the US, most options of getting in are ruled out, including Refugee status and moving here as a student.

Thank you, folks."

eynzp,0,2011-01-08,I need a nice way to tell a couple of best guy friends that I am very taken without destroying the friendships.,needs_a_vacation,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eynzp/i_need_a_nice_way_to_tell_a_couple_of_best_guy/,"So here's the situation. (TO NOTE: This is a throwaway account for this question, I am NOT a newbie to Reddit, nor am I fishing for karma or anything else).

Precisely 15 months ago I began dating someone I strongly believe is the one. We met about a week after I arrived at my out-of-state college freshman year. Long story short (since it's not too terribly relevant, but somewhat), I met Dave, fell in love, after a month left an abusive relationship I had suffered through for ~3 years on and off, and hooked up with Dave. Best decision of my life, no questions asked.

But, as most of us know who have been in any relationship of any length, no relationship is perfect. Dave and I have had our ups and downs. No details needed, I'm just stating that while we've had our share of fights, we've worked through our troubles and are still together and in love.

Now, meet Mike and John, both guys I met at college. I'm going to start with John, since he's the one who started this mess.

John is a guy who did me a huge favor at college by helping me with one of my labs. To summarize (I don't want this to be a ridiculously long post, but background is kind of necessary), we became Facebook friends but didn't really start talking until September/October of last year, but ended up being really good friends. Of note, I was going through my first real episode of long distance with Dave, who was doing an internship, and we were fighting a lot (mostly due to my immaturity, I admit). John was a big help during this time, which was also one of the worst quarters I've experienced of college, offering lots of support and such. We talked a lot online, since he was also on an internship. The trouble started when I went to visit him on my way to start my own internship during Thanksgiving break, and his roommate complicated matters by making him admit to being in love with me. There are more details, but you'll have to ask in the comments if you want to know.

Mike I met before Dave, actually (he was my first real friend at college). We became really great friends quickly. Here's the kicker: Mike is a member of my old church, which I have for the most part quit attending (mostly due to the people, not necessarily the beliefs themselves). I guess I should just tell you right out that I was raised a Mormon, and maybe that's why I'm so stuck with how to address this. I'll come back to this. 

Mike went away on a mission (church-related), but I promised to send him letters, since that is the only way anyone but family can communicate (they get to email). Which I have done, though not as frequently as I promised (letters take so much longer to write than you would realize). 
Mike has been pretty convinced that I'm still interested in being a Mormon, but the thing is, I'm really not. I made up a lot of really legitimate excuses for not going to church while he was at college and not on his mission. But I trust Mike, who has never been in the least bit judgmental of anything I’ve ever done, including the fact that I’ve lived with Dave basically since we started dating, or pressured me into going to church or anything, really.

So when John admitted to his undying love for me (I’m not exaggerating, he really did say I was the one for him and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me), stuff happened and eventually I told Dave, and asked him how I should address it. Dave said he was biased, so he didn’t really have any good advice that he could give me. So Dave, who knows Mike, suggested I write to Mike and ask him for advice. So I did, and was totally honest about everything. A few weeks later Mike’s reply came back. Long story short, Mike confessed that he had had feelings for me since we had met, but had kept his distance because I was in that horrible relationship I mentioned earlier; then Dave made his move, and well, Mike thought it best to respect my relationship then, too. So Mike then admits all of this, saying he can’t help, either, because he is biased as well. To top it off, somewhere in my letter to him he got the inference that I was sleeping with Dave, which, up to this point, I believe he did not believe I was doing. He of course did the Mormon missionary thing and flipped out with concern that I was “possibly breaking the Law of Chastity” (aka sex before marriage).

So now I’m stuck. I have three guys head-over-heels in love with me, and I only want one: Dave. But Mike and John are very important to me, and I value their friendship; they’ve been two of my very best friends, and I would hate to lose that. I’ve already lost countless guy friends to the whole “I want to be with you” thing when I was unavailable/uninterested, and I have no idea if it’s possible to avoid it, because I’ve tried every nice way I can think of to address it and failed pretty much every time. Do any of you wiser Redditors have any idea how I can NICELY tell John and Mike I’m not interested, without alienating them? And, above that, how do I address to Mike that yes, I am sleeping with Dave? It’s such an awkward subject that I’m really not at all comfortable with discussing with anyone. It’s a private decision I have made and I am content with. But I’m a terrifically honest person and hate to lie to anyone, let alone my best friend, so I feel like I have to somehow address the issue.

TL;DR: Girl is in a very solid relationship with guy she thinks is the one, but two guy friends have admitted to being in love with her. She needs to know how to address the issue without alienating her friends and at the same time not leading either of them on.

So here it is: **Leave any questions that you would want to ask a California/Non-profit/drug policy advocate insider here, and I will ask them when I talk to Jon**

My initial thoughts were to ask him about:
*Registering a non-profit in California
*Integrating with other advocacy groups
*Whether 501c3 or 501c4 (tax deductable vs. not tax deductable) status matters that much at this point for us, given our fund-raising expectations/goals
*How to best fund-raise, given our goals

* Look at our inner cities. Boy, there is some left wing racism. This is the result of Democrats codling minorities

* The days of heroes vs. cowards have begun!

* Regarding her intern giving her medical treatment: Ha HA !!! Confirmed ?? By a gay propaganda site ??? Very trustworthy !!!

* Hey Yawl, I guess it was OK for Hollywood and Liberals to ask for Bush to be killed. There is nothing wrong with people expressing their opinion

* This guy is a hero who just happens to be GAY and HISPANIC! Way to go Daniel!!

* Obama also has brung dispair and loss of hope in America. Is 99 weeks of unemployment fair to the rest of the country tax payers? Is passing a heath care law that can in any wildest dreams be paid for with out destroying America fair? Dispair is when you see all you worked for going down the drain. Do I believe Obama did this all ""NO"" but he sure has helped.

ez1q5,6,2011-01-09,Venting about being a grown-ass man still forced to go to church.,Anti-Santa,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/ez1q5/venting_about_being_a_grownass_man_still_forced/,"My internship is at a church. I run live sound. Honestly, as far as that part is concerned, I really can't complain. I get experience working with sound equipment, mixing a fairly large band, screwing with microphones, and the other guy I work with is a lot of fun. It's unpaid, but whatever. I get college credit.

The shitty part is the whole church thing. As far as American churches go, this one is fairly liberal (Methodist), but that isn't to say it isn't full of goofy shit. Today was especially awful. There was, I kid you not, a 30 minute long sermon on ""grace"" that had such insightful tidbits as, ""When I thought about it, dog is just god spelled backwards!"" and ""God loves the shooter, he just wishes he didn't do what he did."" During another sermon, the pastor started talking about Prince William's engagement, and then went on an entire rant about how England is still a monarchy, and that people have to ask the Queen permission whenever they want to build a house on their own property. That's why America is the greatest country, you know? God must think so, anyway.

One of the things I've noticed that bothers me is the wage the pastor must make. He always has really nice looking clothes (not cheap Target shit) and I know this is his only job. Today during 'collection' he said, referring to the Methodist church as a whole, ""We're in Haiti, helping build schools, we're out there making a difference."" I couldn't help thinking, well YOU'RE not literally out there. You're asking for money from these people, and you drive a fucking Lexus with your pastor's salary. I'm not saying their church doesn't do any good, they take old clothes and canned food and donate them, but that's pennies compared to this guy's full time job, which is to talk about Jesus and ask for money. No way that shit would fly if it were a nonprofit trying to help the poor.

Anyway, I realize there wasn't much of a point to this, but I got out of there really annoyed today and wanted to say something. Thanks for reading, /r/atheism."

I just found out from a friend who saw her Facebook page that they're married and 28 weeks pregnant, all information they've withheld that I feel would be sort of important for a 'business partner' to know.

I grew up working as a camp counselor and realized that working with kids is something I enjoy. I got contacted by my former boss this week, and they asked me to come work as a director of the camp this summer. I was raised abroad and went to an international school where I had amazing teachers and have always dreamed about being an international teacher myself one day.

The university here (Pitt) offers a 1-year program to get you certified to teach in PA with an internship placement at a school. Do you think doing both of the above would help my prospects at getting a job in education or this is there more I should know about the field before entering? Thanks in advance for advice."

I'm gonna try to keep it as short as I can.

In June I'll be graduating, and to carry on to a masters degree, I will need to do a year of (several) intern ship in my field.

I dream of seeing as much of the world as I can, and this would be an opportunity to live something different in an foreign country.

The problem is that my SO feels likes I will be abandoning her and she is sure i will cheat on her.
The thing is, she is my first girlfriend, and I never cheated on her nor do I intend to.

The other thing is, I might be going there with my best friend, which she hates, and I haven't told her this.

There's a great chance I don't find a job and that I'm unable to go, but I still want to do every thing I can to go there. I just want to have a life with the least bit of regrets, but is it selfish of me to go and leave my girlfriend for 6 months ?"

Ultimately I would like to open up a private practice dealing with marriage and family counseling but I know that's many years off.  I understand that research is big in Grad school, and to be honest would enjoy a career based around that (with a focus on anxiety and depression if possible).  I was told by my advisor that only Ph.D's in clinical psychology allow you to have a private practice so as of now that's what I'm planning on entering into, but I wanted to get as much advice as possible before locking myself into a path.  

Also, for bonus points, in this year off I want to intern or at least volunteer my time in order to gain some work experience and hopefully buff up my App.  Any tips on how to go about that?

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and sorry if it's vague or I left out relevant info.  I was just sitting at home freaking myself out as graduation kept getting nearer and I had no clear idea of what to do afterwards so I needed to do something proactive (even if it's just posting here)."

I've cut all contact, haven't seen her except to collect belongings. I still  love her, she says she still loves me. Reason for the breakup is that she hasn't gotten far enough in life (no internship or job) and the feeling that she needs to sort out personal issues.

Problem is, I think she is doing fine, good grades and working toward her career. Many of her insecurities resulted from me being cold and not opening myself up enough to form a deep connection. 

Having broken our engagement, she feels like she can't come back and needs to complete ""the process"" of being independent. I want to convince her otherwise, if we aren't in a relationship, I know I will permanently cut all contact to avoid pain-this goes against her wish to remain friends.

I know I fucked up royally and likely lost the future I saw with her. My reasoning is that I have nothing to lose, I will never see her again if I can't convince her to try again.

tl,dr; do you try to fix the unfixable?"

Presently I am a second semester Junior studying Economics with a minor in Anthropology. 

I could not have cared very much less in high school, graduating with a 2.9 gpa, a 29 on the ACT, and no idea what I wanted to study in college. Not to boast but i'm a smart guy and could have easily done much better in my GPA. My goal for my first semester of college was to live on my own, so I picked an incredibly tiny, mid-western, state-college (the only college that would offer me a full ride) and took a couple general ED and Bio/Chem courses. During that semester I barely ever touched my homework or studied, finishing with three Ds and an A. I quickly transfered back home and have been attending the university in my city. 

That following semester I discovered one of my passions: Anthropology, and did much better, achieving two As and two Bs. Since then I have been extremely passionate about Economics and decided to change my major. In the semesters since my state-school beginning I have been getting As and Bs, averaging a 3.7 gpa. I have also become pretty active on campus, volunteering in the Anthropology and International Studies departments as well as helping teach English to Saudi transfer students. 

That first semester at the state-college has dragged my college gpa down to a 3.0 and I dont know what to do. I see the people who share my current drive for success and passion for Economics attending large, IVY league schools and getting prestigious internships. I share that same drive academically and have shown it since that awful semester at the state-college. 

What can I do, reddit?! My dream would be to attend Notre Dame's college of business or to enroll in the business college at the University of Columbia in New York for graduate school. I feel as though those chances and any chances of scholarships now or in the future have been crushed by that first semester, two and a half years ago. "

What are some other alternatives of paying for school?",Caked,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eyryk/reddit_i_just_found_out_that_im_3000_short_of/,"I've made a post similar to this before, but this is a specific case. Well, so as to not sound like a lazy bastard, I've worked since I was 16 to pay for car, insurance, school, books, rent, etc. I've basically been independent since I was 16. 

Come college, I have a scholarship that covers partial tuition and I cover the rest via loans and money I've saved. In between now and when I started college, I've done several internships and co-ops which has extended my graduation date and depleted my scholarship funds quicker. So I was notified recently that my scholarship funds are gone, and am in need of a way to pay for school this semester.

I have no money saved up due to rent, food, etc. I'm using the maximum amount of my federal aid loans, no grants as my parents make too much. And lastly, I asked my financial advisors about what my options are and they essentially told me that I could get a ""ParentPLUS"" loan, which requires my parents to cosign, and that's about it.

All I'm asking is possible solutions to my situation. I don't mind going more in debt, but I'm afraid to ask my parents to cosign as they've been fairly distant in financial assistance anyway. I'm not sure where else to turn, I assume my last option would probably be taking a loan from a bank, but I'm not sure where to begin looking for a school loan from a bank.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions/recommendations you can give."

eypzl,12,2011-01-08,Moving to Chicago for a year to work. Have a few questions about what to expect...,friend168,chicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/eypzl/moving_to_chicago_for_a_year_to_work_have_a_few/,"I have some friends over there and have the opportunity to live there for a year. I've decided to take opportunity and will be leaving some time in the summer after my exams. But i have a few questions, and since the people I know don't go on reddit, i figured I'd get honest answers from you guys...

1) i was in Chicago a few years a go with them and noticed a few Irish around. My friends say Irish are welcomed over there by most people. is this true?

2) I'm just finishing my third year of a computer science degree and part of my 12 month visa requirements is that i must work in an industry relative to my studies. Are there many IT jobs/internships in the city? i was on a Chicago jobs site and there seems lots from a company called Allstate.

3)i like to play football/soccer. are there any local amateur leagues, either 5 a side or 11 a side for someone to join?

any insight into what i have to expect would be appreciated. Also, any other tips or hints you think i should know or might help me.

cheers guys :)

EDIT: thanks for all the input guys. you all seem friendly and helpful. I'm looking forward to it much more because of this post.

as far as the Irish question. many Irish people go to Boston when working in the states so i knew there was an Irish community there. it's nice to know Chicago has somewhat of a community too and doesn't mind us going over there, stealing your jobs and women. 

with relation to what type of work i can do, [here is a link](http://www.it-tallaght.ie/FullTimeCourses/Computing/Name,17463,en.html) to the course I'm enrolled in and a list of subjects I've covered near the bottom of the page. by this summer I'll be finished semester 6. there is plenty of coding covered with java being the main language we've done but also c++ and c#. we also have done system analysis and design with UML for the full 3 years and i feel competent in the area too. The web design elements have covered HTML, XML, CSS and ASP.NET amongst others. There's also networking elements covering router configuration, network design and a couple different routing protocols. you can click on he modules to see more detail about any of them. 

I would be happy to work in any IT role that was offered to me and yes ideally near the city center. But it would need to pay a minimum of 750 dollars a month(visa requirements). there are plenty of tech support jobs in Ireland for college students wishing to take a year out so i was thinking maybe something similar but ideally something a little more challenging that would look nice on my CV when I've completed my degree would be preferable. i don't know what kind of money internships over over there, maybe some don't even pay at all. luckily the terms of visa give me up to 2 months to find a placement once I've arrived.

I'm sure a football/soccer game will be easy to find. i watch MLS games over here and the quality of the league has greatly improved over the past few years, in fact you guys played wonderful in the world cup last year and were unlucky to be knocked out the way you were. And having somewhere to watch the European football will be great. i hope to go to a few Chicago Fire games while I'm there if it's not too expensive or difficult to get tickets.

the bike idea suggested by bebob seems like a good idea and I'll certainly look into it if i get a placement within cycling distance.

anyway thanks again for all you comments and information. it's got me more excited about the trip and hopefully I'll have a wonderful year in your city. :)

TL;DR ... Thanks guys, can't wait!"
eypgq,3,2011-01-08,Can't apply to my dream job (FBI Special Agent) for another two and a half years because of one very minor transgression - advice?  Anyone here actually work at the FBI?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eypgq/cant_apply_to_my_dream_job_fbi_special_agent_for/,"I'm a junior in college who just figured out what I wanted to do with my life this year.  I started out as a Finance Major, but then picked up Russian as a Second Major, realized I loved it, and now I hope to eventually work for the FBI as a Language Specialist Special Agent.  I found an opportunity for a paid summer internship where I could shadow a Special Agent for 10 weeks, but as I was filling out the application, I saw that it was an automatic disqualifier for anyone who has smoked pot in the past three years, and they give out polygraph tests.  Last spring, I tried pot for the first time because I was curious what being high felt like, and I did it a second and third time because the first two times I couldn't get high.  This satisfied my curiosity and I haven't done it since.

I decided to not apply because I figured it was better to not apply than to get caught in a lie and close any future doors.  To make things worse, my friend, who has a very similar resume (except I would have had an advantage with my study-abroad experience in Russia), applied and got the internship, which left me happy for him but extremely upset at myself for blowing a huge opportunity.  I now plan to work for the State Department, but I will always keep my eyes on the prize when the damn Statute of Limitations runs out.  For the record, I didn't realize I wanted to work for the FBI until after I had already tried out pot.  Anybody here familiar with the Bureau?

TLDR: Want to work for the FBI/intern there this summer, but trying out pot prevented me from an amazing opportunity, currently kicking myself in the shin everyday."

ezklo,17,2011-01-10,"My First Day in Hell

by Jack Handey",Benny_the_Jew,funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ezklo/my_first_day_in_hell_by_jack_handey/,"My first day in Hell is drawing to a close. They don’t really have a sunset here, but the fires seem to dim a bit, and the screaming gets more subdued. Most of the demons are asleep now, their pointy tails curled up around them. They look so innocent, it’s hard to believe that just a few hours ago they were raping and torturing us.

The day started off at a party at the Chelsea Hotel, where some friends were daring me to do something. The next thing I knew, I was in Hell. At first, it seemed like a dream, but then I remembered that five-Martini dreams are usually a lot worse.

There’s a kind of customs station when you arrive here, where a skeleton in a black robe checks a big book to make sure your name’s there. And as he slowly scans the pages with his bony finger you can’t help thinking, Why does a skeleton need a robe? Especially since it’s so hot. That’s the first thing you notice about Hell, how hot it is. I know it’s a cliché, but it’s true. Fortunately, it’s a steamy, sulfury kind of hot. Like a spa or something.

You might think that people in Hell are all nude. But that’s a myth. You wear what you were last wearing on earth. For instance, I am dressed like the German U-boat captain in the movie “Das Boot,” because that’s what I wore to the party. It’s an easy costume, because all you really need is the hat. The bad part is, people are always asking you who you are, even in Hell. Come on! “Das Boot”!

The food here turns out to be surprisingly good. The trouble is, just about all of it is poisoned. So a few minutes after you finish eating you’re doubled over in agony. The weird thing is, as soon as you recover you’re ready to dig in all over again.

Despite the tasty food and warm weather, there’s a dark side to Hell. For one thing, it’s totally disorganized. That anything gets done down here is a miracle. You’ll be herded along in one big line, then it’ll separate into three lines, then the lines will all come back together again! For no apparent reason! It’s crazy. You try to ask a demon a question, but he just looks at you. I don’t mean to sound prejudiced, but you wonder if they even speak English.

To relieve the boredom, you can throw rocks at other people in line. They just think it was a demon. But I discovered the hard way that the demons don’t like it when they’re beating someone and you join in. 

It’s odd, but Hell can be a lonely place, even with so many people around. They all seem caught up in their own little worlds, running to and fro, wailing and tearing at their hair. You try to make conversation, but you can tell they’re not listening.

A malaise set in within a couple hours of my arriving. I thought getting a job might help. It turns out I have a lot of relatives in Hell, and, using connections, I became the assistant to a demon who pulls people’s teeth out. It wasn’t actually a job, more of an internship. But I was eager. And at first it was kind of interesting. After a while, though, you start asking yourself: Is this what I came to Hell for, to hand different kinds of pliers to a demon? I started wondering if I should even have come to Hell at all. Maybe I should have lived my life differently, and gone to Heaven instead.

I decided I had to get away—the endless lines, the senseless whipping, the forced sing-alongs. You get tired of trying to explain that you’ve already been branded, or that something that big won’t fit in your ear, even with a hammer. I wandered off. I needed some me time. I came to a cave and went inside. Maybe I would find a place to meditate, or some gold nuggets.

That’s when it happened, one of those moments which could only happen in Hell. I saw Satan. Some people have been in Hell for hundreds of years and have never seen Satan, but there he was: he was shorter than I thought he’d be, but he looked pretty good. He was standing on a big rock with his reading glasses on. I think he was practicing a speech. “Hey, Satan,” I yelled out, “how’s it going?” I was immediately set upon by demons. I can’t begin to describe the tortures they inflicted on me, because apparently they are trade secrets. Suffice it to say that, even as you endure all the pain, you find yourself thinking, Wow, how did they think of that?

My stitches are a little itchy, but at least the demons sewed most of my parts back on. More important, my faith in Hell as an exciting place where anything can happen has been restored.

I had better get some rest. They say the bees will be out soon and that it’s hard to sleep with the constant stinging. I lost my internship, but I was told I can reapply in a hundred years. Meanwhile, I’ve been assigned to a construction crew. Tomorrow we’re supposed to build a huge monolith, then take picks and shovels and tear it down, then beat each other to death. It sounds pointless to me, but what do I know. I’m new here."
ez9wm,6,2011-01-09,I've worked in 6 US House of Rep campaign offices and 1 US Senate campaign office. There is almost never any security. ,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ez9wm/ive_worked_in_6_us_house_of_rep_campaign_offices/,"I work as a fundraising consultant. When the official is in their office, pretty much anyone could walk in and see them at any time.

They'll probably have a BBQ at some point and you can walk right up to them. No security, no searches, just a sign in table manned by an intern.

When one of my candidates won his Congressional bid, his security for the night was the freaking hotel security that escorted him through the crowd of the hotel ballroom. That's it.

Governors always have 2 state troopers with them from what I've seen.

My co-workers and I have commented on lack of security a bunch of times. We'd say something like ""Isn't it weird that basically anyone could just walk right up to the candidate and stab them or something?""

Long post incoming, TL;DR at the bottom

I've been lurking for quite some time and today I need some advice, some context :

I'm a 28yo guy, not really the poster boy for alphaness per se (I'm short and look nothing like johnny depp :p), but being very confident and witty I never had any problems with girls.

I've not been in a LTR for some years, not willing to commit I prefered some short relationships but this is changing now and I'm looking for someone.

So I met a girl at work, younger than me (23) quite pretty and smart she's on an internship in HR for a year we're both hard workers so we only had a few interactions and they were only work related.

This changed about 3 weeks ago at a company dinner, she asked me if I knew how to dance, I replied that I only knew how to waltz (as I knew she played classical music) and she seemed quite pleased as she said (loosely translated) that ""it didn't reach a deaf ear"", sadly we didn't get the occasion to dance because the restaurant/bar/club closed as we just finished eating and we went seperate ways.

Since then she's been more friendly with me at work, we still don't see each other a lot because of the work, and because she's only there two days per week, but when we do see each other she smiles a lot, kino here and there, maintained eye contact, asking questions about me, well multiple IOI's.

But (you were waiting for this ""but"" :p) two problems :

- She seems to have a boyfriend, at least says her facebook page, not my style to background check her so I left it at that
- She works in HR :|

So that's where I need your advice, let it be clear that I don't fear being rejected but I'm in a limbo :

I don't want to nick my reputation at work, I've heard many times that relationships are no good at work, never experienced it the hard way (nor in any way), her talking about it with her/my boss would be an obviously bad thing.
I want it to be a LTR if possible, so her having a bf feels like i'm heading for the wall.

In any way I have to take a decision (giving up or getting frienzoned obviously not being options)

What should I do ? should I ask her out bluntly ? just asking for her number ? wait till her internship nearly finishes ? (10 f'ing monthes ...), 
This is a total unknown territory for me, I mean usually if I screw up, or be rejected or anything there are no consequences and I can instantly move on but that's not the case here and I was hoping someone would've had some advice about it, anything will be welcome

Thanks a lot for having read me

TL;DR : I want a LTR with an intern who works in HR in my company, getting multiple IOI's but she has a boyfriend and I don't want to screw my position up in the company, need some advice on what to do about it, thanks a lot "

Hernandez is an active leader of the United States Student Association, the country's oldest and largest national student-led organization, representing over 4.5 million students at more than 400 campuses across the nation.

He pulled her into his lap, holding her upright so she wouldn't choke on her own blood. She was conscious, but unresponsive. Hernandez never let go of her and stayed with her until the paramedics arrived. He climbed into the ambulance and held Giffords' hand the whole ride to the hospital, where he remained as she went into emergency surgery. USSA President Linda McCluskey called the hero, who is a trainer in the organization's Electoral Action Program, ""the intern credited with saving Congresswoman Giffords' life.""

I've been interning with this company since August. I was supposed to be done in December, but then they asked if I wouldn't mind staying on until May (at which point there might be a full-paying position available), and I agreed since I didn't have any other job prospects. (Should probably mention that I moved halfway across the country for this internship and subsequently fell in love with the area and don't particularly want to go home and move in with my parents)

They are taking advantage of me, and we both know it- it has been a while since I have actually been an ""intern,"" especially since I'm one of the few in the building that know my way around a computer and often end up being tech support for the whole building. I haven't made a big deal out of it before because it's a brand I've been really loyal to since I was a little kid and because the company is in the middle of restructuring itself so it doesn't go bankrupt.

That said, I do really enjoy the job and the company I'm working for, but I can't continue to live on $7.25 and hour in one of the most expensive areas of the country.

I am actively looking/interviewing for other jobs, but in the meantime, does anyone have any advice on how to tactfully approach the subject with the CEO that they need to either nut up or shut up when it comes to paying me?"

I stumbled upon r/resumes, read around and found a huge load of useful advice here. I want to express my thanks to you all!

My situation is the following:
- Im attending uni, 4th semester of my BA in Philosophy.
- While in school, i somehow managed to do not even one internship, job, or whatsoever. Went to uni straight after finishing my A level.
- Now working as an assistant at uni, my tasks there vary from assisting lecturers in whatever they might need, doing administrative work (daily business, assistance, stand-in when needed), and so on.
- I am quite active in our student council.

My intention is to find serious employment. I love challenges and diversion and am quite capable when it comes to administrative and organisational tasks. In addition, economics tend to stir up a lot of interest.
The first step now is to find a serious internship in which I want to learn quite a lot. 

So that is where I'd really like your advice, reddit.
I think I'm doing quite well portraying the things I did within the past two years, possible because I really did a lot of interesting things and learned a lot of useful skills. 
But I cannot really think of a good way to outline my pre-uni career (which is, as you read above, absolutely none) without letting it put me in a bad light.

Do you have any advice on how to improve my resume?
Thanks in advance, reddit :)"
f03rm,1,2011-01-11,"Thinking about getting engaged. No, I WANT to get engaged! I need of some... comments, ideas or help?!?",KaYoUx,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/f03rm/thinking_about_getting_engaged_no_i_want_to_get/,"Soooo... I've been in couples for a really long time in my life. Two times it lasted more than four years, but the girls and I were young so we split up. I met this girl, Marilyn, ten months ago and it's been perfect. I've got a bit of experience in relationships and, even if I may sound cheesy, I know she the One! Although we're still a young couple, we both told the other that we would like to get married to each other when we'd have the cash. See, she's 23 and I'm 28, but we both are finishing our degrees, so we're a little bit out of cash. We both are really involved in our relationship and we both lived our experiences with love. I know she means it when she speaks about getting married with, having childrens and all the stuff and I mean it too.

BTW sorry for my english, I'm from Quebec so it's a bit rusty!

SO... sorry for the introduction, but I just wanted things to be clear. I'm not totally blinded by my love for this wonderful woman. Our relationship's pretty serious and it makes us both very happy. 
We already lived together and it was great, but during our internship, we live in different cities. We'll move together in July. We also went on a bit roadtrip together and it went really well. We're able to speak easily about everything, and we've got the same values. We never got in a fight because both of us are very communicative...

Now I know that she does not want to get married right now because we'll have almost no money while we pay our debts back. We're teachers, so we wont be that poor, it'll just take some years before we finish paying it up. She does want to get married, but she wants to do it right since her brother married without telling anyone in his family and she does not want to do that.

Sooo... I though about it and, even if we almost did it, I'm starting to want to get engaged with her. It'll be the promise of our future marriage and I *think* that she'd say yes.

So I need some feedback here. What do you think about engagement? Should I wait a bit longer or do it? I just don'T want to lose her over that, but I don't think I would. I'm just sacred she'd say no... (I think it's pretty normal to feel that, but still...).

Anybody got great engagement stories to pump me up? Any way I should do it? Should I wait? What about the ring?

Any reason why I shuold NOT do it? Any doubts I should be having? I'm pretty sure of myself, but I wanna be sure that it's an important moment in our lives.

I'm going crazy right here! I know I'm not making a lot of sense but I really need some feedback, boys and girls!

Anyway, for those who'll read this post and try an answer, THANK YOU. :)

***EDIT*** I was wondering how much time people wait before deciding to do this engagement? After the 1 year anniversary? Or when they just feel it in their gut?"
f02cb,2,2011-01-11,"got kicked out of uni for shitty grades, no idea what to do now. Anyone been in this situation? Have any advice?",thrownawayfromschool,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f02cb/got_kicked_out_of_uni_for_shitty_grades_no_idea/,"I've been doing pretty shitty in school lately. My frosh year I did pretty well, got a 3.8 or so in Computer Engineering and transferred to a much better university. Didn't do so well there for a combination of reasons my first semester and got about a 1.8. The next spring, I was doing so poorly that I withdrew from all of my classes. I still got a pretty good internship for the summer, made a pretty good bundle of money, and was asked to return the next summer. When I returned to school this past fall, I got a 1.0 and was dismissed from the university. 

I'm not going to blame anything or anyone for how this happened. Suffice it to say I've been in a pretty bad place lately in my life and I feel like nothing has good has been happening in my life. One of my best friends committed suicide, I found out my mom is sleeping around, I was in a pretty shitty and stressful relationship until about a week ago, and I'm pretty much broke. 

Honestly, I didn't really know that I was dropped until today. I came back for school a little bit early (a week before) so that I wouldn't have to unpack everything right as classes were starting, but then I get a letter from the school (as do my parents) notifying me of my dismissal. Now I have to pack my whole room up and leave for good.

The letter says that I can't even re-apply until next spring. I don't know what I'm going to do until then... My parents told me that it would be OK for me to stay at their place indefinitely but I don't want to be an unproductive leech forever... Honestly I've considered joining the armed forces or something like that because I don't feel like I have much direction in my life, just a bunch of people that have really high expectations of me. I don't know what I want to do with my life or anything and it is finally catching up with me.

This is probably the shittiest situation I've ever been in, and that's saying a lot. I've never been at such a complete loss as to what to do in my whole life and it makes me feel so useless and stupid that I got myself into this mess. I feel like I've let everyone who cares about me down, as well as myself, and now that this has transpired my life is irreparably fucked. Not having a degree means it is impossible for me to get any jobs in my field so I probably am gonna end up doing something I feel no passion for or am completely uninterested in. 

There's nothing I can do about getting kicked out of school directly right now but does anyone have any advice on what to do?  

tl;dr: got kicked out of school, no idea what to do next, any advice/help?

f019q,8,2011-01-11,"I may have the opportunity to return to college soon. Does anyone have opinions on what courses or degrees are worthwhile from a ""collapse"" perspective?",NoMoreNicksLeft,collapse,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/f019q/i_may_have_the_opportunity_to_return_to_college/,"First off, I'm not spending any (much, anyway) money. I've been hired on by a local university for a job in the field that I've worked in for 12 years or so at this point. One of the benefits is that I get free tuition.

There are several catches. I get one course per term (3 terms per year). I do have to pay for books. And I have to be enrolled in a degree program.

Now, here's the kicker... at 120 credit hours for a degree, it would take 13 years to complete one. However, it's not like if after 8 years I've not completed it that they'll back-bill me. And I wouldn't be in this to get the college degree I've never had (not without picking up some scholarships or Pell grants to cover extra tuition). This doesn't bother me too much. However, it does mean that if I just want to pick up courses adhoc, I only have 11 credit hours of electives to work with.

My first thoughts are a BS in horticulture: http://www.pssc.ttu.edu/ProgramPages/Horticulture_Cir.php

Quite a few courses in animal science (agriculture) look interesting as well, more of them than I might take as electives. There are even a few senior year courses in natural resource management worth considering (aquaculture in particular). There are the occasional courses in things like food science (dairy and cheese production?) that would also be pretty neat if they didn't use up my electives so quickly. 

I don't expect any of this to get me a job (I already have one of those). But I could learn a few things that I don't know yet, and I feel like it would be dumb to waste the chance.

There are a few things I will rule out. I'm not going to do pre-vet... while I could no doubt manage that, I don't think I'd test spectacularly high at the vet school entrance exam. And even if I was accepted, I can't afford it. And it would mean moving... there are none local. So that's out. Similar reasons apply to all the other non-agriculture programs that I might dream about pursuing (pre-med). Engineering and chemistry are also probably out... just not enough pay-off. The things that might be useful in those fields are learned in the internships and research positions and so forth, and I'll never get that far.

So, does anyone have an opinion?"

In order to get a leg up on my counterparts, I accepted an inner-city internship that emotionally drained me and taught me to move quickly, but to manage a classroom effectively. I graduated with a 3.7, so book smarts aren't the problem.

I volunteered at least 20 hours a week at a boarding school for displaced-inner-city students, doing private tutoring and teacher aide work. I have also done private tutoring for compensation. Currently I'm employed by 3 different districts as a daily substitute. *I'm good at what I do.*

Where I seem to be flailing miserably is further interviews. Within the districts I already sub in I have filled out over a dozen long-term sub and teaching applications and have followed up on several of them with phone calls. I haven't heard back about any of them, aside from the electronically-submitted confirmation email. 

My resume and cover letters are professional. I have polite speaking skills in Spanish and French. I *don't* have many references. The school that I did all my volunteering at shut down due to state funding, so the references I have from there are now dead-ends. I haven't subbed for anyone long enough to ask for a reference. 

My student loans are kicking in full-blast and I'd LOVE to finally be able to move out of my parents house. I NEED a full-time or long-term position desperately.

f0tc8,0,2011-01-12,"I screwed up my first 2 years of college. Even though I'm improving, how screwed am I for grad school?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f0tc8/i_screwed_up_my_first_2_years_of_college_even/,"Background: I'm currently a Computer Science major at a fairly renown school (I would say 1st-tier.). I was a bad student during my first two years and I have no excuse for it. My GPA sank down to a 2.5 at one point and almost got me kicked out of ROTC. Starting my third year I started to harden up although the process has been painful and gradual since. I'm going to graduate in May and head off to the Air Force doing Operations Research, but I would like to apply to a tier-1 (say...top 50?) graduate school in Computer Science, IT, or the like. I evaluated the pluses and minuses of my situation as follows:

Plus: 

* I have a decent internship doing network security at our school's applied research labs. NetSec is the field I'm interested in, and I am in very good standing w/ my boss.
* In addition to my degree I will have 2 certifications in Health IT (accredited by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology), and INFOSEC (accredited by the NSA).
* My last 2.5 years GPA will be above a 3.0 assuming I get at least a 3.1 this coming semester. If I get a 3.5 this semester my last 2.5 years will be ~3.2
* If I choose to wait until I exit active-duty, I will have 4 years .mil experience and TS-level clearance.

Minus:

* I screwed up pretty badly. My semester GPAs since my freshman year were: 1.92, 2.12, 2.63, 1.53, 2.92, 2.25, 3.15, 2.75, 3.42. I loaded myself with a lot of upper-div and rather difficult CS classes but I can't make that an excuse for myself.
* My official transcript from my school shows that I'm currently at a 2.7 (I know the #s don't sound like they add up but I transferred a lot of AP credit when I started), but my military education transcript shows that I have a 2.8 (the .mil counts more transfer classes than my school). At best I'll have a 2.9 cumulative GPA according to the military when I graduate, far from a 3.0 cutoff.

The school I am most interested in applying right now is Virginia Tech's Masters in Information Technology. Their minimum requirements are &gt;3.0 GPA in last 60 semester hours, no GRE, and 3 letters of recommendation (http://www.vtmit.vt.edu/admission/). I would apply to other schools but doing grad school while in the military gives me few options, and I would like to get a Masters before I leave active duty.

Give it to me straight, Reddit. Am I completely screwed or is there hope? If I give up going to a tier-1 grad school and instead go to a tier-2 grad school will it even be worth the education?"

So i've decided to start searching for summer internships and was wondering if you happened to know of any good places to look. I've already searched through the majority of the ones posted on my University's website, but very few are open to freshman or sophomore students. 

Any tips?

I've been off and on adderall. At first it helped, but then it just exposed that (on or off adderall) I feel like getting myself to start homework is like a fight with a bratty inner child. I know what I have to do but I feel like I'm kicking and screaming not to do it. The irritating part is that when I don't do my homework, half the time I end up studying something with problems very similar to my homework... studying control theory instead of doing my linear algebra homework or something. My grades are in the shitter.

Someone jokingly called me fat... and people assure me I'm not, but still I went home and cried about it.

I have an incredibly hard time waking up in the morning. I've tried going to bed early... no dice... I'll go to bed at 10:00 PM, wake up at 9:00 AM, and set the alarm 15 minutes forward, wake up, do it over again 12 times until it's 12:00. I just really don't want to be awake.

I have notebooks full of designs for projects and ideas and a fully stocked shop that I built with internship money. It only gets use when I have an obligation to build something for someone else."
f0lcl,1,2011-01-11,I wrote my senator about the tax cut extension bill passed in September; he wrote me back today,bmct,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/f0lcl/i_wrote_my_senator_about_the_tax_cut_extension/,"Edit: apparently I'm still figuring out how to post links. [Here's the link to the email](http://i.imgur.com/faqxE.png)

Back in December, I wrote both of my senators urging them to not vote for the tax cut extensions for the wealthy. While I understand that the bill also extended benefits for some people who really needed them, it is my belief that holding these ransom in order to line the pockets of wealthy constituents is fundamentally wrong. All I have to say is: Right on Senator Levin!

[Here's a link to a summary of the bill, including voting records and analysis](http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/111_PL_111-312.html). Notice that the title of the measure is ""Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2010, Part III."" You have to wonder at a system where decisions of import have to be greased through in such an unrelated manner. 

In case you were curious, my other Senator, Debbie Stabenow, voted in favor of the bill. She also wrote me and explained she did so in order to maintain the unemployment benefits in the bill. I am willing to post her less awesome response for those who are curious.

And yes, I am aware that these are almost certainly written by an aide or intern. I am simply applauding my senator and the attention his team gave to my concern."

I grew up poor, but OK. The neighborhood wasn't great and I mostly raised myself through the crucial years to the point where extended family is so proud that I just didn't end up in Jail. I was raised to appreciate a dollar and equate most things to currency (You better eath that! Theres 32 cent worth of chicken on that BONE). What this did for me is create a paranoia when it comes to debt that is unfortunate considering the situation I'm in.

I graduated from highschool in 2002 and went to community college to get a certificate in local area network administration while getting the Collegiate basics out of the way. Once I completed my coursework there I went to University in 2005 and thats where the trouble started. 

First off I didn't have a car, extensive family or any money. Second the school I got accepted to was 80 miles away and in a relatively remote location (important when it comes to working on the side). At the behest of friends I bit the bullet and borrowed. It worked out OK but I was never able to really work because I didn't have a car and I was studying Engineering which took up a massive amount of time. As the debt grew I just cringed and told myself ""You'll be pulling in 4-6 grand a month starting so do what you have to and get it done"".

Fast Forward to graduation in December of 2008, I think only 40 of us crossed the stage with that piece of paper that says Electrical Engineering on it. This picked up my spirits considering that after I left that stage I was going to have only two things in my life, that piece of paper and the bill for it, and I would need a job to pay for it. Less competition means more opportunity but since I didn't do any internships and I didn't have a job lined up, I moved back to my home town which is known for having a good economy and a LOT of tech companies with a plan to apply and get hired somewhere. At this point I had virtually no support from family and very little friends, the only things I owned were my clothes and a computer.

Obviously things got rough, some of my fellow grads got jobs others didn't, I was one of the ones who didn't and I applied and looked for the first 8 months. By this time my benefactor/friend who was letting me stay on her couch started to get a little tired of me so I switched gears and started looking for ANY professional Job I could find.

Now, almost 2 years since I graduated with a degree in electrical engineering and 6 since I obtained a certificate in network administration, I'm sitting at my desk as a HelpDesk technician making 20 an hour to interpret user's technical issues and either assign them to the correct department or change their password. Lame I know. 


With all of that written here's the situation:

I'm drowning, slowly sinking deeper into debt whenever an extenuating circumstance comes along. 

I've tried to tell myself its not so bad and that I can make it but the Idea of owing so much prevents me from feeling good about anything I buy. I don't feel like I'm accomplishing any goals as numbers continue to rise and things I need continue to pop up. My long term plan is to 
pass the Fundamentals of Engineering exam and start reapplying but at this stage in life the emotions surrounding this debt might kill me first.

So what I've decided to do is bear it all to anyone willing to look so I can get a read on whats happening. The first time I thought of making this post I stopped because I felt like if I just watched my money better I would see the answer so I started up mint.com (they FINALLY interface with my credit union) and tracked my spending from July of this year to today. What I've learned is that I still can't SEE an  answer in it outside from make more money. So here I am, asking for input on how to maintain some semblence of a life while paying back what I owe. I want to be rich and I want to do it the long slow way, but at this pace I'll be 60 before I break even.

Lets start with income: I take home aprox 2400 a month from my 8-5, its very stable, the benefits are good, and its pretty brainless for me (I'm trying hard not to mess up do to lack of motivation). On the side and from 5-9 I work teaching computer classes for a non-profit, sometimes I get a ton of classes sometimes I get none. Over the past few months I've been able to get at least 2 a month and each one week class pays about 300.

so in review the Income is 2400 a month plus a supplemented 300-800 depending.

Next is how I spend which can be discerned from the information I've been collecting from mint.com: 

Debts:

  * College Bank Loan (10%)           - 3400.45   - 168 a month
  * College Private Loan (5-8%)       - 35828.54 - 270 a month
  * College Public Loan (5-8%) 	 - 42000      - 200 a month
  * College Citi Credit Card              - 8150.45   - 162 a month
     (Closed and locked in at 11%)
  * Visa Credit Card - 2196 -60 a month or the min
     (18-26% Var)
  * Discover Credit Card	 - 1472.77 - 50 a month or the min
     (19-24% Var) 
  * Old College Apt Complex - 2000	- In Collections
  * Very old Dr. Bil - 80 - In Collections
  * Recent Gall Bladder Surgery - 500+ - Havent Started Paying

TOTAL DEBT = $95628.21+ - 1000+ Monthly


Bills:

 * Phone and Internet - 140
 * Rent &amp;	Utils - 550
 * Electricity - 80 Aprox
 * Car Payment - 390
 * Car Insurance Payment - 155

TOTAL BILLS = $1315 Monthly

Variable monthly Expenses (Based on 6 month Avg presented as min/avg/max)

 * Food	- 255/378/380
 * Gas - 75/137/205
 * Entertainment - 159/325.20/479

TOTAL EVERYTHING = 489/840.2/1064 Monthly

So all in all I NEED somewhere between 2800 and 3400 a month to maintain my current lifestyle. Unfortuneately I'm a little short.

Mint.com says that over the 5 month period I've spent an average of 3312 a month. The least i've spent is 2725, and the max 3875. Right now I'm thinking this is my best option, to devote my attention to more money making schemes BUT I believe that if I can incorporate some money saving schemes as well I'll be in a good position. 

Frankly I'm tired of not being able to buy new clothes or furniture (still have my college clothes some donated by frat brothers thank goodness, which some were my highschool clothes, and my furniture is a futon and bookcase both donated), go out the way I would like, or build any savings. I feel like 40K should be enough for anyone to get by enjoyably but not with this soul crushing debt, I honestly feel and live like some of my friends who never went to school and work minimum wage. The only difference is I don't have a roommate and my car (its only a sentra and I doubt that purchase more and more) is new, outside of that I can sit around and commiserate with my friends about money all day.

Constructive Criticism, Advice, directions to a good loan consolidator, anything would be greatly appreciated.

He was constantly looking for someone else and in the past few days he made a new OkCupid account and has been obsessing over it. He spent hours analyzing every word and picture. 

In the past week, this has really started to hurt. Everytime he talked about finding someone else, I wanted to go curl up in a cave. 

I told him that I wasn't happy with an open relationship anymore, and that it was making insecure and unhappy. His only response was to tell me to leave and then he turned back to his computer while I packed my stuff. His abrupt cut off was cold and possibly hurts the most. It felt like he didn't care at all.

I feel like I need to make changes, because I'm obviously not getting what I want out of life with my current trajectory. It's been 12 hours and I've already joined a gym, gotten a haircut, and sent out my resume for summer internships.

I *know* I did the right thing, but right now I'm crying and all I can think is WTF did I do?! I feel alone and want nothing more than to go back. How do I stop myself from doing something stupid in a moment of weakness?

I have just started to work as IT support for a mid sized company and they want a computer for their intern. I don't have the authority to order a new one so instead I must bring life to the ones we have. I have:  
- Fujitsu AMILO pro (x2, no power adapter, unknown error)  
- Fujitsu ESPRIMO Mobile (no power adapter, unknown error)  
- HP 2230s (no harddrive)  
- HP Compaq nx6325 (no keyboard, Fujitsu harddrive, unknown error)  
- HP ProBook 5310m (no harddrive, unknown error)  
- IBM Thinkpad R52 (misssing keys, taped, melted spots ...probably a gooner)  
- 2 USB sticks (4 GB each, one of them have Ubuntu)  
- A bunch of Installations disks for Windows XP, Win7 and OSX.  
- A bunch of other IT stuff like tools, network cable etc...  
  
I have put a Fujitsu disk into the HP 2230s and installed Win XP. It broke after windows update so I tried Win7 which breaks in the installation because of the foreign disk. Lastly, I have managed to boot up Ubuntu from USB stick but it wont run when installed on harddrive.  
  
I don't think the users would like to run Ubuntu on try mode. So what should I do? Go back to unpatched Win XP?  
  
EDIT: Like I wrote in a comment below: ""The previous IT guy is on vacation so I am alone for just two weeks. It's not as bad as it sounds. I could probably just tell them that we have no computers and that they need to order a new one if they really needs it. This is more like a pet project for me to get new knowledge while I have no other case to work with. I might be a little bit petty against this user as well since they ""lost"" their last intern computer.""

I have installed win XP again and it seems to run fine. It got SP3 but I will turn off automatic updates and install anti-virus.

Obviously, I hope to tailor this to the jobs that I am applying for, but there is a big difference between going in depth about two positions, versus including four.

Also, I am uncertain about how to include pieces that I have authored, since this is a resume rather than academic CV (e.g. consulting reports, research articles).  Simply as a subset of my education?  Or a separate section?

f23z0,1,2011-01-14,Question regarding college classes...,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/f23z0/question_regarding_college_classes/,"I'm currently a freshman in a business college. This spring, I'll be taking an introductory psychology class, a macroeconomics class, a meteorology class (gets the physical and environmental reqs out of the way), and an accounting class.

Being in the business school, there's this program that all the sophomore business students take in either their fall or spring semester that requires sophomores to ALREADY have taken accounting and business statistics. Therefore, I'll have to take business statistics at some point before enrolling in the program.

Here's my question: Should I drop the introductory psychology class and take accounting and business statistics together so I can enroll in the program next year right away? My advisor doesn't recommend any freshman doing so because it is quite a workload, but I was also considering searching for internships (possibly IT-related) this summer so I think having a little business statistics background would help.

The advisor recommends I just stick with my current schedule and take business statistics fall of sophomore year and then do the program the following spring. But in doing so, I feel I'll be missing out on any possible internships (who knows, I could find one) this summer.

My last option is to stick with the current schedule and then take business statistics (as well as possibly an internship) over the summer.

P.S., Anyone have any tips or information regarding IT internships? I don't wanna start it after junior or senior year because I feel by then it'll be a bit late. And please tell me if I'm overdoing myself.

Thanks a bunch."

There is a ""Two-year Home-Country Physical Presence Requirement"" for J-1 visas stating that ""An exchange visitor is subject to the two-year home country physical presence requirement if the following conditions exist"". I'm not meeting any of those conditions apart from ""Specialized knowledge or skill: Skills List - The exchange visitor is a national or permanent resident of a country which has deemed the field of specialized knowledge or skill necessary to the development of the country, as shown on the Exchange Visitor Skills List"". So my country of citizenship A has my specialization listed there. My residency country B doesn't. I absolutely don't plan to return to country A, neither after my internship and neither a year after that. I'm okay with (and kinda planning on) staying in country B two years after the internship.

So, am I fucked? Also, does anything happen apart from not being able to get another US visa allowing work?
What happens if I get permanent residency in country B? What if I get citizenship from country B? Would it change anything?"

I am terrible at writing and public speaking. 

The cause of these problems are due to a combination of reasons: 
&gt; * I didn't pay attention in english class since 3rd grade and I hardly ever read as a child.
&gt; * During group presentations I always managed to avoid talking.
&gt; * When it comes to writing, I sometime get my papers revised and checked by so many people, multiply times, that it doesn't become my own anymore. 
&gt; * Microsoft word spell/grammar check

Besides my sister, not too many people know I have this problem, and I am sick of it. I hate being a burden to others. I decided to change when I had my first internship. I learned to appreciate the importance of communication and I realized I can't rely on others forever. I had to carry my own weight.

I talked to a lot of people, and they all told me the same thing. I have to read and write more. Read what I write out loud and correct what does not sound right. Read out loud what other have written and make notes. I found a couple of books on writing and is currently reading them. These books are:

&gt; * The Little Red Writing Book by Brandon Royal
&gt; * Keys to Great Writing by Stephen Wilbers
&gt; * The Book on Writing by Paula LaRocque
&gt; * The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr. and others.

However, I cannot find a lot of books to help me with Descriptive/Eloquent Writing. I came to realize maybe I couldn't find anything on these two because they're both *writing styles*. Also in part because I lack a strong set of vocabulary and writing fundamentals. 

A friend of mine suggest I read books such as:
&gt; * One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez 

Do you guys have any suggestion on other books, websites, or video to help me with descriptive and eloquent writing? Or just writing in general? Anything to help me improve my grammar and vocabulary would even do.

P.S. I hate **super** depressing stories. I like stories that end in a positive note or light. I don't mind nonfictional stories or **interesting** technical or factual books. Most of the time I enjoy them. Like..

This has me thinking back on my life as a whole, which was not very enjoyable overall. I dedicated a lot of time to school, but also never really let myself enjoy life either. High school I played video games all day, college was more of the same until I found myself socially, but by then I had already lost most of my friends. My social circle is small (essentially non existent) and my college experience was marked by excessive amounts of homework and studying.

I know that the CS degree will pay off. I know that it's a hot industry right now, and I think I have a great grasp on software development (two years of internship experience too). But my motivation is shot. My GPA has always been bad, and is dropping even further. I wake up every day, dreading what's to come. I don't have anything to look forward to, and I have no one I can lean on during the tough times.

Long time lurker here. I am an undergraduate math/econ major trying to find something to do next summer.

I've taken many applied math classes and have very strong programming skills and a lot of programming experience on my resume. I've also taken a few proof-based math and econ classes, but I tend to prefer applied computational classes.

Since the first year I have been hanging around almost excusively with two guys, let's call them Eric and John, and a girl, let's name her Elizabeth. My first year went like a charm, I had good grades and successfully passed my exames and got to chose an international exchange program for one year, in the same city as Eric. When we got there, we made a co-rental together along with 3 other people. Once again, the year flew by and we had a lot of fun. Before we came back, John asked me if I wanted to make a co-rental with him during our final year, and I accepted, because I wanted, you know, to get some intimacy from my parents.

At the end of the year, when we got back from our exchange, I managed to get an internship for 4 months in a great banking group human resources dept in Paris. It was boring but I had my time and came back later for the beginning of my final year of studies.

Since then, everything went bad. Ok so John and Eric teamed with two other good friends of mine to offer me an X-Box Slim for my b-day. I was so amazed that I didn't know what to say except that I was really thankfull. A couple of weeks later, I was playing with some friend untill 4 am, and we ended up doing some noise, but we shut it quickly.

Fast forward to Christmas, we organized a diner with like 10 people, and John and Eric were busy all day long preparing some food. We talked about it, and I told them I really wanted to do something as well, and they put me in charge of cheeses. I was totally in a rush and went to a very expensive shop to get some very good stuff. Unfortunately, I made it almost too clear during the diner, and the two guys tool it as an offense to them, like their diner was shit because I bought 80€ of dairy products for diner and bragged about it.

Anyway, the following morning, I locked myself in my bathroom, with phone, without anything to go out, and John being out for at least 4 days. The only way I had to get out was to kick the door until a hole allow me to reach the handle. As an attempt to make fun of my condition, I made a facebook status that was not entirelly explicit about it. But John took it as an insult for himself.

Fast forward after new years eve, I called john's parents who are the landlord to tell them that I will pay everything for the door, that's the least I can do about it. They come, someday in the morning at like 11am, and John's father starts to measure the thing. Apparently, he was pretty shocked that in stead of saluting him, I didn't come to offer my help.

Time goes by and the relation between John and Eric, that I consider(ed) as my best friends quickly goes really rotten, like they're ignoring me, and shit. One day, after classes, I go and see them and ask what's wrong, and they proceed to tell me everything I wrote before. The only thing I found useful to say is that I am sorry, and that I am a clumsy person, and that I didn't do this to treat them like shit, that they should tell me when I act inapropriately because I sometimes can't figure it out on my own, and sometimes, that what friends do. They tell me they are disappointed by my behaviour, but somehow glad that I came to talk about this and make things clear.

The following day, everything seems alright, both of them are normal with me, but the day after it comes worse than ever before.

I talk about it with Elizabeth, which the only one who doesn't want to take side for anybody, and she tells me that Eric is really jealous about all the opportunities I have/had in my life, and the fact that money is not an issue for me. She also tells me that Eric always had feeling for her, and that he told her about it a couple of days ago, and also the fact that he has been bitching about me for the last 3/4 weeks

Now we've always been flirting, and friday was the day we made out. I know it's not going to make to situation any better, but I don't care anymore. Yesterday, Eric came at the appartement and had diner with John before going to a party. While they were eating, I was playing onlive with some friends, and the two guys were talking normally, and all of a sudden, Eric starts muttering so I can't hear what he says.

I mean, I know I am not a manipulative person, I know I'm not really intelligent, but I don't want to do my friends some harm. But one thing I hate, is being made a total idiot, and that's what is happening right now.

Now, I'm hesitating between renting my room untilearly April, the end of my scholar year, or break the lease and go by to my parents house, and break every contact with Eric and John.

**tl;dr**: The last three years of my life are like The Young and the Restless."

Just know I am not a science geek or research savvy Biology student looking for something to add to my resume. I am an anthropology major planning on doing pre-med in a post-bac program after graduating, so I at times feel very disconnected from the pre-med society at my school. It has been my dream to be a medical doctor and help people since I was in junior high, but I need to know whether or not I am capable of doing that first.
 
So does anyone happen to have any suggestions on this and what I should do? I am really interested in working abroad, but like I said, any help or suggestions are much appreciated.
Thank you very much."
f35lp,1,2011-01-16,"I'm a pure mathematics major who is considering going into finance (investment banking and beyond). How should I ""prepare""?",[deleted],math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/f35lp/im_a_pure_mathematics_major_who_is_considering/,"I'm a third year undergraduate. For technical reasons (transferred schools, etc.), I'll probably spend five years as an undergraduate. I go to a top school (though it's not Harvard or MIT).

So far my focus has been on pure mathematics with the intention of going on to get a PhD in mathematics from a top graduate school. I'd say in my own estimation that I'm right on track for that.

I'm considering switching paths and pursuing a career in finance instead. I haven't made up my mind of course, but as part of the decision process I'd like to see exactly what I would need to do the next two years to prepare myself for such a career path as opposed to a mathematics PhD.

I've been told a summer internship at, say, Goldman Sachs or a similar bank is crucial. It's unlikely I'd be able to get such an internship this summer; instead I'll probably do another mathematics REU (though I've entertained the idea of doing some volunteer work out in the world somewhere instead). So what should I do over the next year, say, to aim for such an internship?

I've been told that it's almost essential to go to Harvard, etc., to get a job at a top investment bank. Since I don't go to Harvard, I wonder if I'm screwed.

Something else I've considered is applying for the HBS 2+2 program, which seems, honestly, pretty much targeted with me in mind. This would entail two years of work after graduating, then two years at Harvard Business School. But I'm sure competition for this program is ridiculously fierce, so I can't count on that.

Any ideas? My courseload so far has been lots of very abstract mathematics courses (lots of advanced algebraic topology, number theory, commutative/homological algebra, etc.)--stuff that's gorgeous but not useful for finance.  "

Resume critiques welcome!,[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/f32hf/looking_for_a_computer_science_internship_in_the/,"Link: https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B3NrrA6KqG87NzhmZjIzYmMtMzk3OS00Y2E5LWI4ODktMDI2NDk0MGU3MmUw&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CK2X2cAN

Background: Undergrad in my senior year and looking to do an internship in the summer. I only have time for an internship as I will be getting my officer's commission and don't know when I enter active duty after graduation. It could be anywhere from several days to several months upon commissioning that I enter active duty, so I'm looking for internships just to be safe and to get additional private-sector experience. The specific field I would like to get into is network security, but software engineering experience in general works too.

Some related questions/concerns:

* The header looks extremely generic. Should I ""pretty it up"" or leave it as is? Any ideas for templates for the header that look nice and professional?

* My cumulative GPA is crap (2.77). I admit I screwed up a lot during my first two years, but I've made significant progress, especially my last 3 semesters which averaged 3.1. Is there any way I can minimize how bad my CGPA looks during the initial application or interview? Maybe by explaining my progress?

* I would like to mention the specific programming projects I've done but don't know if it's absolutely necessary since I am already exceeding one page in length. 

*Putting my LinkedIn profile URL on my resume: Y/N?

Thanks!"
f32e5,5,2011-01-15,"What do employers mean when they list ""proficiency in SAS"" as a job requirement?",BirthDeath,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/f32e5/what_do_employers_mean_when_they_list_proficiency/,"I am a statistics graduate student and am applying for summer internships, many of which require proficiency in SAS.  

This strikes me as a bit strange since my department almost exclusively uses R or (for computationally intensive tasks) lower level languages like FORTRAN or C.  

I had a license for SAS from when I worked on an empirical project in a different department and I used it extensively to create libraries to clean data and extract relevant variables.  I typically would then convert the data set to *.csv format and read it into R.  I rarely performed any extensive analysis within SAS; I found the interface to be a bit clunky.

Now, since my license expired, I do just about everything in R and my SAS skills have gotten a bit rusty.  I am a bit worried that my interviewers will ask me how to perform specific operations within SAS that I will not be able to answer.  

I can access SAS from my school's network, so I was going to try to brush up on it over the next few weeks.   Is there anything specific reference that I should go over, preferably a reference for people familiar with R who are converting to SAS (I know that the reverse is much more common)?

Finally, what is the role of SAS in the private sector (insurance/finance)?  Do they just use it to clean large data sets or do they use it to perform all of their analysis?

f431u,0,2011-01-17,A high school student with issues,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f431u/a_high_school_student_with_issues/,"I'm a high school senior and I think I have serious issues. I dread being at home. Here's how my typical day goes.. I leave home around 7 in the morning for school and get out of class at 3 in the afternoon. Afterwards, I have an internship at my school and I usually stay there rather than go home. Why? When I'm there, I'm surrounded by friends, people who share common interests with me (technology). When I'm there, I feel stress free. When I'm at home, I have a mother who only opens her mouth to scold me. Whenever I ask her for advice, she scolds me, then asks me to go as my father. I never talk to my father as he is extremely irrational. If I were to ask him for advice, he will usually shift the subject to something along the lines of how I'm a failure, I'm not going to succeed, and just completely rape my mind. I have deeper issues with my brother which I will not get into, and the only person remaining who I don't have issues with is my sister. I can relate with her and can be open with her. I think she shares the same feeling about being at home as me. Aside from these family issues, I'm often in a foul mood. I feel lethargic in class and often unenthusiastic which shouldn't be the case for a person my age. Thoughts, criticism? I have a feeling I'm going to get flamed for this post but I really felt the need to get this off my chest."

We did it at a summer party, she wanted to do it again afterwards but I turned her down. She's really hot, but doesn't shave at all plus I didn't want people to find out.


Only two guys knew back then, one guy ended up fucking her after I turned her down several times. When he was confronted with it he did the ol' ""he did it first"" routine, drunk fuck. So yeah.. ask away!"
f42nq,29,2011-01-17,"IAmA Recovering Drug Addict and Here is My Story, AMA",vesperka,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f42nq/iama_recovering_drug_addict_and_here_is_my_story/,"I first started using drugs when I was 16. I didn't do anything I considered too extreme - I smoked pot and drank occasionally just like most of my other friends. I never saw anything wrong with this; I liked the way these substances made me feel and I didn't notice any devastating repercussions, so everything seemed fine from my perspective. 


While my other friends were smoking only on weekends, I had already made it a daily habit after smoking for only a month. A few months after that I had gained a reputation as being a pothead, and to be honest I was actually proud of it. I thought smoking pot made me look cool, and I was proud to have a well-known identity in my school. Before I was a pothead, I was just a nerdy, straight A student, but once I was known as a smoker I made so many new ""friends."" With my new persona, so many people would come up to me and say shit like, ""Yo I never knew you smoked, let's blaze sometime!""


A huge turning point in my life came when I was raiding a medicine cabinet in my house one day. My sister had broken her leg recently, but she didn't finish all of her Vicodin. Figuring there was virtually no chance in getting caught, I popped a few of them and immediately fell in love. Vicodin made me feel like I've never felt before. Normally I can be an anxious and timid person, but when I was on Vicodin I was on top of the world. I had no problem hitting on girls and I felt like I was the life of the party no matter where I went. 


In my mind, pills were safer than street drugs. Prescription drugs can't be harmful because they're used to treat and cure people, so how could they be bad for me? I had no problem stealing leftover prescriptions from my family. Things started to get even worse when I felt like I was in control and I knew too much for my own good. 



After trying Xanax a few times, I studied a lot on the symptoms of depression and anxiety and was able to get a 4mg/day prescription even though I definitely didn't need it. When I walked in to meet the psychiatrist, I had absolutely no problems coming up with traumatic childhood events that never happened and crying on the spot. I made up bullshit stories about how the world scared the shit out of me, how I was generally afraid of people, and how I felt like everybody else in the world was capable of connecting with people and feeling emotions that I would never be able to feel (these were all lies). Lying to people has become second nature to me. I'm an expert at manipulating people into getting what I want when it comes to this sort of thing.


As if that wasn't enough, I was able to find several sites operating out of the US that would allow you to buy schedule 4 drugs (mostly benzodiazepines), so I had a virtually unlimited supply of Xanax and Valium. 


I didn't use valium all that often because it made me too sedated, but Xanax has been great for me for a long time. Whenever I'd go to a party I'd bring my prescription bottle with me. I never drank on my own but will at parties, so when I went out it would involve me drinking straight vodka and popping xanax until I passed out. Usually I wouldn’t remember anything, but my friends would tell me I acted like a complete asshole, got trashed, and had to be babysat. I'd look at my prescription bottle the next morning and notice 20mg of Xanax gone (which is probably enough to sedate an elephant), but none of this phased me. I promised my friends I would be in more control next time, but I never was.


After graduating near the top of my class in high school, I began attending one of the top engineering schools in the US. I was heavily abusing Xanax and painkillers when I could get my hands on them. I really hated my experience at this school, but even know I don't know what to attribute this to (though my guess is drug abuse). I skipped most of my classes and opted to stay in my dorm room 24/7, and still managed to pull off straight C's. I was completely depressed and rightfully so - try sitting alone in a room all day and NOT be depressed. I eventually was able to have the psychiatrist and dean of students at the school set me up with a medical leave of absence, and I never went back to that school.


My parents insisted that I get a job if I'm not going to be a college, so I did. I knew my parents were going to suggest this and I knew I would get drug tested for a job, so I managed to stay clean for two months (this being in the only time in a span of 5 years where I could've passed a drug test). Because I was able to stop for this period of time, I didn't think for a second that I had a problem. Most people say ""I can quit whenever I want to"" but don't stop using, but I was actually able to do this for a short period of time, so I felt invincible. I landed a job as an intern in a technical department of a large company (30,000+ employees). 


After a few months of this job, I started to hate it. I hated every second of my existence for a while. Waking up early, dealing with uptight douches all day, and then being too exhausted after work to do anything. Taking a ton of Xanax helped get through the day, but I wasn't happy with my life or the direction it seemed to be going in. I felt trapped, like I was destined to work at a mind-numbing job for eternity.


Because my more successful friends were off at college now, the only friends I had left in my hometown were the druggies. I enjoyed having people my age to hang out with for once. My friends quickly introduced me to oxycontin and coke. When I first started smoking pot I swore to myself I would never use coke, so I stuck to oxycontin. In my eyes, oxycontin was equivalent to vicodin as they are both painkillers, but chemically speaking oxycontin is nearly identical to heroin. 


Needless to say, oxycontin was greater to me than anything I could imagine. I became incredibly enthusiastic at work, I never felt tired or exhausted, and I even found a girlfriend. At this point, I had completely fucked myself over. I felt like oxy made me a better person and made my life worthwhile, and this was a bad place for me to be in. I started using oxy all of the time, and for the first time in a while I started loving my life. My managers loved the work I was producing and loved my attitude. I was a fully functioning addict, and my life seemed perfect.


Then the withdrawals started. My dealer didn't have great oxy connections, so he didn't always have a supply (not to mention he charged me up the ass). When he didn't have oxy, I started using coke just so I could be high on something. Coke didn't give me the same euphoria that oxy did, but I felt happy to be alive when I was on it, so it got the job done. It wasn't long before I started snorting coke and oxy together - easily the best physical feeling I've ever felt and will probably ever feel - and I was easily spending $100+ a day on getting high. It easily got to the point where I'd wake up feeling sick every morning, but this was OK because I knew in a few seconds I'd feel great once I had a few lines in me.

Whenever I couldn't get my hands on anything, my life was horrible. It took all of the energy in the world just to get out of my bed, let alone work an 8 hour day. It was awful not being able to talk about it or get help for fear of consequences. It’s not like I could tell my boss “sorry I can’t come in today, I’m dope sick.” I can’t imagine Hell being any worse than being alive during those days, but that wouldn’t stop me from going back.

Despite being dry for even weeks at a time, the second I got a text from my dealer I would be all over it. I would drain my checkings and savings and stock up. Here I was - a 20 year old kid with absolutely no living expenses whatsoever making over $500 a week - and yet I never had over $100 in my bank account for more than a day. This didn't bother me at all though; as long as I was high I was happy and didn't have a care in the world.

It was a little less than a year after using oxy and coke that I OD'd. I've never seen so many people that I knew and loved so upset. I've never been especially close with my family. I never tell my brothers, sisters, or parents that I love them (and vice versa), and we're just not to open with each other. Seeing how much shit I put them through still makes me tear up though. My family was watching me in the ER while my body was lying lifeless. I can't even begin to imagine how awful of a sight it would be to see my son dying right in front of me with there being absolutely nothing I could do to help. I blacked out at around 5PM the day I overdosed, and didn't come to until around 8AM the next morning. It took a while for everything to sink in too. 


When I was discharged, I was pissed at my sister for throwing my drugs away, and I was pissed at my parents for monitoring all of my prescriptions and treating me like I was a baby. My parents had to essentially lock me in the house for two weeks otherwise we both know I would've gone out searching for drugs. After two weeks, I had scheduled an appointment to see a doctor about Suboxone treatment, and luckily that stuff is great at reducing cravings and preventing me from feeling sick.


It's been six months since I overdosed, I've seen so many people hurt from this, yet I haven't been completely clean. Despite every single negative incident that's occurred from drug use, I still have a desire to use. Addiction is the most confusing, fucked up beast in the world. I used to view myself as a successful, in-control person filled with potential, but now I'm at an incredibly vulnerable point in my life. Most people I know have a hard time trusting me (and if they don't, then they probably should), I've put others through so much emotional trauma, and I'm lucky to be alive right now. But even after writing about all of this damage, sometimes I struggle finding anything that will make me feel better than using oxy and coke. I've relapsed twice in the last six months or so, and even though these were small, isolated incidents, I still can't believe how I could go back to any of that.


One psychologist has really helped me open my eyes on this issue. When discussing painkillers he said this, ""Painkillers don't kill pain. You can't just target pain and kill it. Painkillers separate you so far from your body that nothing else matters."" I feel like I've wasted a very long time separating myself from reality. I used to be able to control my emotions and be artificially happy, but there's no reward in this. When I'm clean, I know I'm capable of experiencing a wider spectrum of emotions, both high and low. 


Dealing with the low is such a foreign experience to me. I have no way to cope with this. I used to think about suicide a lot after I overdosed and dedicated myself to getting clean, but these moments are becoming less frequent. Likewise, I still get cravings when I reminisce about the highs I used to get, but I realize my memory is very selective and forgets to remember the lows. I've gone days without moving or eating and I've broken down in tears countless times when I look back at how much I've screwed up and how much pain drugs have caused me, yet I still wish I could get high at least several times a day.


Addiction is the most illogical force in the universe, and I'm doing whatever I can to fight it. I'm taking the next semester off from school and going to a rehab clinic, so that's a start, but not a finish. I'm trying to find true happiness in every day activities, but it's impossible to forget the artificial happiness I know I can always get. All I can do now is remember my past and try to become a better person because of this.


I'm still in the early stages of recovery. Feel free to ask any questions no matter how offensive or insensitive they might be. Addiction is a hard thing for anybody to understand, and all I can do is offer my perspective. If nothing else, writing this has been therapeutic for me – anybody can benefit from a little introspection.

I've relapsed twice in the last six months or so, and even though these were small, isolated incidents, I still can't believe how I could go back to any of that.

One psychologist has really helped me open my eyes on this issue. When discussing painkillers he said this, ""Painkillers don't kill pain. You can't just target pain and kill it. Painkillers separate you so far from your body that nothing else matters."" I feel like I've wasted a very long time separating myself from reality. I used to be able to control my emotions and be artificially happy, but there's no reward in this. When I'm clean, I know I'm capable of experiencing a wider spectrum of emotions, both high and low. 

Dealing with the low is such a foreign experience to me. I have no way to cope with this. I used to think about suicide a lot after I overdosed and dedicated myself to getting clean, but these moments are becoming less frequent. Likewise, I still get cravings when I reminisce about the highs I used to get, but I realize my memory is very selective and forgets to remember the lows. I've gone days without moving or eating and I've broken down in tears countless times when I look back at how much I've screwed up and how much pain drugs have caused me, yet I still wish I could get high at least several times a day.

Addiction is the most illogical force in the universe, and I'm doing whatever I can to fight it. I'm taking the next semester off from school and going to a rehab clinic, so that's a start, but not a finish. I'm trying to find true happiness in every day activities, but it's impossible to forget the artificial happiness I know I can always get. All I can do now is remember my past and try to become a better person because of this.

I'm still in the early stages of recovery. Feel free to ask any questions no matter how offensive or insensitive they might be. Addiction is a hard thing for anybody to understand, and all I can do is offer my perspective. If nothing else, writing this has been therapeutic for me – anybody can benefit from a little introspection.

f3w9w,2,2011-01-17,I can't get over her. Finding someone else as good as her seems impossible,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/f3w9w/i_cant_get_over_her_finding_someone_else_as_good/,"So I dated a girl for six months. We're both 23 years old, she was freshly graduated from college, I still have a year left. We started off as friends, (she was dating someone else at the time) but a little over a month after she broke it off with him, we started going out.  Everything was FANTASTIC. We had tons of fun together, even when we were just sitting at home doing nothing. The sex was amazing (she would have 6+ O's per session). She was level headed, kind, caring, didn't pull any dramatic bullshit. We literally never fought, not once. Although I never told anyone until after we split up, I genuinely thought we would get married.

We dated for about a month in San Antonio, then she moved back home to Houston after she graduated. I found an internship in Houston that was worth coming for regardless of relationships, and I started looking at apartments and getting ready to move. Then about two months before I move to Houston she breaks it off. My internship is with the American Le Mans Series team Risi Competizione, and for someone who wants to work in racing, this is a huge opportunity. So I still moved here to Houston, even though we broke up.

When she broke it off she said she didn't know why she felt different now, and I believe her. Emotions don't always have a clear cause, I can understand that. It was just such a shock to have all my little day-dream fantasy future ideas yanked out from under me, with no warning, only two months before we could be together every day if we wanted. I think we kind of got stuck in the new-relationship-zone because of the distance. Every time we would visit each other it was like starting the relationship over in a tiny way, and right when we're feeling super comfortable again, one of us has to leave.

So anyway, I was head over heels in love with her, and I know she loved me too. Now I can't get over her. People always say ""think of the times when things weren't so good."" I can honestly say there weren't any. They also say ""date other people"" or ""sleep with someone else."" Done both, didn't help.

I don't believe in "" the one"", just one person for everyone. But I do believe that finding another person as great as she was is going to be really fucking hard. She was funny, she could speak spanish, she was easy going, she was amazing in bed, she was cute beyond belief, she was competitive (like me), she was giving, she was more than I could ever have asked for. Hell, she liked to give ME a massage before sex because it turned her on. How awesome is that?!

I just don't know what to do. I know that part of my longing for her is caused by my fear of being alone, of going through one shitty relationship after another trying to find someone who makes me as happy as she did. I know I'm a great catch. I'm smart, funny, driven, I'd like to think I'm attractive, and there's a very good chance I'll be a millionaire by the time I'm 26 (Oil found on family ranch). It's not finding someone else I'm afraid of, it's finding someone as good as her. I know there are plenty of fish in the sea, but not all the fish are equal."

I was wondering if any scientists/people in science based jobs could give me some advice. I'm pretty sure I want to get out of Britain, even for just a little bit.

Here are my options/interests:  
* Diving - Looking to complete my HSE SCUBA in a few months.  
* Communicating science - Would most likely have to be marine science, considering my background. I really like the idea of engaging the public on science issues.  
* Fisheries management - To a certain extent, though my interest in this has been recently overtaken by the other two above.

I was considering taking a year out, but I'm worried about falling behind on current science. I was hoping to hop between a few countries, working as an intern, to keep my knowledge up. I'm not sure how easy this would be however, with visa restrictions and the like.

Also, a lot of communication courses require a portfolio of work. Although I'm passionate about this topic, and considered starting a science blog or something, the workload of my final year has prevented it. I do regularly find myself debating science issues with people, but it hardly counts as 'past experience.' 

If I was travelling, I would find writing easy I think. This too applies if I got a consultancy position and worked for a year in one location. 

My question is basically: How easy is it to work/study abroad? And would a year out, even if I focused on getting experience, cause me problems with finding work/study later on?

f3kru,139,2011-01-16,My first encounter with the police: Did I do the right thing?,tehpolice,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/f3kru/my_first_encounter_with_the_police_did_i_do_the/,"Throwaway for whatever reason. By way of background I am a law student and an intern at a criminal defense firm. I have never had any experience with the police aside from a speeding ticket years ago. Prior to this incident I would be the first to side with the police, saying that most of the time they are just doing their job (irony, with me working for a defense firm but I digress.) This incident changed me. 

Last night at about 11 p.m. my girlfriend and I were having sex. Mid-coitus, we hear someone pounding at the door. I left my room (naked) and asked who it was through the door. I hear, “police, open the door right now!” I said I’m coming I’ll just be a minute and frantically searched for clothes to put on. They kept screaming to open the door immediately and continued to pound away. I was so frazzled it took me twice as long to get dressed, and although it felt like an eternity, it probably only took a minute or so. I finally crack open the door, and am greeted to 3 officers screaming at me to open the door fully. One was shining a flashlight in my face, and the other jammed her foot in the door way so I could not shut the door. I tried to remain as calm as possible, and asked what this was all about. They said someone called the police and said a woman was screaming for help inside my apartment. They asked me if I was alone, and I said no, my girlfriend is with me. By this time she had gotten dressed and came to the door to say hello. They were being very accusatory, asking me why I wouldn’t open the door fully and what was I hiding etc. I said I had nothing to hide but just that I respect my privacy. 

This is where things started getting scary. They asked if they could search my apartment. I said no. This refusal flipped a switch in all three of them. They started accusing me of doing illegal things in my apartment and that if I had nothing to hide, I should just let them search. We were doing nothing illegal at all, and I have no contraband in my apartment, but the way they were accusing and threatening me scared me to the point that I thought a search was crossing the line. I continued to refuse, saying that I know my Constitutional rights (I mentioned I was a law student.) That if they wanted to search they would need a warrant or exigent circumstances. I said that a neighbor’s phone call is not enough to give them justification to search my apartment, especially when both my girlfriend and I appeared at the door, and answered their initial questions. They became even more hostile, crowding around my door and raising their voices while expanding their chests. They said they wanted our IDs, and ordered me to go get them. I said no. I said we have done nothing wrong and I don’t want my name on some report for doing nothing except being in my home. At this point the woman became very angry. She said something like how about I drag your ass down to the station and take your fingerprints? 

So, I asked her if I was under arrest. They started backpedaling and wouldn’t answer that question. They were saying I wouldn’t give them our IDs because we must be criminals and we must be hiding something. I said of course not. Neither of us have any criminal history whatsoever. I got a speeding maybe 5 years ago. One of the officers started reading something from the law that says we need to cooperate or something. I said we have, but that I’m not letting them just search my home. At some point I said something about Fourth Amendment, and paraphrased it. They asked me to go get it (I said I have a copy). It was clear they wanted me to move away from the door so they could swing it open. So I said I’d be happy to get it if the officer would please remove her foot from the door way, I’d close the door, get the Constitution and return. She would not move her foot so I stayed at the door. 

At some point I turned my head away (looking back inside) and all three of them grabbed my arm and started pulling me out the front door. I physically could not have been pulled out because the door was shutting on me and I was wedged in the doorway. My girlfriend started screaming and I told her start recording this on her phone (she didn’t, it happened too fast). They kept pulling on my arm, and then pushed the door in and stormed into my apartment.  The two male officers stood on either side of me while the female searched my apartment. Of course she found nothing. At this point I was yelling in disbelief saying I thought we were living in America. One of the officers was screaming back at me, I thought it was going to escalate. In the scuffle through the front door, they pushed my girlfriend, and I had scratches and blood blisters on my arms from three people pulling on me. My back has about a 6” wide patch of skin scraped off from being wedged in the door as they were trying to pull me out front. Once they did the search they left in a hurry. I said I wanted all their names and badge numbers. She wrote them down and they left quickly without saying another word. The entire incident took probably ten minutes, and they left in about 30 seconds after searching my apartment. I was shocked, and am still a little shaken up about it. 

Today, I was thinking should I have just given them our IDs and let them search my home? If I had, it would have never gone this far and the entire encounter would have taken 30 seconds. But the way they were screaming at me from the beginning and the way they were acting was as if I’d murdered someone. Plus, they interrupted some fantastic sex. In all, as a law student it was a very eye opening experience. I’m not sure if it was the right thing to do, because things could have gotten out of hand quickly. But on the other hand I just spent an entire semester studying the Fourth Amendment and I don’t want strangers in my home due to an anonymous, and completely bogus, phone call from the neighbor. Doesn’t the Constitution mean anything anymore?

I'd meant to upgrade about a year ago, but then the recession happened, and  like a lot of people, suddenly upgrading a damaged but workable computer wasn't at the top of my priorities. 

After about 2 years of graduate school and using a computer that would randomly shut off I decided to upgrade. To put my financial situation in context am a semester away from finishing my Masters degree in International Economics and just landed a really great internship with a really great think tank. In essence, I have a really great opportunity to make some money in the near future, but right now I am not exactly flush with cash. I took the money that I saved this summer and others that I got from Christmas and bought a new Macbook. I figured, I will be making my living writing, so I might as well have something that works.

Flashcut to last Thursday, my computer is covered in wine and my $1000 investment in myself is now a $1000 doorstop. Even now I'm not sure how it happened. I wasn't drunk and I wasn't acting stupid, the glass just fell. It was the definition of an accident. The next day I had to head back to New Jersey to finish up some work at an academic journal that I edit, so my girlfriend took the broken computer to the Apple Store to plead with them. Her pleas fell on deaf ears. I guess the original guy was very condescending and simply said I was screwed because even though I had Apple Care, spills aren't covered. She made an appointment with the Genius Bar just to see what they had to say.

Today I took it to the Genius Bar and John was my savior. The computer was broke, it was my fault and Apple legally had no responsibility. I explained my situation to John, what happened, and he decided to pull some strings, bend some rules and managed to swap out my old wine soaked computer, for a new one.

f4pbq,2,2011-01-18,What is it with this job?,boneseh,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f4pbq/what_is_it_with_this_job/,"Everyday I hate this job more and more and was wondering what you guys thought about this situation:

I'm a master's level grad student living at home so I don't accrue as much debt as I would renting a place near campus.  I was jobless for the most part, I did some basic websites for people I ran into that wanted websites or needed their current ones updated; it gave me a little something extra to do with my time and I enjoyed it.  A few weeks into the semester a neighbor offers me a job to help them catch up on work, 10 hours a week, nothing much.  I figured what the hell; why not help the guy out, so I took the job.  I was filing and doing data entry, but within that first week I was already allowed to work as much as I wanted.  I worked close to full-time, ranging from 30-40 hours a week getting paid $10/hour.  I was being taught every single job at the business - it was a small shop, 20 employees at most.  My neighbor is the #2 guy and I had heard the owner is useless, sucks the company dry, and yells at people for no good reason.  He hadn't yelled at me and things were still going great so I was happy (with the exception of wanting to make more money, but I was doing work a monkey could do so I felt the pay was fair).

My neighbor knew I made websites so he talked with me about working on some websites for clients: I would get a slight pay raise to $15/hour when I was doing web design work.  I said sure since it beat filing and data entry and the next thing I knew I was in a meeting with the web guy, my neighbor, and the owner.  The web guy told them it would take anywhere from 2-3 months to get these sites done, so I was thrilled to have that kind of work for that amount of time.  As it turns out, these weren't sites for just ordinary small business clients; these were sites for...Coke's biggest rival - 12 of their brands. (Before you start thinking I worked on #1rival.com, these were sites for the brands to sell their merchandise through so the brand would always be the same regardless of what the brand was printed on.)  Well, I ended up knocking these sites out in 2 weeks - 2 months ahead of the projected deadline!  Needless to say, they were impressed, error checked the sites, and told me I did a tremendous job.

Next on my list is a smaller organization's website and this is where the shit hit the fan.  The owner comes up and sees me planning the website and goes off on me.  He said that just because people want websites doesn't mean they get one - even though this organization had already paid.  It didn't matter that I was instructed to work on this site, I was the person on his shitlist that day and he basically told me I did a ""tremendous"" job on the 12 sites, but now I am reduced to filing and data entry, no more art requests, no more website work.

Fine, fuck this guy, I was doing websites for $15/hour, that's his loss.  Welllll, now it seems as if that was the first knock against me.  Recently I had a complaint filed against me for talking too much to the web guy I helped.  First of all, I'm introverted and do not talk much at work, I'm either asking a question or answering a question. Second, I got pulled from doing the web work and haven't even been around the web guy in a month! (He's upstairs, I do the filing and data entry downstairs.)  The only reason the complaint was submitted was because the web guy's productivity had dropped since I came aboard, so it must be my fault.

Next thing I hear they're bringing in a new employee.  She is going to work part-time, less hours than me, and she gets the new computer I was supposed to be receiving.  Then she receives my desk + chair so I now get to stand or sit on the floor. This is her second week and they're already taking my hours and giving them to her even though she has been late and not reported to work some days because her other job made her work.  WTF!?  Is this the type of employee they want?  To me this is bullshit and seems as if they're trying to make me quit.

I hate this job more and more each day and would quit if it wasn't for the money.  I originally started grad school with the laissez-faire attitude of being able to pay my student loans back when I get a job, but now my mindset has shifted to not wanting to graduate with loans.  At the rate I was going I was able to work off the loans I accrued each semester with not much to spare.  I didn’t want to quit this job because they were flexible with my hours.  If I wanted, I was able to just take the day which was nice because I had planned on having an unpaid internship and I’d have to lessen my hours at this place so I could work at the internship place which would give me good experience and benefit me in my career.  I did not let them know about this since the internship hadn’t been set in stone and now it’s a good thing I didn’t because the guy I was going to work with is now transferring to a different place of business and I can’t follow him to that location and he was my in at the last place.

I’m thinking I should quit, but then I lose the income and I also feel as if I quit now I’ll quit the next time things get uncomfortable and I don’t want to be viewed as a quitter (many of the people at this organization live in my neighborhood and know me on a personal basis).  At the same time I’m thinking they’re trying to make me quit by just making my job suck and in that case I would rather continue working there just to shove it in there face.  In a third light, I think this could be a result of my introvertedness and letting other things pop-up and me saying “OK that’s fine” since I wouldn’t make things difficult and was easygoing.

I don’t know…what do you think reddit?

TL;DR: My job went from great to awful.  Boss told me I did a tremendous job then demoted me. I got a complaint for talking too much filed on me a week ago for a guy I haven't talked to in a month and I'm introverted and don't say much unless I am asking or answering a question.  The main reason I got the complaint filed on me is that the person I was ""talking"" to has had a decrease in productivity.  They hired a new employee who works fewer hours than me, does not show up on time and sometimes doesn't show up at all - yet she got my new computer, desk, chair, and they're now giving her my hours.  Are they trying to make me quit or what?  What do I do?"

f4k27,0,2011-01-18,How can I develop myself to become a better person( please help?) ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f4k27/how_can_i_develop_myself_to_become_a_better/,"I have been having some trouble in college for the past few years. I used to do computing sciences, and have recently switched ( after failing one year and retaking it) degrees to a degree in Economics.  I have learned HTML and some PHP, that's all I have taken away from 2 years of college doing that degree. I used to have a passion for computing sciences ( and still do) it was because I failed one single class that I just couldn't get past, that I can't go that route of where my passions lie. 

It's not going as bad as it was last year. I am sort of comfortable with things now. However, I fear that if I don't find an internship relating to my current degree, that I will most definitely NOT have a job.  And that's if I graduate, and I emphasise if. 

Now whenever I'm searching for jobs, I find that the demand is either in Web development or something else of the same nature. But no company wants to hire someone like me, despite the novice skills that I have developed in these areas. 
And I am also not confident that I can do these things, even if a degree was not necessary in said vacancy.

That doesn't matter. So I go look for internships, and they only take the top tier students. This shouldn't be a problem either, had it not been for the fact that my previous degree has put down my GPA, somewhat horribly.  And that no matter what I do now, it wouldn't help. 

 I'm still finding it hard to cope with things.
Watching all of my friends graduate, watching them get jobs already. While I'm here, still doing the same thing, and barely holding on. 
It's almost as if I want to quite college already, because it's stressing me out so much, that I haven't slept in the past few weeks. I just don't know what I will do if I fail this year. And it scares the living hell out of me. I can't sleep, suicide even crossed my mind a couple of times.

So what I am saying here is,

I am 21 years old, and I feel like I just don't have any skills. 
Are there places that deal with people like me, in the event that they fail university?   And is it really that bad? 

I just find it that the chance that I make it this year is slim, and the before mentioned fact of all of everyone I know already graduating, is taking its toll on me. 

 I would love a position where I learn something, while working. I value these, even above the degree I'm studying for. I just want some experience. But these sort of positions just don't appear to exist even. 



*Degree names have been renamed to a more ambiguous definition, to protect my identity. I have friends on this website, and I don't want them to know about this.

So Reddit, what do I do? What can I do?

Do I keep going. Try my best despite the feeling that I won't graduate or even pass this year, and hope that I can stand the mental strain that comes with this?
 
Or do I already start working on a contingency plan. And if so, how can a non-university level student get a reasonable entry level starting career?


Sorry for this post, I don't really usually do this.

f4ivi,1,2011-01-18,Should I take the job?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f4ivi/should_i_take_the_job/,"Ok reddit, I'll try and keep this short.....I just graduated from graduate school with a master's degree in elementary education specializing in science/technology education from a top 15 program. During fall semester I was required to complete a full time internship. 

Over the last couple of years I realized that I enjoy teaching middle school more than elementary so I fought to get into a local middle school that has an incredibly high percentage of at-risk, low-performing students (about 95% receive free/reduced priced breakfast and lunch). I excelled beyond my wildest dreams and so did my students. I became a teacher leader in the school and wasn't even a paid employee, it was a dream come true. I had visions and plans of staying after graduation, substituting, while waiting for a position to open. Then it happened...

The last week of my internship I was sexually harassed by my principal....Some background there....it is *very* common for the administrators, teachers, and school personnel to go and have a drink or two after work on Fridays. Everybody needs to cut loose once in a while. I have gone before and stayed for a drink so going out for a drink this time seemed completely harmless. After a bit I noticed that my administrators were on a mission...the principal was drinking straight bourbon and the vice principal was all over the place drinking rum, gin, long island ice teas, you name it. 

After the principal has had a few he grabs my ass and says to me, ""You have no idea how great of a body you have do you?"" and proceeds to ask me to go to his car to, ""kiss and hug him""....WTF???? I tell him very sternly that that was highly inappropriate and I am leaving...before I left he managed to slip in another comment about how I should get a tongue piercing...creep.

I left and was *really* upset. This man was a role model for me, I looked at him kind of like a grandfather figure (he's in his 60's easily, I'm 24) and the fact that he had the audacity to so blatantly hit on me literally made me sick to my stomach. I went home and slept on it...I cried that night. I felt violated. 

I talked to my university (they were LIVID) and my friends for advice. I decided that I would never get drinks with them again (duh) and that since it was an isolated incident and he was clearly under the influence I would brush it off as a onetime mishap.

About 2-3 weeks later, it was my birthday and I was bringing cake up to the front office (note: *always* get the front office people and janitors on your side) and ended up speaking with the lady in charge of booking substitutes. I told her that I was getting my tonsils out over break and would start in the middle of January. Little did I know, but my principal was standing behind me and as I mentioned my surgery he said, ""Now you'll be able to go deeper."" I ALMOST DIED! Seriously, WTF, he said this in front of someone, DURING school hours. This guy has some MAJOR balls. I didn't even know how to respond, I literally just turned and walked away, not saying a word.

I didn't go back to the school after that. I couldn't bring myself to do it and it eats me alive because I love those kids so much and don't want to leave them....Today I received a phone call from the school saying there is a full time opening and they want me to have it (legally they have to interview others but it's mine for the taking) and I don't know what to do. It is my dream career and it is tainted by some pervy old man. 

So, reddit, my question for you is: *what do I do*? I should also mention that I need a letter of recommendation from this man but I haven't seen him to ask...

Sorry it's so long! :)

Oh, and I'm driving for about 3 hrs today so I might not be able to answer for a little. Thank you so much in advance!"

Unfortunately, I know next to nothing about non-academic careers in neuro. I'm considering medical science or drug development, which obviously require more education and experience than I have. I would appreciate any insider info someone might have about such a career (or any other job/career that may involve neuro).

I graduated university early and spent my third year abroad studying a different subject so I have no lab experience. Ideally I'd like to get a post-grad internship, but I have no idea how to go about getting one. (I'm having trouble sifting out the scams in my googling).

This girl has been my roommate (we live in dorms at school together) for a year and a half now. We're both in our early 20s. 

- She has a steady boyfriend of 2 and a half years, who lives on the same floor as us.
- They like to make me uncomfortable when they're together and I'm in the room
- They like to try and make me leave the room so they can be alone

Sounds somewhat normal, right? I mean, girl has a boyfriend, wants roommate to leave... sexiled....

...no. It's not like that at all. 

When they're in here together, its all cutesy noises. Like a kitten or a baby cooing. For very long amounts of time. Maybe she's changing her clothes (under a blanket) and her bf makes ""ooooo.... aaaaaah...."" noises, like someone admiring a pretty painting in a museum. They talk cutesy baby talk all the time they're in the room together. It's even creepier when they're playing under the bed or something... cuz all I hear is cutesy noises.

So maybe you're like ""Oh, thats just when you're in there..."". Well, I've walked in on them too. When they totally don't expect it. He might be brushing her hair, and they'll be making cutesy noises. Or maybe they're playing paddy-cake.

Every night before bed, he comes in, and they talk in baby noises... Maybe he gives her a bedtime story? I can't really tell. But he'll kneel by her bed and talk gently for a little while, and she'll make baby coo noises... then he'll turn off the lights (regardless if I'm in here (studying/homework/playing games) or not) and leave. I mean, I guess every now and then to have your boyfriend come in for a long goodnight can be sweet, but every night?

In general, she has 3 modes. (1) Motherly to younger members of floor (2) OMG I'm a five year old (3) I need to go to work / study. #2 is the most common. She'll be playful with people, make pouty faces of ""Why won't you play with me?"" In that five year old tone. Try and get piggy back rides from guys on floor (she's rather tall... I feel sorry for the guy sometimes). Hold hands, swinging, skipping down the hallway, with just about any guy, maybe singing a song... She'll make ""cute"" cards that look like a five year old made them out of crayons and construction paper... Watch the tv shows and movies that we all watched when we were toddlers... 

Sidenote, she's on an internship right now, and I'm still in classes, and it happens to be my semester with the most work yet... so she goes to bed early, while I'll be in here studying pretty much all the time.. and complains to everyone how I'm always in the room and never give her and her boyfriend privacy... I have a boyfriend too, and occasionally do homework at his place, because I realize we do share the room and she'd probably like some alone time sometimes.. I do this mainly on weekends and maybe once or twice during the week... I mean, we share the room... 

TwoX, what do I do? Most people just say ""Um.. that's sick..."" and don't give me any advice... How do I deal with this? I'm starting to get fed up with the cute. It's driving me mad, and sometimes its just disturbing. Am I alone with having ever had to deal with this? How would you all confront this?

tl;dr: My roommate and her boyfriend are disturbingly, sickly cutesy together. How do I deal with this?"

I guess I should introduce myself. Well, I'm 19 years old, I turn 20 next month tho, I currently go to a community college pursuing a double major in Networking Technology and Information Systems Security, I like to play video games and guitar(if you couldnt tell from my username :P). If you wanna know anything else, just message me, I dont wanna drag this out.

Ok so, my issue here is that I'm really not sure what I'm going to do after college.  I currently work at Walmart in the electronics department, I have a 3.8 GPA and only 1 more year of college. Oh and I currently live at home, I have around $6,000 saved up because all I have to pay is my cell phone bill, credit card and gas money. I dont have to worry about loans or anything because I received scholarships that payed for my first 2 years, plus community college is pretty cheap anyways. Right now I'm trying to find another job or internship so I can get some IT job experience so finding a full time job will be a little bit easier when I get out of school.  I'm currently working on getting my CCNA certification, I've finished all of the classes, just need to study up a bit. I'm really not sure what would be the best route to go after school. My current plan is to try to find a job(obviously).  But if I have trouble finding one, I plan on joining the Air Force/Army to do something in one of their IT fields for job experience, or go on to a 4 year university to major in something else IT related, such as Software Information Systems and go from there. I feel that I'm more on track as opposed to most of my friends, who have no idea or any plans for when they get out of college.  I've tried to tell them that having a 4 year degree doesn't guarantee you ANYTHING, but it's like arguing with a brick wall, lol.

I have some comfort knowing that at least I have a couple of plans to fall back on.  But I just can't shake the feeling that I'm going to be lost after I'm out of school.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, any comments/suggestions are appreciated.

**TL;DR** - Currently at a community college pursuing a double major in Networking/Information Security with a part time job that's unrelated and so far no job experience. Not sure of what to do after college if I have trouble finding a job. Considering Military or 4 year University.

f463s,7,2011-01-17,Long Distance Relationship with end in sight. BF losing hope. Help,inneedofhelp33,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f463s/long_distance_relationship_with_end_in_sight_bf/,"I don’t really know how to begin this plea as it’s quite a long story. I had an awful conversation with my boyfriend a couple of hours ago that has left me devastated. We agreed to hang up, calm down, and pick up the conversation later tonight. With an hour to go before we’re supposed to talk, so many thoughts are running through my head and I don’t know what to say to him when the time comes. 

I love my boyfriend so much. He’s my best friend. When we’re together everything is in sync. The catch is, however, that we’re rarely together (physically). We’ve been in a long distance relationship for three years. We both live in the same state but go to school in different states. We see each other over breaks and whenever we can manage during the semester. It’s hard to be apart. He’s a year older than me and is graduating this spring. At first I was nervous about what our future could bring as he is applying to graduate schools across the country and in the United Kingdom.. I was worried that after graduation, our long distance relationship wouldn’t end but continue. In the past months, we’ve had an amazing time together, studying abroad in the summer together and living together during that time. We talked about how we would try as hard as possible to live together after I graduated in 2012. I am determined to find a way to be with him. 

Today, he told me that it finally hit him that he couldn’t keep doing a long distance relationship for four more years. He admitted that if he was accepted to the schools in the U.K, he might end our relationship. I guess what he said was a fact. I mean, I don’t want to do long distance for four more years either. He seems so defeated when I feel ready to accept the challenge. I’m working hard to save money to be able to make a move to be with him. I am frustrated he thinks I won’t be able to follow him, or I won’t want to. 

He also told me he doesn’t want me to ignore what I want to do in life by moving to be with him. He knows what he wants to do for graduate school and a career but I don’t. I don’t see moving to be with him as ignoring my dreams because my dreams aren’t so clear. I think its important to share what you love doing with someone who you love and that’s what I want to do by being with him. Am I wrong? Isn’t it more important to have friends and family than a six digit salary? I mean, I do have dreams. I am a very motivated person. In fact, I’m starting an internship with Canadian Embassy in two days. I have a double major and I’ve studied abroad three times. 

The real kicker, the thing that hurt the most is what happened next. I’ve been waiting all weekend to hear from him. He said he was going to send me an email on Friday in which he would explicitly write all of the things he wants to do to me the next time we see each other, which is my birthday, the first weekend in February. We had ‘fun’ on skype on Thursday. I put on lingerie, took it off for him to see. He told me during our skype date that he had written two pages of the email. I begged him to give me a ‘preview’ but he wouldn’t. He told me today that he hadn’t been able to write a sentence. He wasn’t inspired. 

I love this man dearly. I’ve told him so many times that I am committed to becoming a ‘normal couple’ and ending our long distance as soon as possible. Yet he hasn’t applied to any schools in the area where I currently go to school. Maybe there wouldn’t be much of a point to that as I graduate as well in 2012. He’s applied to so many schools in cities that I’d want to live in.. Why is he in such a funk? My family thinks he’s being lazy and selfish. But is it instead that he’s just being painfully frank? Even still, I can’t help but be hurt by his words. Reddit, I’m feeling extremely low. I hope you can offer some advice. 

EDIT: I just called him, as we planned and he told me he's watching a movie.. he'll 'call me back in a half an hour. don't worry.' :/?"

I (male) am thinking of asking out a friend (female). We're both the same age, 22. We get along well, conversation flows well, we hang out when circumstances and time permits, etc.

Now to paint a more full picture: We're both University aged, I'm finishing up my last year and she recently graduated. We met a few years back through mutual friends. At the time she was with a guy, but hey I made a new friend. Fast forward a few months later, she's single and we chatted a good amount online. I wanted to ask her out, but I was away from University town on a short internship. Decide to wait until I get back, but SNAP, someone beat me to the punch. They start dating, etc. ""Oh well"", I think. I move on, try to look for other girls, etc. But we were still friends, the conversations were the same.

About a year later she's still in the relationship with the same guy. Me and her were hanging out once as friends, getting some wings. While we're talking she tells me that she had a crush on me at the same time I thought of asking her out. My mind let's out a big ""ffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu"", but also laughs. It is kind of funny. I also tell her some of my thoughts, and shrug it off as bad timing. Conversation moves on. So does life, I go around and about in the world, visit other countries, she eventually breaks up with this guy, goes out with a few more, etc.

Now recently, she's moved back to our University town for a job, where I am also currently in school. I also learnt that she is recently (a month or two, it's ""complicated"") single. My mind thinks ""Aha"". It likes to think I have a chance.

However, I am also wary that I let that one conversation propagate too far. I am aware that I may have been friend zoned, given the amount of stuff she opens up to me about in conversation.

So the question: Do you have advice or anecdotes on how to approach this? Should I let things build up and ask, or just propose it bluntly in the manner of ""Would you like to go out sometime""? Too direct perhaps?

**tl;dr: Thinking of asking out a friend who mentioned a while back that she had a crush. Advice on how to approach? **


******************************

Edit 1: ** Update ** After some conversation I am fairly sure I am hard in the friend zone. However, this wasn't found out through direct conversation of the topic, or asking her out. A culmination of some other recent conversations and those that happened tonight. Fairly sure she was hinting at me being a ""friend"" as well. Either way, I think I got the information I wanted. Que sera sera :). Thanks for the advice!

Edit 2: For clarification's sake, I'm sure I'm deep in the friend zone (or at the top of the friend ladder, depending on the theory you subscribe to) because of a conversation discussing her need to go on a date with someone to get her mind of her recent ex, but her saying it'd be weird with me because I'm a friend. I never did ask her directly on a date though; perhaps seems a bit cowardly of me. However, I feel like I know enough about the situation that I know not to get hung up on this and move on. The next mission is making sure to avoid the friend zone with people I meet in the future, ha.

If someone has tips on how to avoid becoming just a friend, advice would be good. But I think this chapter is closed :)."
f5cd5,11,2011-01-19,Summer internship opportunity,GeoManCam,geology,https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/f5cd5/summer_internship_opportunity/,"So, the company I am working for is a geologic research firm in Bratislava Slovakia, and I am looking for one *maybe* 2 more people for a summer internship. I am trying to cultivate a very international work environment and I will be accepting applications from around the world. The catch though, is that as we are a non-profit research firm, we are unable to pay for any expenses :(. However, we are accredited in the US and also for some European systems so school credit and scholarships may be up for grabs. Slovakia is very cheap, so living expenses are really quite minimum (I'm talking like, 60 euro a month for rent). 

The summer internship is a 3 month program in which I will teach you the basics of ArcGIS, Petrel, CorelDraw, Kingdom Suite as well as various other programs as they are needed. The Bratislava branch specializes in tectonics, sedimentology and geochemistry, so people in those fields will be filed to the top. 

We already have 1 intern coming from the U.S. and another from Spain. Our group here consists of Slovaks and 1 American (me), so the opportunity to meet people you never would meet normally is excellent here. 

We are only taking the best of the best as I don't want to have someone come over here, find out the beer and ladies are awesome and disappear on a 3 month bender. It's a hard internship, but it is completely worth it (in my opinion, of course). 

If you are interested, please contact me for more details!

*edit* Hey guys, so the internship language is English and experience can range from 2nd year undergrad to Ph.D. It's not so much the education I'm interested in, it's the ability to learn and have self motivation that I will require. Thanks! There are so many e-mails, so bear with me :)

f55k2,8,2011-01-19,Question: Transitioning into QA / Testing,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f55k2/question_transitioning_into_qa_testing/,"I have an Associates' degree in Network Administration.

I have 3 years' experience doing general IT Dept. technician work - answer phones, troubleshoot software issues, printers, etc., install/repair workstations, manage A.D. accounts, coordinate Lotus Notes accounts and set up client for new users, on-site setup and teardown for presentations, order paper and toner/ink for entire co., bill out toner/ink costs to those who use them, etc.

I have 3 more years' experience doing strictly computer hardware repair. Diagnosis, parts research, prepare quotes, coordinate parts orders, bill out repairs, blah blah blah.

I am tired of hardware repair, it is entirely boring and repetitive and frankly, it's a losing endeavor, it's so difficult to accurately diagnose issues when you have next to no known-good parts to troubleshoot with, especially when you work on virtually every cheap, crappy consumer-oriented entry-level laptop under the sun, and would have to have fifty different sets of parts. Worse, it's ruined my hands, I already had tendonitis in both hands before I switched over to working in repair, but working with small hand tools has put the cherry on top, my hands burn with fiery pain all day and all night. So I can't keep doing this too much longer, I keep dropping the tools onto the computers, it's only a matter of time before I crack an LCD panel or something, and cost my company even more than I've already cost them.

I don't really want to go back to general IT Dept help work, as I don't much like working directly with end-users, or answering the phone anymore. 

I'm really detail oriented, am extremely obsessive, a perfectionist, and am very process-driven. I am an extremely fast learner, as long as I'm taught in the right way. I think I'd be damn good at doing QA testing.

However I have no experience doing QA testing.

**TL;DR: I'd like suggestions, How best do I convince a company to hire me for a job doing QA, when my experience is elsewhere within IT simply due to the opportunities I've chosen to pursue this far?** 

What questions do I ask them, how do I convince them I have the ability to learn their QA on the fly, etc.

----

**EDIT THE NEXT DAY** : New question, what about Programming instead of QA?

I have very minimal background in HTML, JavaScript, and C++. What if -- because I don't want to start in Support -- could I try to arrange a train-in-three-months engineering intern gig or something? I can still put an idea into pseudo-code and create basic structure, I'm just rusty on the actual syntax, I'm sure that I could be back up to speed in a short amount of time...

And again -- How do I sell myself to them on this idea? What do I say, what do I write, who do I angle for, etc.

----

If not that -- then what other suggestions do you have? Should I just quit, cash my vacation out, and try like hell to get some mental illness treatment before starting another job and/or look into disability and work-from-home instead of a ""real"" job?

Because the bottom line is, **I'm too crazy to work with customers**, and I don't like people, and I don't want to talk to them, but I have to make $30k/yr or I will lose my house and my car. Plain and simple. No savings, no safety net, fuck it, do it live, all on the line here.

----

**Update from a week later: I finally got a call back about an internal transfer that I put in for approx. four months ago and had already forgotten entirely about. **Apparently they never got around to doing interviews -- they called me in, and after talking to me, offered me the spot. **So, I am going with the ""Stay in higher education, find a new position"" option mentioned below.**

My hope is that, in 2 years if I am still miserable within Higher Education, maybe I can quit my job and relocate to another state or country.

Thanks for all your feedback, guys!"

f4vao,14,2011-01-18,Mobile Business ,Mahoney311,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f4vao/mobile_business/,"I hesitated before I decided to share my story because it is very personal. I have never shared it with anyone except close family and friends. Also, it may be a little boring at first and seem long but it is the reason I believe in an afterlife. 


When I was 12 my parents bought a new house across town. Even though it was in the same town I grew up in, unfortunately it ended up being in a different school district so I had to move schools. It ended up being a great thing for me because I met one of my best friends and we'll call her Jackie. 

Jackie and I stayed close throughout school and eventually parted ways and went to different colleges. I ended up moving across the country with my now husband and she stayed closer to home. Although we were so far apart, we remained close and talked on the phone often. 

My husband and I had a baby girl while we were living away. I came home with the baby a few months after she was born so that many of my friends and family could meet her. Jackie stayed the entire day at my side with my new daughter. It is a fond memory for me. 

In September, I got a phone call from Jackie for my birthday. Everything seemed normal and she sounded happy enough. My husband was offered an internship that was back in Chicago where we are from so Jackie and I talked about how excited we both were to have a reunion in January, just a few short months away. We said our good-byes and said that we would talk to each other again soon. 

About a week went by and my husband just left to go to work. I was at home with the baby and put her in her crib for a nap. She had this mobile above her crib that she was in love with. It played pretty music and had little fishies and such that hung down and sang her a lullaby. Eventually,  the baby fell asleep and I was sitting in the living room reading a book. 20 minutes past and all of a sudden I heard the mobile's lullaby. I peeked in the room and sure enough, there was the mobile turning in circles with the music playing as if I had just turned it myself. The baby was sleeping so I just played it off in my mind that there was a kink in the mobile and it just started playing again. 

My husband eventually came home and I of course told him about the mobile. He reassured me that it was probably nothing and we went about our lives. Well, we were all sitting in the living room, baby in arms, and there goes the mobile.. singing its sweet lullaby. This happened SEVERAL times throughout the evening..my husband was not allowed to leave me alone in ANY room by myself. 

The next day I got a phone call that my friend had hung herself the day before all of the mobile business started. You can imagine how ripped apart I was. I didn't really put the mobile business together with the suicide until about a month after everything happened. I strongly believe it was Jackie coming to say she was there. Maybe she knew I was going to find out and she wanted to give me a sign before that she was okay? Maybe she was saying good-bye.

I had a dream that I was walking up to a parked car. I looked in through the driver's side window and my friend, Jackie was sitting in the passenger seat. The only thing she said to me was ""please forgive me"" and I looked at her and just told her I wasn't ready to do that yet and walked onward. I remember ever single detail as if it were real. 

Months later I always felt her presence especially while I was in the car alone. I would tell her to leave me alone and then the feeling would pass.. it took me a long time to forgive her in my heart. 

Eventually I did get to the point of forgiveness and alone, in the car I said out loud to her that I forgave her and knew she was still around. That very same night I had another very real dream that Jackie and I met on a beach that we visited frequently in high school. We embraced and I remember my heart overflowing with love and happiness to get to feel her in my arms again. 

To this day, weird things seem to follow me. I was working once and a vase started to twirl out of the blue. It really freaked out a co-worker of mine but I honestly believe its her just messing around with people around me so she can see a smile on my face :)

So, if I go through with it, I'll have about 8 months of ""dead time"" which I feel I should do something useful with. I can default to living in my current college town and getting a job or internship somewhere, but I feel like I should be a bit more bold. One idea I've had is doing an exchange program abroad in the summer (taking courses related to the program I intend to transfer to), although that still leaves the time between now and then. Does anyone have any interesting suggestions, or anything they would consider doing if they were in my position? I should also note that I am relatively financially stable (read: have some disposable income), and have few obligations which would make it necessary for me to stay in one particular place at the moment."

I am a senior in college and looking for work come May.  I have a great resume and a lot experience in construction (worked for a large regional subcontractor as an intern doing sales, project management etc).  A few months ago I went through two rounds of interviews with a large, multinational construction firm.  The interview was for an entry level, typical post grad construction position.  Prior to the second interview, my Mom went to lunch with her best friend, who is the mother of one of my best friends from childhood.  He and I haven't kept up much over the years, but they are like family to us.  My mom tells his mom (as mom's do when proud of their children) that I got an interview scheduled with Company X.  My friend’s mom later nonchalantly relays this information about my potential success to her husband. She told him this to update him on me and my family, not to be conniving.  The husband is an incredibly important businessman in the city (and arguably the nation) I am from.  He gets on the phone, pulls some strings, and arranges an interview for his son (childhood friend) for the same position I am interviewing for.  The kid completely skips the first round of interviews and goes right to the second round, which is basically the final step before getting hired.  His son is a perennial fuckup who is in a severely watered down version of my degree at a much smaller school.  He has no internship or field experience…I have 2 years.  Everything this child has ever gotten has been given to him.  Fast forward to today, and I find out that my best friend got the job over me.  The only thing that could have gotten him the job over me is his father.  He would have never even known that Company X was hiring had I not earned the second interview and my mom proudly told her friend.  My mom feels horrible because she feels at fault for telling my friend’s mom about my interview (which she shouldn’t, because she didn’t know that the d-bag husband would pull such a tacky move).  

I have other job prospects, but if I had gotten this job everything would have been secure and I could have begun focusing all of my efforts on graduating.  All of my other prospects are only that…prospects.  Almost nobody in construction is hiring, and I am incredibly worried none of my prospects will pan out.  I feel helpless and essentially neutered in my job search.  Anybody have advice on how I should handle this? Should I say something to my friend’s dad?  My friend is probably too dumb to realize what happened.  Does anybody else have a story like this so I don’t feel like I’m the only one who this ever happened to?

tl;dr: Friend’s dad got him the job that I earned, and the only reason he knew about the job was because I earned 2 interviews for it.

My current GPA is 2.95 while my major GPA is a 3.4 and the required GPA for this internship is a 2.8. Should I put in my current GPA or should I just leave my major GPA in there?
I have a VERY chinese name and I'm quite frankly embarrassed by it. Do I need to put in my real legal name on the resume or can I put my Americanized name that everyone calls me?

Classes are boring or just uneventful and I don't feel like I'm taking advantage of these years of my life. I am a CS major in the bay area, if this is relevant.

No, people -- I don't want internships. I don't want to work at a startup. I don't want to volunteer. I don't want to attend talks. I did all these things at high school to get me to this place. I don't want to relive high school for another four years.

Where do I find people that are passionate about projects, about changing the world? People here don't dream. They fap, fuck, eat, read. And they pay mad money to do it. 

The people that say they are passionate about these things join entrepreneurship clubs and organize talks weekly. Others are true scholars -- passionate about knowledge, about the epistemology of it all. This is admirable, but it doesn't interest me either. The few and the courageous are the ones that drop out, but I am not bold enough to take that leap without an IPO.

Work at a startup, you say? Done that. I got bored easily. I tried founding my own company too, but it failed hard and fast because every undergrad got too busy with their own stuff (including me). In the end, I don't find the passion in myself to sustain myself in such a thing. It wasn't nearly as glamorous as it looked, and I found that I was partially in it for the fame.

The only thing I am good at now is classes. I know what professors are looking for, and I can deliver. I hate that this is what I am good at.

Maybe I got too cynical too fast. What do I do reddit? Take time off? Travel the world? Run a triathlon? How do I cultivate a passion in something -- anything? Teach me how to care -- and how to make a difference."

Also, I feel like I should mention I am doing an actual thesis so its not like I'd be applying somewhere with absolutely no research experience. So here are my questions:

Would taking an internship on my last summer as an undergraduate hurt my grad school chances?
I realize there are plenty of good reasons to go grad school, but do any of you see the current benefits of a CS major going through grad school that early?
Do you recommend grad school for a CS major at all?

tl;dr can't figure out how to decide the next few years of schooling - thoughts on CS grad school?"

So here's my story: I'm currently studying towards a master's degree (as defined by European standards, which makes things a little different) in a French business school and I need to find an internship. It can be anywhere and in any company, but it has to last around six months (June - December of this year).

As you have probably guessed, that's not really your common internship duration and when you add on top of that the fact that I need to get visa sponsorship, it makes it really hard. Now I know that I could find something anywhere in Europe without having to get approved by immigration but I'm just not interested in that. I feel that my work experience won't be really different from what I currently know.

EDIT: I should also mention that I have previous work experience in an US-owned company and some extra-curricular activities (chair. of a student group of photography ~20 people)

EDIT2: Can't edit the title.

EDIT3: Canada is fine too, but I heard their visa requirements were even worse.

So Reddit, I need advice: how do I go about finding this sorta thing?"

I'm not successful, but feel that I am on track to be successful.  I am graduate student in CS. I work with a MAJOR tech company in Silicon Valley and am making connections. I will most likely grab an internship that graduates from MIT will be begging for, even though I go to a small state school. I am published in research, and I love my field.  I love learning and feel that I can learn and contribute to the future of the human species. I now lecture at a University for CS stuff and writing. 

I am also terribly alone. I have loving, adorable wife, but  most of my day is spent alone in front of a computer: surfing the web, reading reddit (another addiction of mine), and then drinking, drinking, drinking. Occasionally (though not recently) I go out on the search for the hard dope. 

I'm winning the up hill battle from working class poor into middle class.  I have a shot at real opportunities... 

But I also spend days on end stuck in my room or apartment recovering from my hangovers. I spend weeks with physical manifestations of anxiety and guilt regarding all of my stupid decisions and regrets. I spontaneously shout out, as if in pain, when I think about the stupid shit I've done. I get kicked out of bars, and I piss random people off. 

I live in a upscale part of town next to a very famous university (that I don't attend). I thought that living here would make me drink less because of all the rich white people and education, but all it does is make me feel like I don't belong here, so I drink alone in my apartment and watch movies.   My drinking fuels my anxiety.

But I haven't hit bottom. 

I still have opportunities. I still impress people. I can speak in front of large crowds (probably my most marketable skill), but with individuals, I am gimped.  

Do I HAVE to hit rock bottom? I don't want to lose these opportunities. 

I have a drinking problem. I know this. It can unravel me.  

I just found /r/alcoholism tonight.  Yes, I've been drinking.  "

For various reasons, I never had any internships as an undergrad doing development. Now that I've graduated and am unemployed, I have no idea what to do (no interest in hardware engineering), because I'm not really qualified for any developer positions.

I started an internship at a large company about two years ago, and back then I was a complete tool and a loser (even more than I am now). After a few months of sitting at my cubicle from 9-5 and never socializing, surprisingly I was invited to an after work party. We all ended up drinking, having a great time, and becoming good friends.

Unfortunately, today is my best friend and fellow Redditor [AMYALIDA](http://www.reddit.com/user/amyalida)'s last day at work. She's moving out of state and will be roughly a three hour drive away from where I live. I'm incredibly bummed that we're going to be so far apart. On top of that, today is the two year anniversary of her father passing away. We usually have a blast at work together, but given the circumstances I was half-expecting today to be more sad and depressing than enjoyable.


**------THE PRESENTS------**


**Anti-Diarrhea Medicine** - Amy majored in Psychology and is in the process of finishing up grad school now. She's going to be a therapist that specializes in marriage and family counseling. Since her clients will lie to her in an attempt to look like ""the good person"" in the relationship, Amy will undoubtedly have so much verbal diarrhea spewed at her. By keeping this medicine on her desk, she can simply tap the box to let her clients know that they're spewing BS.

*Side Note* I wasn't exactly sure what my best choice was here. I was browsing through the laxative aisle, but nothing jumped out at me. I went to speak with the pharmacist and asked him, ""What's the opposite of a laxative?"" He looked at me strangely and I just stood there silently for a few awkward seconds, and he eventually chimed in with, ""Well, we have Immodium that helps with diarrhea, it's in aisle nine."" I said, ""Perfect!"" and was on my way.

**Listerine Strips** - This goes hand in hand with the Immodium. Having shit spew out of your mouth would surely give you bad breath, so this is simply a must have for any therapist.

**Kleenex** - Amy is going to be dealing with a lot of cry-babies in her line of work. Hell, every time I had a problem with my girlfriend I would go crying to her. If Amy's clients are even half as over-sensitive as I am, then tissues are a must have. Alternatively, because some couples in therapy will be fighting, there's a good chance that the guys won't be getting laid. Luckily, Amy will be able to offer lonely males free tissues to help clean-up after their ""alone time.""

**Seventeen Magazine** - Let's face the facts people; everybody knows that majoring in psych is a joke. You're going to waste tons of money and years of your life learning a bunch of useless facts. Right now, Amy thinks happy couples should listen to each other, care about their partner's well being, and ""love"" each other, but she couldn't be more wrong. Hopefully this magazine will show her the light - if her female clients become dangerously skinny, dress like whores, and know forty-seven ways to please their men in bed, then Amy is destined to be a marriage savior.

**Fancy Feast** - Amy and her mom are absolutely in love with their two dogs. Recently, her friend Courtney baked special treats for Amy's dogs. The treats were just like regular cookies except without sugar (so they taste god-awful). Amy took a bite out of one, and needless to say it wasn't pleasant. I decided I would also get Amy a present for her dog, so I bought Fancy Feast cat food. This way it will probably taste better if Amy chooses to eat it (with the obvious ironic twist that cat food isn't meant for dogs).

**Used Pens** - Yesterday, Amy was at the desk of our old program manager (let's call her Chrissy). Amy commented on how organized Chrissy was; specifically, Amy was impressed with the way Chrissy color-coded events on her calendar. In a completely serious manner, Chrissy dug through her desk, found a few different colored pens, and said, ""Here you go Amy. I want you to have these. I hope you use them in the future."" That was Chrissy's only parting gift to Amy. Not to be outdone, I snagged a free box of pens from the supply closet. Before giving them to Amy, I tore open the box, threw away the caps to a few pans, and even chewed on one to make it look as used as possible. I will never be outdone.

I also bought Amy some Ghirardelli chocolates and Nutter Butter. There isn't a punch line or funny anecdote here - these desserts just kick ass.


**------CONCLUSION------**


I'm really happy with how today turned out. It sucks that the person who actually made me enjoy going to work every day is going to be leaving, but at the same time I'm glad that she's moving on to bigger and better things.

I wasn't sure how today was going to pan out at all. I knew it was going to be an emotional day for Amy because of the anniversary of her father's passing, but I was really hoping that we'd have a positive and memorable experience on our last day of working together. Amy absolutely loved the gifts, and I couldn't possibly be any happier with the way things turned out today. I hope the reddit community gets as much enjoyment from this story as I did.

**EDIT** - I can post this part now because it's after work. I had a little crush on her for a while, but nothing would ever happen because she's two years older and we're good friends. She didn't want to make a big deal out of goodbyes today, so her goodbyes to other people were casual. I was the only person to get a goodbye hug and now I feel like Barack Obama! Damn it feels good to be a gansta.

[Final Product](http://i.imgur.com/m0BSL.jpg)

-**TL;DR**-

* Best friend / co-worker moving away for good today, also two year anniversary of her father's death.
* I buy a bunch of presents that seem lame, but there's a meaning to each gift.
* Potential setup for a depressing day ends up being a feel-good story for the day!
* I got hugged, feel like a boss.

By keeping this medicine on her desk, she can simply tap the box to let her clients know that they're spewing BS.
	
	*Side Note* I wasn't exactly sure what my best choice was here. I was browsing through the laxative isle, but nothing jumped out at me. I went to speak with the pharmacist and asked him, ""What's the opposite of a laxative?"" He looked at me strangely and I just stood there silently for a few seconds, and eventually he chimed in with, ""Well, we have Immodium that helps with diarrhea, it's in isle nine."" I said, ""Perfect!"" and was on my way.

	Listerine Strips - This goes hand in hand with the Immodium. Having shit spew out of your mouth would surely give you bad breath, so this is simply a must have for any therapist. 

	Kleenex - Amy is going to be dealing with a lot of cry-babies in her line of work. Hell, every time I had a problem with my girlfriend I would go crying to her. If Amy's clients are even half as over-sensitive as I am, then tissues are a must have. Alternatively, because some couples in therapy will be fighting, there's a good chance that the guys won't be getting laid. Luckily, Amy will be able to offer lonely males free tissues to help clean-up after their ""alone time.""

	Seventeen Magazine - Let's face the facts people, everybody knows that majoring in psych is a joke. You're going to waste tons of money and years of life learning a bunch of useless facts that you'd never use. Right now, Amy thinks happy couples listen to each other, care about their partner's well being, and ""love"" each other, but she couldn't be more wrong. Hopefully this magazine will show her the light - if her female clients become dangerously skinny, dress like whores, and know forty-seven ways to please their men in bed, then Amy is destined to be a marriage savior.
	
	Fancy Feast - Amy and her mom are absolutely in love with their two dogs. Recently, her friend Courtney made special treats for Amy's dog. The treats were just like regular cookies except without sugar (so they taste god-awful). Amy took a bite out of one of the treats, and needless to say it wasn't pleasant. I decided I would get Amy a present for her dog too, so I bought Fancy Feast cat food. This way it will probably taste better if Amy chooses to eat it (with the obvious ironic twist that dogs don't eat cat food).

	Used Pens - Yesterday, Amy was at the desk of our old program manager (let's call her Chrissy). She commented on how organized Chrissy was; specifically, Amy was impressed with the way Chrissy color-coded events on her calendar. In a completely serious manner, Chrissy dug through her desk, found a few different colored pens and said, ""Here you go Amy. I want you to have these. I hope you use them in the future."" That was Chrissy's parting gift to Amy. Not to be outdone, I snagged a free box of pens from the supply closet. Before giving them to Amy, I tore open the box, threw away the caps to a few pens, and even chewed on one to make it look as used as possible. I will never be outdone.

	I also bought her some Ghirardelli chocolates and Nutter Butter. There isn't a punch line or funny anecdote here - these deserts just kick ass.

**CONCLUSION**

	I'm really happy with how today turned out. It sucks that the person who actually made me enjoy going to work every day is going to be leaving, but at the same time I'm glad that she's moving on to bigger and better things. 

	I wasn't sure how today was going to pan out at all. I knew it was going to an emotional day for Amy because of the anniversary of her father's passing, but I was really hoping that we'd have a blast on our last day of working together. Amy absolutely loved the gifts, and I couldn't possibly be any happier with the way things turned out today. I hope the reddit community gets as much enjoyment from this story as I did.

Right now I'm working at a small company handling their accounting.  Easy job, a bit chaotic, but not demanding and the pay is great.  I'm interested in starting a small business eventually and so this is great experience, the owner seems interested in helping me figure out a business etc.

While working for this small business, I've also been looking for public accounting jobs.  No dice.  I believe it's due to my undergrad GPA (3.2) and no public accounting experience (I loaded up and finished a year early for financial reasons, but skipped the usual junior year internship).

More and more, in my current job, I realize my own limitations.  I understand what I need to do, but haven't had any practice at it, so I spend time educating myself through trial and error.  The result is that I'm pretty convinced that public accounting is where I need to be.

Right now I'm not in the city I grew up in, and will finish my Master's and sit for the CPA exam this summer.  If I go back home, I'm relatively sure I can find a public accounting job at a smaller firm.

So, having heard my situation, what are your thoughts?

Will my experience in my current position help (prepared financial statements, some cost analysis and budgeting) in future interviews?  Would I be able to enter public accounting later if I chose?  Is a smaller firm worth the move?

Thanks all."

DAE have advice or suggestions on how to start?,[deleted],gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/f6cwn/im_a_recent_grad_and_hardcore_gamer_that_is/,"Pretty much the title. I've been out of college for almost 2 years now. and live in the Bay Area. I've been playing video games since I was the age of 2, have played every console out there - switched mainly to PC / online games when I was 12 with Team Fortress Classic and Counter-Strike. My two favorite types of games are first person shooters and role playing games. At the age of 14 I was a member of a Counter-Strike clan that reached the world #2 ranking for a month or so. In college I played World of Warcraft for over 250 days played over the course of two years and was a member of a hardcore raiding guild which was Top 20 in the United States in terms of raid progression for the majority of instances in vanilla WoW. In Halo 3, I reached the top level of 50, a feat that put me in the 98th and 99th percentiles of all Halo players based on skill. 

 I believe that I have an ability to strategically figure out a game and exploit all its edges to my advantage. By studying the game via online resources such as forums or videos, I am constantly in touch with the user-base of a certain game and can therefore pinpoint a trending strategy or thought process of the majority of players. I then use this information to formulate counter-strategies to the trending strategy to stay in front of the competition. By being a part of the user base of a game, I also am constantly aware of what some of the better marketing and advertising strategies are to target the players on all skill levels. 

I am looking for a career in this industry because gaming is my passion. It comes naturally to me and it is something I can endlessly think about and work on... but I have no idea where to start / how to get a job at a major gaming company. Also, not even sure what I would be doing at a company - I'm not sure what i'd be good at. I've had a few marketing internships in the past though. I live in the Bay Area.

Applying to jobs online seems almost futile as many of the jobs listed require experience, and also my resume probably doesn't even get looked at 99% of the time. Sorry, I know this is long, and a semi-plug, but I thought I might as well give it a shot here in the reddit community. &lt;3

I mean, we were good friend througout high school, hung out a lot, I went to school 1500 miles away and he stayed in state (we both are third year uni students now), we IM almost once a week up util this past year when I had an internship in the city, but we still texted every now and then.

I never acted in a way to diminish our friendship, and neither did he, but I dunno wtf someone would act this way? I feel like I may have done something wrong but can't begin to identify it. Maybe he's just being a little bitch, I don't know.

The idea was to make the shark's body with the words. The intention was to make the K = tail, W = head, and the ""A"" from Shark, the fin.

About the colours, I thought about putting the red on the upper side, like it's a above / under the water thing, with the red being a sunset color or something like that, and the shark, being underwater, with a different color (with the fin aswell).

Tryed to make the fin coming from one of the E's, but don't liked how it was going ...

The idea is not to make a logo or anything, but more an Idea, that could be used in Ads and stuff (obviously, not just in this form. One of my main problems is to find good free pictures and stuff).

I really enjoy writing, but I have nothing to write about. I'm not really sure how to get started, aside from my commenting on Reddit, which I'm sure does not count for much. 

**I'd ultimately like to turn writing into a career** - not as an author, but as, say, a technical writer or research analyst (vs. say, spreadsheet, database or other technical analyst), but that's not important at the moment. 

**I'd just like to lay down the groundwork and start writing as a hobby and/or side job. **

**I'd like to hear how you or someone you know got started in writing (both as a hobby and as a career), as well as any other suggestions you may have.**

A bit about me:
I have no formal writing experience, although writing has been a major part of 2 of my internships. I have no formal training - my education is in accounting and mathematics.

They want to transition the support model, i.e. me, to mostly remote support. 

I am pissed. Transitioning to a remote support model will take at least 6 months. Not to mention, I am now the only one with extensive knowledge about this company's setup, applications, etc.

* How can I stand out of the crowd?
* What skills do employers expect a graduate in finance to have? Like excel and other such things. What do they expect me to have done so I look more eligible?

As an International Student in this western country; it is very difficult to get a job if you don't have citizenship or some sort of permanent residency. I don't want to go back to my home country because job opportunities suck plus I am really embarrassed that I have become such a failure and I don't want to face old friends/distant relatives. I am eligible for applying citizenship and I will be doing it soon but it takes an year and a half or more to get it. In the mean while I just want to do my best and start turning things around.

I am about to complete a BA in Criminal Justice here in San Antonio. I am suppose to do an internship in the summer in order to complete my degree, but all the choices given to me are mainly police, law or judicial. I took an intro class for Computer Forensics as well as an intro class for forensics in general. I find that computer forensics/security is something I would like to get into. 

Ive been told that Computer Forensics is a rather new field so a lot of it is learning from the job. However I am unsure of places to check for an internship. The University I attend does not offer a computer forensic degree unfortunately. If need be there is a community college that offers a certificate program for computer forensics but I would like to use this internship to my advantage to gain some experience, even if it is just me shadowing over someone doing the actual work.

Anyway, here follows my account of the time I stayed in an old 'haunted' hotel in Southern France.

I went to have my internship in this little village in southern France called Foix, in the department if Ariege. My boss knew the owner of this hotel and he made an arrangement so I could stay there for a few months, which I did. The Village had about 5k people. 

Anyway, I went to this hotel, three stories with also a basement and a garage. It was fairly old, 200+ years overlooking the city centre, an old fortress and the stunning mountains. 

I arrived in the beginning of winter, it was very low season and they had closed the hotel for renovation, they would only accept guests by appointment. For the first week they keep people in the reception but I told them I didn't really need any service, just a place to crash, internet and that was it. I had the key to the front door and they told me that they would close up.  Long story short I was the only living soul in that house, I would come home from work to find a completely darkened entrance, I would then turn on the lights and slowly climb the stairs. I stayed first on the third floor and then I moved to the second. But still I had to walk through some really dark hallways, the floors were wooden so they made some noise when I walked by. I remember very well that when I walked to my room, there was a mirror at the end of the hallway which I avoided looking at all costs, sometimes I did look and I thought I would see something, a white hue or fog but I dismissed as my mind was playing tricks on me. 

Once I got to my room I would turn on the lights and lock the door, even though I was the only one there. The rooms were comfy, but sometimes at night I would wakeup in the middle of the night with this ungodly cold, most of the time I blamed the winter and the fact that the house was old, but I am not ashamed to say I used to cover myself from head to toe sometimes so I wouldn't 'see' anything. 

Was there noise, oh god yes. It was an old house and it made a great deal of noise, on top of that I blamed the pigeons. Sometimes it seemed like someone was walking on the floor above.

I am an engineer and I am pretty logically minded, so most of the time I tried to find a logical explanation or assumed my mind was playing tricks on me. The owners of the hotel even asked me if I wasn't scared of staying there, and I said I wasn't. They told me they had a few guests that had been spooked and checked out a little earlier than expected.

I must say that the creepiest part of the whole thing was the mirror at the end of the hall, sometimes I thought I saw a female in a white dress, but as always I dismissed as me being paranoid. Other times I had the impression of seeing a girl sneaking a peak from one of the (closed and firmly locked) rooms as I walked by the hallway.

At the end of it I was actually looking forward to seeing something, but I never got to see something concrete. I confess that I never went exploring into the basement area

I had a great time there and left after 5 months. Looking back I really miss the place and it was a nice experience. I will definitely go back there one day. 

Oh yeah, the village also had a rather large cemetery nearby, I used to take walks in the morning before going to work and I used to pass by it. Here is a streetview picture.

After passing the intersection of Royal Palm Blvd. and Country isles rd., I see a black car start switching to the right most side turn lane, I proceed to speed up and pass him. Upon reaching the intersection of Royal Palm Blvd. and Weston rd. I notice I needed gas so I get on the right most turn lane. There are two gas stations there, which are Exxon and Mobil. I am waiting at the stop light at this intersection to turn right when suddenly a black car pulls up on my left side. No sirens were heard and no lights were on, I suddenly see a man maybe 200- 220 pounds about 6’2 come out dressed all in black with no official uniform. I notice he was charging at me with a violent expression on his face, and a hand near a side arm. I immediately feared for my life and hit the gas on my motorcycle trying to escape what I thought was a threat upon me. I turned right immediately on Weston Rd. weaving in and out of traffic trying to escape and protect myself from either serious bodily harm or death. I drove maybe 2 blocks down Weston rd. and did a U turn, trying to find a crowded environment for safety. Upon U turning I notice the lights on the Vehicle chasing me and immediately I stop. Upon Stopping I was tackled to the ground and stepped on. I was then hand cuffed. I told the police officers that I did not know they were police officers, and that I believed they were about to attack or kill me in the first confrontation. The officer who first got out of the car then proceeded to tell me and I quote: “that if I wanted to attack you I had enough time to do so.” If the officer had enough time to attack me how come he did not use any of this time to declare who he was? In the first initial encounter there was no siren, no lights, and no declaration of any kind that he was an officer of the law. I saw a well-built man dressed all in black charging at me with a deadly weapon and I feared for my life. I was then arrested and driven to their facility where they took all my property. What I believe happened is this, Police officers do not turn on any lights or sirens against motorcycle riders until they get close enough. This prevents them from getting scared and fleeing because they know they will have a hard time catching a sport bike. What these cops did was discriminate me and even after catching up they did not give any sign of warning or declaration of who they were. Here are some things about me which I can prove: I have just graduated from the university with a 3.5gpa cum laude, I have a 760 credit score with 100% on time payment, I just got a great internship at one of the best companies to work for in America, My license says safe driver, I am motorcycle endorsed, I am registered as an organ donor, I have a clean driving record, I do my taxes, I have done my jury duty, my motorcycle is registered under my sunpass, the bike’s tag is registered and up to date, and I am a law abiding citizen. I have absolutely no reason to run from the law, besides the fact they didn’t declare they had any affiliation with the law, until after they tackled and damaged my motorcycle (undrivable), helmet, and sending me to jail. I feel they wanted revenge because I passed them when they were changing lanes.  They discriminated against me and abused their power. 

What can I do? I need a lawyer now and not sure if I should go with ticket clinic or something. any advice appreciated. thanks

They charged me with reckless driving misdemeanor and sent me to jail for the night comments on the ticket: weaving in and out of traffic at high speeds. "
f7kwf,6,2011-01-23,Hoping to get an internship.  Any advice?,Foolra56,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/f7kwf/hoping_to_get_an_internship_any_advice/,"Just got told this subreddit existed after I posted a VITA AMA thread the other day.  

A little background:  I'm a senior majoring in accounting and will graduate in December.  I started college in 2001 and did three years before basically deciding to take a break, which turned into almost 6 years.  I finally decided to go back and chose accounting.  I'm currently taking intermediate II and tax accounting as well as other business courses, so I feel like I've gotten through most of the actual accounting coursework and am doing very well at it (4.0 since I came back to school).

I am looking to try to find an internship with a public accounting firm and wanted to get some advice about how to go about it.  There is a Dixon Hughes office like 3 minutes from my house and I figured that would be a good option.  

Is it appropriate to just walk in and ask to talk to somebody about an internship?  Or should I e-mail or call first to try to get a name and contact that person directly?  

I am doing all kinds of things to try to help myself look more appealing to potential recruiters when I graduate - the Volunteer Income Tax thing I'm doing and I am also tutoring with my university for business classes.

I am going to join the IMA here shortly.  Any other professional organizations it would be beneficial for me to join as a student?  Or any other general advice to hopefully help me actually have a job when I graduate?

Thanks in advance and hope to learn a lot from this subreddit!"

f7kh3,3,2011-01-23,"I did the traveling, I will do the internship abroad, 
am I being unreasonable to my girlfriend if I want 
more?",throwaway2222484,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/f7kh3/i_did_the_traveling_i_will_do_the_internship/,"Hi there, I don't have any acute problems, but I've been thinking about this a lot lately and I just wanted some opinions on this. 

I'm together with my girlfriend for about 3,5 years. We're both 22. We have a very healthy relationship. I can't imagine myself being with someone else. 

I like traveling, a lot. It's probably my #1 passion. I also traveled alone while I was in a relationship with my girlfriend, 2 months to country a, 1 month to country b. Besides that, I went on a vacation with my girlfriend two times to less exotic places, but they were great holidays too. I really like traveling with my girlfriend, but I also really like traveling alone. My girlfriend doesn't have a passion for traveling. She has no desire to go to strange places and doesn't want to be away from home for a long time, so I'm afraid I can't share this passion with her.

About a year ago we talked about our future plans and I talked about that I wanted to do an internship abroad. Later she told me that she would probably break up with me if I would be away for more than 6 months. Now, this can look really bad (knowing the reddit hivemind), but it was absolutely not meant as a threat and I didn't perceive it as such, she was just saying it. Later she softened her attitude about this. I did pursue an internship after all and I got one, I will be away for 5 months. Although she wasn't too happy with me being away for 5 months, she really supported me and was genuinely happy for me, knowing what it meant for me. She isn't going to break up with me or anything. She will visit me while I'm away. I was initially against this because I think it only will be harder for the both of us, but after a while I thought that it would be a small compromise to make and I'm looking forward to show her around and share my passion.

Okay, so this internship isn't really a problem. But, a few months back we talked, and I don't remember the context anymore, but she was sad about me leaving for 5 months  and she wanted me to promise that, besides my internship, I wouldn't go abroad for a large amount of time. I told her that I couldn't make that promise because I don't know what the future will bring, but that I don't have any plans.

But lately I'm thinking that I do want to go away for a long time after I finished my study. We're talking about 2,5 years from now, but eventually I want to make a very long trip if possible. I would also love to do another internship abroad. I'm always dreaming about destinations, ways to get to obscure places and stuff like that, but I'm afraid to talk to my girlfriend about that. I really love my girlfriend and I don't want to lose her, but I also really want to travel.

Am I being unfair here for wanting more and more even though I had my share of traveling? Should I be upset if my girlfriend doesn't want me to go abroad? The point is that I know it's unreasonable for a girl to deny her boyfriend to grab that one golden chance and go away for 6 months for traveling/internship/whatever. When you're young and you have that opportunity you should do it, no matter what. But I did a lot of traveling and I will do an internship, is it unreasonable for me to want to grab more than one ""golden opportunities""? 

This isn't an acute problem, there won't be a problem for a minimum of 1,5 years and I don't have any real plans or anything, but I would like to have your opinion because it bugs me. I'm not a native speaker, so maybe some parts of my story aren't exactly as I intended them.

Thanks!"

He sometimes has guy night with his friends and he also has certain nights a week where he raids in World of Warcraft (Sun-Mon,Wed-Thurs) All of which I am totally cool with.

But recently in January he started an internship at an Advertising company. He is there almost everyday from 9-5 sometimes 6pm. He comes home at 5 and naps until 11pm(his time, 9pm my time). I have school so either I have to go to sleep earlier, or he has raid which starts at 9. Needless to say I haven't really been spending as much time as I used to with him and it's making me feel weird. I don't want to seem needy but I feel really lonely and I don't really know what to do with myself during the free time I have. I just get really bored and when we do end up talking, I just feel really annoyed and mad at him.

Last week, I found out that I could not continue my studies in my engineering major anymore due to my poor performance (which are the result of a disability and also somewhat because of a lack of interest in my major). I was in my fourth year of school (with one year remaining) and I have just been trying to muscle through it and get my degree but my grades have dropped too low. A transfer to another major at my university is also not possible since I do not meet the minimum GPA requirement.

My parents believe that I need a degree to be successful in life, and being successful in life to them means making money. However, I'm not naive enough to agree with them on that. I am not looking to make extravagant amounts of money, I just want to make enough to live comfortably and be able to go out every once in  a while, and maybe even enjoy my work.

I have some work experience during college doing some lab internships, but I did not really enjoy that type of work and couldn't see myself doing it for a living. It's my goal to work and live in an Asian country, preferably in China. I am originally from China and I can speak decent enough Chinese (but not read or write), and am fluent in English. One job that I think I would really enjoy is being an English teacher, but many places require you to have a bachelor's degree, from what I have gathered.

Also, I think I have read stories on Reddit of people just straight up leaving their life behind and starting over in Japan or something, and I'm not too clear on the details. How would that work?

Everything else in my life outside of academics is fine, I'm not depressed or crazy or anything, I'm very fit, I have good friends, etc.

I'm really at a loss right now as to what I should do with my life.
I'm willing to learn another language, learn a trade, earn some certifications, basically do whatever it takes. "

There's a good chance he might read this, as he introduced me to Reddit, but whatever. 

I broke up with my boyfriend of 3.5 years about a month ago (He's 22, I'm 21), and I'm still processing; I think it's finally starting to really hit me, and I miss him a lot. 

We started dating pretty soon after starting college (we'd been in the same social circle for several years before that) and have dated pretty solidly throughout. I thought we always had a pretty good relationship; we've argued on and off, but never very often or very seriously. 

I guess I think the big reason we called it quits was we just kind of grew apart. I'm close to graduating and starting to think about life after college, but he's still got a year or two (he's double-majoring, and working full-time as well).  I'm a science major, so I started to fill a lot of my time with internships and lab work, etc, and we weren't able to spend as much time together. I would be up and gone pretty early, and he would work into the evenings. We would only have maybe an hour or two before I had to go to bed, and rather than spending any time together, he would do something else. I laid a lot of the blame on him, but I think we both just kind of stopped prioritizing each other. 

When we had more free times on weekends, we still wouldn't do much together. We hardly went out, and when we did, one or the other of us wouldn't bother trying to enjoy ourselves. He also started to get very negative and critical, picking at every fault-he even commented negatively on my weight a few times; a big turnaround from the caring and supportive guy I was used to. I began to feel ignored and unappreciated, no matter how many times we talked about it. 

Let me pause here before everyone starts to think what a horrible guy he is--he's really not. 9 months ago when our relationship was stronger, he would always go out of his way to make me feel special and appreciated, even if it was just giving me a hug every time he saw me. He's never raised a hand towards anyone, he works really hard at work and at school, he's a great friend, brother, and son, and he's probably just about the most caring, loyal guy I've ever met. There would be no danger of him cheating, either, even if I did gain a little bit of holiday weight--he's terribly uncomfortable around most girls, and I stayed over a lot-5+ nights a week. 
Besides that, a lot of smaller things happened--he quit paying for dates altogether; blew me off to play video games or drink with his roommates--we even pretty much completely stopped having sex (Trust me, not by my choice). 

I was starting to think about the future, and although he made it clear that he really was thinking about marrying me, he wasn't ready to start making plans yet, and I didn't want to wait--the stagnation was getting to me. I wanted to talk about getting a place together once my lease runs out, and he wasn't interested for another 6 months to a year. 

We both had our faults-I was getting admittedly impatient, and he became increasingly distant and critical. We talked about it a lot, but it didn't seem to help. When we argued, I would end up hurt and angry and we wouldn't speak for a day or two, after which he would call and apologize for not appreciating me, and he would be very attentive for a short amount of time before falling back into bad habits. It just got worse and worse.
I think the final red flag for me was when I went out with male friends, he stopped checking up on me. He wasn't a jealous guy, but he's seen me when I'm drunk, so he used to check up on me once or twice every hour, to see if I needed a ride or was staying safe. I went out a few times with one friend (who could be a little predatory when under the influence) and he didn't message me even when the bars were closing. While this itself wasn't a big deal at all, it really made me think about where the relationship was headed. 

I think we both just kind of grew apart, and I called it quits after an argument. After a few days, he contacted me, heartrendingly upset, but I thought it would be best for us to move on. We really do love each other, but I don't think the relationship was going anywhere. 
Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read this, I just needed to let it out.

3. How much interaction do you have with patients? (I'd prefer a job with little to none.)

I have been searching around for internships for the summer and have found very few I am interested in applying for in math (I have found a few more for physics).  I've found a few REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) programs but that's it.  Does anyone have any recommendations of where to find some?

f7um1,1,2011-01-23,Internship Post-Graduation,[deleted],finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/f7um1/internship_postgraduation/,"Background: I graduated last Spring with a Mechanical Engineering, BS, and Economics, AB, degree. I applied to all of the BB programs for full-time positions, and, well, I didn't get a job. The reason that kept coming up was ""lack of experience."" I eventually got a job as a research assistant for an economic (academic) firm. 

Present Day: My job has some qualities that could be seen as experience for a BB i-banking position, but it isn't a typical finance job in the least. This still worries me about my prospects for a full-time offer so I am considering applying for the summer internship program typically aimed at rising college seniors. 

Would anyone recommend applying for one of the summer internships as a post-grad? Would they even consider me?

Thanks!

P.S. Any other suggestions or insights from wiser people on how to get this experience would be like mana from heaven."

I'm sure everyone always gets submissions saying how trees or reddit has made them such a better person and how they love everyone in it. I don't really know any of you so I can't comment on the love part, but I do appreciate the collective mindset of individuals who have such a fresh outlook on life. 

I've never been able to feel more at peace with the world than I do now. I was so trapped in the daily human problems we give ourselves; I know understand and am at peace with how small I really am in this world. It makes me long to be a better person towards my fellow species and all those that make up this great small planet we live on. I don't know without the push towards science and trees reddit gave me if I ever would have explored these topics in my life. It makes me wish my fellow graduate students could understand the complexities and wonders of science. 

I study a lot in graduate school and a lot of my time is consumed by my internship. I guess I just wanted to say, the trees community and reddit, in general, is great. It gives me balance and has made me a better person."

I'd like to find out the details behind other people's situations.  How old were you?  Were you both employed?  Did you break up?  Who signed what?  And so on.  I've never lived with a significant other, but we practically do now.  We'd both be saving a lot of money if we shared a room and we spend so much time together that it seems like a logical next step.  I'm all ears... 

**EDIT:** Some more information about our situation:

* I'm 22, she is 21.  I will be graduating in June and she has one more year until she graduates.
* I'm relying on some heavy student loans to get me through college, plus a part time job.  Her parents still provide complete financial support for her
* We hardly fight, are madly in love, do everything together, spend every night together, cook nearly every meal together, and so on.  We both know each other very well (living habits, cleanliness) and definitely agree that we would make good roommates.
* I moved across the country when I was 19 (without my family), so now my entire life is on the West Coast.  It would probably cost me more to move back East after graduation than to stay out here, especially if I can secure a *decent* job / internship to either put off loan repayment or cover the outrageous monthly bills.  The reduced rent from sharing a room is a major factor.
* We have also mentioned getting a house with some other friends to reduce overall costs.
* Neither of us have a car, but you don't need one where we live.  "

A little background - I have been diagnosed with Anxiety and OCD in the past few years, and those symptoms have generally improved to the point where they do not impact my life. (OCD/Anxiety revolved around cleanliness and germs). In the 2.5 years since I overcame this, I have really pulled my life back together. I greatly improved my grades (to the point where I will graduate with honors) in college, I started working out and lost around 70lbs, and I generally feel better about daily life.

I am set to graduate in the next few months, and I am procrastinating about my future for some reason. I know I could have pushed myself further academically if I did not have OCD, and I could have gotten an internship I wanted or even picked up a minor to go with my major. Now, I am putting off looking for a job, even though I have the qualifications and background to apply for many. At times, I look back in the time period when my OCD was at its worst, and feel like I missed out on a great chunk of my college life (In a social sense and academic sense). I am kind of numb to this now, but I feel like I missed on soo much whenever I was suffering from OCD and anxiety.

In general, I don't want this lack of social life in college to haunt me for years to come. I am starting to feel pulled down by this already, and I just wanted to know if there are any techniques to minimizing this. I don't want to wind up 3 years in the future looking back at all the things I missed out on. The reason being, is that I keep hearing about how hard it is to make new friends after graduating and moving to a new town, and I believe it will be a tad harder for me.

f8kkl,1,2011-01-25,Little help for a CS Undergrad?,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/f8kkl/little_help_for_a_cs_undergrad/,"I'm feeling a little bit down tonight, Reddit, and I'll tell you why. First, an introduction.

I'm a third year CS undergrad at the University of Arizona.  I started working at a department on campus in early 2008 and I've worked there ever since.  Now my job pretty much sucks.  Where most of the departments on campus have a fully staffed IT team, we have 2 part time students to cover everything (Server Administration, Help Desk, Database Administration, everything).

To make it short, I've had to pretty much take up all duties from software development for in-house software to Linux administration to helping everyone that walks through the god damn door.

My goal in life, however, is not to be a Sys Admin for the rest of my life, but to be a software engineer.  I have around a 3.75 major GPA and I have almost no accomplishments of my own, save for a MUD I programmed in my second semester in Java, which is my strongest language. Sure I know some C programming, and I've touched on Python, Prolog, Haskell, Ruby.  I know concepts like UML, Relational Databases, Design Patterns.

I'm at a point where everyone around me is getting internships and jobs at companies like Microsoft and Google.  I just feel like I'm getting left behind.  Every campus job I've applied for to try and break into software engineering has never warranted an interview, much less even a response. I've sent out my resume and applied to all the internships I could possible think of for this upcoming Summer, so I'm hoping for something promising there.

I had an ok gpa, but very extensive co-curriculars including being president of my university's student government.

I had an unrelated summer internship, and started work at my current job the beginning of October.  When I applied for the position, it was listed as a drafter experienced with CAD.  My salary is decent but I ride a 70 minute commute on the train each way.  I don't have any major debts, and for the time being moved in back home so my living costs are negligible. At the interview, I was told I'd also be doing project management which I was fine with.  My company does electrical construction and has about 100 field workers and about 15 office workers.  A few weeks into my job, the woman who does materials purchasing for all the construction sites went on vacation.  I was asked to pick up that work while she was away.  Then my owner fired her while she was on vacation.

Needless to say it just itso-facto became part of my regular job, for no extra compensation.  I also was weaned off doing any CAD work because my owner wanted me to 'focus on project management'.  In general the owner can be unpleasant and sometimes downright mean.  Today as I was leaving I went to say goodnight and the owner yelled at me for somebody else not finishing something that was asked of them before leaving.  The owner finished by saying ""you need me more than I need you.""  Since I started working on October, 3 people have been fired, and the atmosphere in the office is always ten times worse on days the owner is there.

f9mu1,8,2011-01-26,She doesn't respect me,ijustwantrespect,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f9mu1/she_doesnt_respect_me/,"Me M32, her F22.  We've been dating a little over two months.

I'm dating a girl who is one of the most amazing women I've ever dated.  She's smart, funny, cute, and kind.  I feel like after a lifetime of looking for the right woman, I finally found her.

Sometimes I can't stand the way she treats me, though.  It started being a problem two weeks ago when we had made plans for the two of us to go out with my sister and one of my best friends, and she canceled on account of a prior engagement that she had forgotten about when making plans with me.  The next night we made plans to go to dinner and then dancing, and she completely blew off the dinner without telling me because she had errands to run.  When she called I told her it was too late to reschedule dinner for that evening if we still wanted to go dancing, and I guess she could tell I was angry, because when I picked her up a little while later the first thing she said was ""sorry"".  I accepted her apology and we went out and had fun anyway.

That didn't change anything, though.  A couple days later she had invited me to go to dinner with her and friend.  Then it turned into she just wanted to catch up with her friend on her own, but I'd see her after.  The day of, I mentioned what we would do after dinner, and she said ""we'll see"".  By the time she got back, she told me it was too late and she just wanted to be by herself.  I told her I was disappointed, but that didn't change anything.

A couple days after that, we agreed to see each other in the evening after we each did some various errands and other tasks on our own.  When it was getting near the appointed time I said I wanted to lift for about half an hour, so how about she come over in 45 minutes.  She said it would be fun to come watch me lift, so I said she could come over right away in that case.  She stopped responding at that point.  An hour and a half went by, after which I finally gave her a call and she said she decided to take a nap, but she was coming over right away.

I was angry that she didn't even bother to tell me, and when she showed up, I told her I wanted to date someone who would respect my time more than she had been.  I didn't know how to word it so I was standing up for myself without hurting her, but whatever I said it wasn't right; she gathered up her stuff and stormed off to her car, crying.  I talked her out of leaving but it was incredibly stressful.

It was to the point that a couple days later I called her, thinking of breaking it off.  She could tell I wanted a serious discussion and she invited me over to talk about it.  I thought we talked things over, and we wound up having a very fun weekend together.  

Monday of this week, though, we watched what I thought was a very depressing movie together.  It dealt with relationships failing and cheating in relationships, and after watching the movie we got into a serious discussion about some of our past relationships.  I could feel her pulling away from me and it kind of scared me, and I didn't know how to react.  

Yesterday, in fact, she told via IM that she wanted to spend a few days apart.  She wasn't sure how long, but she did make plans with me for this coming weekend.  I told her at first that I didn't like the idea, but that I could try to go along with it.  I couldn't stop thinking about this all day, though, and later in the afternoon I wrote her an IM asking her if she had already made plans for that evening.  When she said she hadn't, I suggested we forget about all the serious conversations and go do something fun in the evening.  She didn't reply for what I thought was a long time (it took almost half an hour for her to finally reply), and I was kind of panicking.  I finally decided to myself this is crap, I didn't deserve to be ignored in the middle of a serious conversation, and I wrote that it wasn't working and I didn't want to date her.  

She wrote back that she wasn't ignoring me (her parents had called) and then called me up to tell me that if I wanted to go do something fun with her that night, we could.  I was somewhat taken aback, but I agreed, since I still hoped we could work it out somehow.  Before we went out anywhere, she wanted to talk about how each of us were feeling, and it turned into a long enough conversation that we didn't have time to do anything other than hang out for a while at a coffeeshop.  It was actually quite pleasant.  When we got back, though, she started telling me it was silly to be upset over not replying for half an hour, silly to be upset over repeated flaking or extreme lateness, and that if I had broken up with her over these reasons it would be the silliest breakup ever.  I told her I felt disrespected in each of these incidents, but that I was sorry for hurting her and that I sincerely hoped we could work it out.

Incidentally, she's been working as an intern and looking for a more permanent job all over the country for the length of our relationship.  I always gave her honest advice about her job search, but I also told her I hoped she would find a job in the area.  It looks like she's going to take a job offer here, at least partly influenced by the fact that I'm here, so I have every reason to believe she thinks the relationship is serious.  She just doesn't respect my time or the way she makes me feel, and I don't know how to talk to her about this without it blowing up in my face.

That's where we stand now.  For the first two months she was the girl of my dreams, but the last two weeks have been a bit of a nightmare.  I even tried to break it off, but at first she ignored my attempt to break it off, and then she started telling me how wrong it was for me to even consider it.

Any suggestions?"
f9mdp,16,2011-01-26,"My sad story, ending in a query",terranphilosopher,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/f9mdp/my_sad_story_ending_in_a_query/,"**The Sad Story:**

In 2006, I lost my job (environmental scientist) due to drug testing (positive for THC metabolites).  I stayed at [0] for ~4 weeks, but I still produced a (barely-)positive result.  In previous cases, this was enough time, but I had put on a few (~15?) pounds, and my fat cells betrayed me.  

I'll add here that I have chronic pain from a ruptured lumbar disc.  I was on prescription meds (Bextra) for it, but then those meds were removed from the market (~2004?) when some troubling side effects came to light.  It turned out that incidence rate of some side effects (damaging heart valves, causing heart attacks &amp; strokes) was covered up/fudged by the manufacturer.  This experience caused me to lose trust in the medical/pharma industry, so from that point on I self-medicated with cannabis, and it worked like a charm.  I did not get a MMJ card, though I understand that my medical condition *may* now qualify me for it.  Now (Jan 2011), I have been without health insurance for ~4 years and have no money for a doctor's visit/MMJ card, so I guess that will have to wait.

I will (try to) refrain from ranting about the injustice of it all - how I was hurting no one, would never mix it with work, gained medical benefit from it, etc...

While working, I was good about saving money, so I had a substantial emergency fund piled up.  For some time (~2 years), I tried unsuccessfully to get another job in the field (environmental science/engineering/consulting), but getting fired for failing to comply with my previous employer's drug policy destroyed my ability to get another job in the field.

I will add here that this is the only job from which I have ever been fired.  Also, before this, I had never failed to get a job for which I interviewed.  Legally, I have never had so much as a speeding (or parking) ticket.

I enjoy life, and don't get too worried about material things (especially money), as long as I have enough to get by.  When I am old and gray, I want to look back and know that I lived my life on my own terms, and that I had as much fun as possible all the way through.  After much contemplation, I realize that I don't want to 'lie' any more - I will no longer seek work in pot-unfriendly fields.  I'll move to Montana and grow dental floss bushes if it comes to that.

Sadly, this country has gone through a bit of a drug-testing revolution/craze in the last 10 years.  An amazing (depressing) proportion of jobs now requires passing a pre-employment drug screen.  My new stance is going to severely limit my job options.

Luckily, I loved the T.A. work I did in grad school (Geology), so I decided to use my scientific knowledge and industry experience for the most honorable job on the planet - teaching.  I have always had it in mind that I might like teaching as a career, and now I had a reason to make the move.  Fast-forward 2 years.  I have recently (August 2010) completed my second Master's degree, this time in Teaching.  My student-teaching internship and WA teaching certification were completed in June &amp; July 2010, respectively. 

I am now looking for work as a teacher in WA state.  In the meantime, I am growing desperate for income to live on.

**The query:**

Does anyone in WA have work for an intelligent, hard-working ent with a couple of Master's degrees?  At this point I am looking for *anything* to live on while I try to find work teaching science.  Pride was left behind many moons ago - **any/all** offers will be considered.  AMA - I may reply in private message depending on the question.

edit: I live in the Seattle area

**TL;DR:**

* Failed drug test, lost job &amp; career, ruined life for 4 years (&amp; counting).  Do not emulate.

* AMA

* Got work?"
f9m5d,10,2011-01-26,How does one go about finding an internship?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/f9m5d/how_does_one_go_about_finding_an_internship/,"I am currently a freshman studying electrical engineering, and I would really like to find an internship over the summer. I would say that I have more experience than most freshmen in engineering, as I am already starting some of the core classes (circuits, signal processing). However, many of the companies I have talked to at job fairs are simply not interested in freshmen (understandable, as they are looking for eventual full time employees). I'd like to think that I have a decent resume (prior research experience, albeit in a different science, high GPA, etc.)

I guess my questions would be:

1. How should I go about approaching companies at job fairs? Is it advisable to mention awards, but add that I haven't had any prior internship / engineering experience outside of coursework?

2. What are my chances of getting an internship as a freshman? I hope in my undergraduate career to get an opportunity to work at both a start-up and a large corporation.

3. What should I put in cover letters if I don't really know which area of EE I'm interested in? I am enjoying signal processing a bit more than circuits at the moment, but I don't know enough about the field to really understand the current technologies and research. Should I mention that I'm open to anything, or try to narrow down my interests?

Thank you very much in advance! If any more information (barring identifying details) would be helpful, I'd be happy to provide it."

f9iqv,1,2011-01-26,"I feel like my mother is being controlling and prone to anger.  Is her behavior atypical, am I a bad son, or is it all in my head?",ButMomIm22,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/f9iqv/i_feel_like_my_mother_is_being_controlling_and/,"Backstory: I'm a 22 year old male, who's spent the past 3 years or so languishing in pretty moderate depression.  I blew my chances at a nice public college, spent a couple failing semesters at community college (my mom insisted I shouldn't drop out or take a gap semester/year ""because I'd be too lazy to find a job""), and just generally had a miserable time.  Anyway, lately I've found I have more energy and capacity to do things, and I'm willing to give college and life in general another shot.

My father passed away when I was around 12 years old, so my mom has raised me most of my adult life on her own.

My mom seems to be great with other people.  She has many friends and is close to many family members, all who seem to think that she's great and that I'm a horrible burden according to her.

For example, my mom's said that family members and friends have suggested that she:

*  Send me out to the Midwest (I live in the Northeast corridor) where I can work as a farmhand/take care of aging relatives/the disabled to learn some discipline so I can stop ruining things for her and my sister.
*  Have me live with my Korean war vet grandfather who would teach me some discipline and how people were expected to live before the hippies ruined everything or something.
*  Join the peace corps/army/navy (to learn some discipline)
*  Sign up for an internship program several states over so that I can... learn some discipline.  That stopped when she saw what the bill for such programs are.  (More than state college)
*  Drop out of community college and give up my dreams of going back to a four year school and ""get a file clerk job like [Harvey Pekar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Pekar),"" so that I quit wasting her money/quit making her anxious about my future.
*  25-30 is the new 21 in this era/economy, and I'm immature for my age, so I shouldn't move out anytime soon.

She says horrible things about me going to college and occasionally having trouble, like that I'm sending my sister with moderate Asperger's to a state institution ""where she'll be raped,"" unless I graduate ASAP, leaving enough cash for my sister to go to college herself (apparently, there is a fine line between living in a state institution and getting a liberal arts degree).

She often brings up that she worked as a state auditor in Missouri when she was 18 and had a free ride to a state college, and that I'm ""just different"" than her, and ""very much like a child.""  She brings up random stuff, like that she was buying her own clothes when she was 16 (but she specifically told me I'd be asking too much if I wanted a car/rides to get a job when I was just getting old enough to work).

She also frequently explodes over small things.  For example, I forgot to start the dishwasher after breakfast this morning, and missed a little splatter of grease on the stove last night (which wiped up in about 3 seconds).  She went off the handle about how I'm disrespectful to this household and could never live on my own.  And how my room smells sometimes when I'm putting off laundry (like I'm the only 22 year old who forgets to do laundry).  And about how people like me, when they live in houses, often the house has to be cleaned by professionals or demolished before the property can even be sold.

She also brings up my dorm room in college a lot.  When I lived in a single and was deeply depressed about 2 1/2 years ago, I made a bit of a mess of my room and didn't bother to use a hamper.  I also had a few coffee grounds on a table next to my coffee maker.  As a result, the room kind of reeked.  I've tried to explain to her that I wasn't the same back then, but she consistently uses this as evidence I can't move out anytime soon or support myself.  She also, oddly enough, brings up that I was a ""manipulative and sarcastic three year old.""

She's also said that if I get a job, I have to start paying rent, and that she won't let me move out to a place that isn't up to her standards.  For example, she doesn't like the apartments in my upscale town, ""because the people who live there might smoke/sell pot/you might get mugged.""  (I'm pretty sure it's just mostly low-income families and single people who can't afford a big house.)  And she doesn't want me moving/lodging in to a suburb in a less expensive area, ""because people aren't nice in most places out here like in the midwest.""  And she has control as she owns the title to my car, so I need to get enough cash for both a car and the downpayment and income stream for an apartment.  Every time I've wanted to leave the house against her will (say to visit my girlfriend, or go to an informal party with friends), she's said she'll call the cops and either say the car was stolen or file a missing person's report.  I know it's probably a bluff, but I don't want to test her.

She's fine around other people, but she seems to get really irritable when it's just me.  The only exception is my girlfriend, who she has issues with due to her atheism and the fact that she, too, has had trouble doing well in college until recently.  She doesn't outright attack my girlfriend, but she gets angry and stuff with me like she normally does when my girlfriend is over.  My girlfriend, who has very laid back parents, thinks my mom has issues.

My mom also tends to say that I'm a ""mentally ill child,"" even though depression is like the common cold of abnormal psychology, and I've recovered much.  I no longer take antidepressants, I get myself out of bed, I cook dinner for the family, and I get my work done on time for school.  I'd say I'm pretty functional for a person who is ""mentally ill.""

Anyway, I've had enough of this, and I'm working hard on raising my grades (depression GPA is a real pain, academic-aspirations-wise), trying to find a job to save up some money, and hopefully in the near future, I can either make enough money that I can get a new place to live, and hopefully either negotiate having her let me take the car (she has her own), or buy one of my own.  Sadly, the economy seems to be dead at the entry level in my town.  People with degrees and more experience than me are competing with me for the same jobs in this economy, after all.  Still, every time my mom and I get into a fight, I feel all the more committed to get a job.  I'm thinking I might try a temp agency at the end of this term, or even try to see if they can offer flexible hours durring this current semester.

I just feel like she's dragging me down with all the anger and negativity, and I want to move on in my life.  Yes, I'll probably make some mistakes living on my own, and maybe I might even have to move back if things really go sour, but I don't think just dealing with this current situation indefinitely is healthy.  I feel like 22 is old enough to start living my own life.

Am I being antiproductive to the household by wanting to leave?  Are these behaviors typical for the higher-strung type of parent?  Am I setting myself up for failure by trying to leave at this point?  Is my frustration at this household ""all in my head"" as my mom says?  Is there anything I can do to make things more endurable while I save up cash to leave?

Anyway, sorry if I sound kind of mopey or frustrated.  I'm just tired of having so many frustrating, demoralizing things happen, and my mom acting like it's good, productive parenting.

**tl;dr:** My mom seems extremely uptight and prone to anger.  Are my suspicions correct?  Is there anything I can do to improve my situation in the short term, while I save up money to move out?"
f9ftz,10,2011-01-26,My SO is considering re-enlisting after a year of failed job hunting...how can I help her?,wanting_to_help,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f9ftz/my_so_is_considering_reenlisting_after_a_year_of/,"She claims she has been job hunting, checking Craigslist every day, putting in applications here and there but I just never see anything come of it; not even so much as an interview. She lucked out and had an unpaid internship at our city hall as an assistant to a higher-up there but once college started back up, she disappeared without saying anything and probably burned that bridge.

She was in the Navy for 3 years as an aeronautical engineer and was honorably discharged for medical reasons but is now considering re-enlisting if they will take her (she had surgery to fix the problem that got her discharged). 

She's been a civilian for 2 years now and from my perspective, I don't really see her making a genuine effort into joining the rest of the working class world. She claims she feels like a ""fish out of water"" and isn't employable without a college degree (which I personally take as her talking herself out of trying / I know most entry-level jobs don't require degrees), however she is absolutely employable and dependable when it comes to things she genuinely wants to do. 

It seems to me that her being 23 y/o, up until this point in her life she has had commanding officers and parents telling her what to do- and she feels that she needs that in order to thrive. When she's left to her own devices, she will be passive, lazy and unmotivated; because she never acts on the things she needs to do, it makes her depressed and the whole cycle starts over.

I've suggested finding a local career center, creating a resume, applying for any and everything that seems like something she can do. After a full year of essentially watching her do nothing with her life, and being presented with her interest in wanting to join the Navy again, I'm bit heart-broken. I love her dearly but I truly don't feel she's exhausted every option and is taking the easy way out in re-enlisting. She's been coasting off of disability checks and hardly making an effort to supplement that income. I end up paying for most of our expenses because I know she can't afford it.

I'm a U2 Computer Engineering student, with an OK GPA (~3.3) and will be interning in a big French IT services firm this summer. 

It's not yet clear which team/department I'll be working with this summer - I am seeing them in February and will be asked what I'd like to do with them. As of now, I'll be entering as a Java/J2EE development intern.

I have two questions:

* Based on my skills (see below) what which domain would I be the most useful in, and how can I prepare for this particular role? 

* Do you have any quality J2EE learning ressources, preferably tailored to what an IT Services firm does?

Skills: the course list [attached](http://imgur.com/jVdq8) and some Python, Matlab, SPICE experience

Cheers, comrades.

PS: Don't hesitate to point out anything that's unclear, or ask for more info.

I'm a fourth year at UCSD that is majoring in political science. Up until recently, I thought I knew what my post college plans were. I'd planned on going to law school, which was why I majored in political science. I had some interest in political science, but I found other subjects like engineering and psychology more interesting. However, I (misguidedly) thought political science would give me an edge for law school admissions. Anyways, now I'm set to graduate this year and have even done well on the LSAT (171) but I've realized I don't want to go to law school anymore. I got an internship working in a law firm, and it's nothing like what I imagined. It's very boring work, and the experiences of the lawyers there that I've talked to have made it clear that I do not want to do that. At the moment I'm feeling very lost. I'm about to graduate with a degree that I feel is now useless. I've always entertained the notion of going to art school, because I've been interested in product design/transportation design since I was a kid. I never pursued this because my parents were adamant that I enter a profession they deemed to be successful: law, medical, etc. Now that I'm about to graduate, I'm wondering if this would be an ideal time to pursue my long lost passion. What do you guys think? I know that it will take a lot of work and be expensive, but the prospect of landing my dream job is worth the risk. Specifically, I'd like to attend Otis or Art Center in Pasadena. If anyone that attends one of these schools or is in the product design/transport design field can chime in I'd really appreciate it.

Some background information: I graduated from a state university last April with a bachelor's in TV/Film production. That summer I worked a post-graduate paid internship, and then a salaried job for a production company until December, when I was laid off. After a month of collecting unemployment and applying to probably over 100+ companies, I am finally getting some offers, these two being the most appealing:

Offer 1: Part-time position at a well-known retail store

Offer 2: Full-time intern at a well-known (within the industry) video/tv company

I would like to take both jobs, but realistically will only be able to choose one because training for both are happening the same days. The retail position pays fairly well, and it would help my social life, because there are dozens of employees (including a few of my friends), not to mention I would be able to take advantage of the employee discount and other perks. The only real con to this job is that it could be somewhat of a dead-end job, in the sense that it won't help further my career in the TV/film industry whatsoever.

The internship is another story. It's an intense 10-month training internship that pays nothing for the first two months, but increases every two months afterwards, so that by the 7th month or so, I'm banking. However, the internship is extremely hands on and in depth and can basically be viewed as graduate school or boot camp for the TV industry, so it would be amazing experience and definitely give me an ""in"" at pretty much any major network or production company. The cons: Obviously, no pay for two months is a cause for concern, but as long as my unemployment keeps coming in, I'll theoretically have enough for gas/living expenses. The internship is basically a competition with other interns for a full-time position within the company after the 10 months, and after all that time, I might not get it and be back where I started (unemployed). It's also about an hour's commute, there and back, every day. The hours are somewhat erratic and long, so that on some nights I wouldn't get home till 8pm or later. My social life would essentially suffer, as I probably won't have the energy/money to do much when I'm not working.

I'm leaning toward the internship, just because it would help me and my future career, but it's a big risk to take. Can anyone offer any insight/suggestions?"

Anyways, I was pursued for a little while by a friend of a friend, not knowing what to do or how to proceed until she basically took the reins and I went along. We were together for two months and spent a lot of time together, sleeping in the same bed more often than not, etc. I really enjoyed the intimacy and was having the time of my life. I felt like it could really go somewhere. Then she ended it, citing that she felt things were getting too serious and that she didn't want to do anything long distance if she got an internship outside of the state over the summer. I respected her decision and have stayed away from her. Our mutual friend has regular Wednesday night parties and I went last night, knowing that she'd be there, but thinking that I could handle it.

I couldn't.

She got there and I became completely introverted and couldn't look anyone in the face. We played a drinking game and she sat two chairs away from me. It killed me. I had to go to the bathroom twice to collect myself. It really destroyed me. Over the Christmas break I thought that I was doing okay, with just the regular amount of being sad, but seeing her again just ripped me to shreds. I feel that the only way to keep a healthy outlook is to avoid her and avoid putting myself into these situations, but that means that I'm leaving a lot of mutual friends behind.

What do I do? Has anyone resolved a conflict like this? Has anyone been in a position where things just went poorly and there was no resolution?

EDIT: Thanks for the advice everybody. I think I just found my spine. Thanks especially to Raider_Grrrl for being blunt. I'm gonna go there next Wednesday and make a terrible fool of myself, just like I used to before we got together. :) And thinking back on the whole issue, I may drink less or just abstain. I don't drink heavily and I don't drink often, so I may have been a little depressed from the alcohol."

TL,DR: New graduate aerospace engineer, not sure what to do with life (can't really find work, more school?).

Hi everyone,

I graduated in April 2010 with a degree in Aerospace Engineering. I had lost interest in the program some time in the middle of my second year, but I was too stubborn to quit or change programs. I still love science and technology, which is why I studied engineering in the first place, but I couldn't see myself doing hardcore engineering for the rest of my life. I wasn't the greatest student, and my lack of interest didn't help in that regard, but I wasn't a bad student either. I graduated with a 3.6/4.0 GPA.

I live in Toronto, and my school isn't very prestigious (it's the other one in Toronto). The job market for engineers, especially aerospace, isn't too hot right now. I still tried despite my lack of interest. I have internship experience, research experience, but I don't know anyone (another story) and I can't seem to get past HR. I've made use of the school's career centre, and people have told me that my resume and cover letters are good. I can't even get a McD's-type job because they know I'll leave as soon as something better comes along (I guess I should take my B.Eng off my resume for these).

So now what little I have saved is dwindling away. I am seriously considering more education, but not in engineering. I am asking you all for suggestions on what I could do or study? Is it possible to work overseas as a new graduate, without going the English teacher route? I just have no idea what to do right now and I'm looking for ideas/inspiration.

Thanks!"

Currently I am in the application process for an internship abroad at a relatively large firm. It's a summer internship and i'm really exciting about it.

I match all the requirements and think i have quite a good shot at being selected as a new intern.

A minor obstacle i am facing right now is that this firm requires an official TOEFL or IELTS certificate of each applicant. I am also not a native speaker of English nor is my current course being taught in this language.

The cheapest test centre close to my place charges the equivalent of $225 which is a lot of money for a student. That and the fact that my English at the moment is not so polished (i will pass the minimum score but this keeps me from scoring high) keeps me from spending this much money on a certificate like this.

I would like to know how easy it is to fake a TOEFL certificate (order online?) and if it is fool-proof. Could the organization contact the organization behind TOEFL and check if my submitted score is legit?

Thanks!

I don't mean that in a masochistic need-pain-to-feel kind of way but in a I have no excuse kind of way. I didn't have some abusive life. I'm not on the verge of starving, or living on the streets or living in a broken home. I'm a white male from an intact home with two educated stable and (relatively) well off parents still together. I have no reason to complain and yet I feel I have everything wrong.

I am depressed, technically closer to dystimic, and have been for basically all my living memory. I learned to cope, to hide, to fake it, but I was almost never happy and certainly never for more than a few days. On top of that I have tremendous anxiety over seemingly everything (at least everything of late). What's more is the either my defenses are coming down or I just can't cope or maybe it's just not being in denial but it has seemingly been getting worse or at best staying perfectly level. 

Years ago It all hit me at once, I was under lots of pressure at college, plus an internship and a horrid roommate and I just collapsed. I could barely get out of bed and I could not think of anything serious for more than about 20 minutes before my anxiety was so intense I physically had to stop. I finally admitted I had a problem that needed dealing with and I started therapy. and I continued, on and off as I could afford it (and as I was in town) for the next two years. I then switched to going twice a day and have to date tried and failed to get a positive reaction from 4 different anti-depressants. Nothing has helped.

Now I am back to living with my parents, in a small town in Canada. Not where I grew up, not where I know another living soul not where there are any job opportunities. I feel like I'm at the end of a line. There is seemingly no way forward. I only moved back right before Christmas and have not started up with yet another new therapist but I just feel like what's the point. I used to think ""any session now, I'll feel better"" but it's like better is that carrot eternally out of reach no matter how hard I run. 

I have always gawked at the thought of suicide. I am an atheist and have no belief that there is any ""after this."" This is it, this life such as it is constitutes the whole of my existence. All the universe, all the world and all its people are only in existence to me so long as I am able to livingly perceive them. In the pas that had always made me regard suicide as an act of lunacy, but my feelings are shifting on the subject and that frightens me as well I'm sure it should. 

Now I think that even if I find some new coping skill, some new and better container for all my wretched dark depression AND find some way to also keep my frazzled anxiety at bay AND find some way to really be able to socially communicate with relative ability AND find  some woman willing to have me deep down I will still have this at the depths of my foundation. a force that is crippling, making me physically hurt and limiting my ability to get myself to do things. This pain I feel, that I have almost always felt, I fear it will always be waiting like some kind of horrid and unwanted dog, forever loyal and forever tormenting. The worst of my is starting to see this and think that perhaps it would be nice to stop doing battle with a seemingly inexhaustible foe. With joyous feelings so utterly fleeting and minor, usually nothing more than the pleasurable responses of biological functions, good food, masturbation (not at the same time of course) maybe just maybe null is better than zero. maybe non-existence is better than near void. 

I am a long time redditor and I think I just feel like despite the diatribe that there is always options when you ask other people. That there may be some obvious thing I'm not seeing. I doubt it. I know i should probably get set up at the clinic and tell a professional all this than a bunch of internet strangers (no offence intended) but guess it just comes down to this. I'm not sure I can be fixed. I wish this was all some traumatic memory, I with this was because I lost my parents as a child, at least then I would have a starting point, a single coordinate from which to begin navigation. But I don't know if I truly think that I can make it back. I miss felling rested, I miss feeling good, I miss thinking that I'm in process, that I'm healing, but years later I see no change. and I'm just so fucking miserable and alone and stressed all the time over nothing. I don't want to be driven to kill myself, I don't feel like I am driving to kill myself but I do feel like I'm tipping in the direction of one day finding that acceptable. 

I may go back and lie down for a while so if you don't hear back right away it's probably just that. And if you read this far, I hope it wasn't to rambling and thanks for reading.

I have been an intern at Symantec for about 5 months now, and I am still copy pasting file names off of DvDs onto a spread sheet. I have yet to learn ANY programming from them, so I am taking matters into my own hands and teaching myself.

So my questions are:

If anybody is apart of the Artificial Intelligence community, is there any advice that you think I should have?

What language should I start with? 

How did you learn to program?

Is there anything that you wish you knew when you first started programming?"

backstory so I'll get right to the point.

I went to Church with my family last Sunday. I went with my step-dad,
his girlfriend, and my brother, who was adopted by my birth mom 
before she passed away.

Well, we are a odd family anyways.

The minister is halfway through a direct quote, ""... comes great 
responsibility,"" when an old man in front of me starts hacking, 
coughing, and the choking. He falls down on the bench gasping. 
Luckily he coughs up the impeding object (a tooth from his dentures
lol) before any serious damage is done.

The minister praises God and we all go about our business of prayer,
interrupted only once more by the medics who were responding to a 
911 call. Turns out one of the medics was my aunt, my dead mother's 
sister. 

Now, I had not seen her since the funeral about 10 years ago.
I remembered her afro perm and was happy to see she got it cut,
whether the reason was for work, I don't know, because before I could
talk to her, my step-dad's girlfriend starts acting like a royal bitch.
I never see her this way, and I can't be too sure what caused her
reaction. My brother gets upset too, and me and my step-dad have to
straighten things out.

Fastforward to last night.

I am with my girlfriend, who is much more honest with her feelings
than my step-dad's girlfriend, and I tell her about last week. She 
tells me that I should forget about it and focus on the problem at
hand. You see, I am an intern for a research lab that does
experiments with uppers on lab mice. Last month I stole some mice
and drugs.

Well, I used to keep the drugs in my car, and I'd keep the mice as
pets. Every so often I bring the mice with me to show my friends and
stuff. Sometimes they get loose. Sometimes they get loose on uppers.
Sometimes they get loose on uppers while carrying uppers along with 
them.

Last week when the old man was choking, I thought it was on my shit.
I freaked out. While my dad was trying to help my aunt and his 
girlfriend, I was at my car counting and recounting all the mice and
pills. Needless to say I sampled one or two while making a note to
add it to the final total. When I was satisfied that everything was
accounted for, I took a mouse and left it in the Church before 
going home. I resolved to keep all the contra in my apartment so that
this sort of thing doesn't happen again.

My girlfriend tells me that I can't keep the contra at my apartment
anymore. Well fuck, I say, where am I going to keep this shit? I 
don't know, she says, but I can't stand living with mice running all
over the floor, and, no, don't say you'll use cages. I know you hate
those things.

It's true.

So I bargain, and, Reddit, this is where I need your help. I say, if
I get rid of the contra, can we have anal sex? She has always said 
no to me before.

I hid the loot (in the Church lols) and we did it.

Reddit, if I drive around with my e-brake on, does it wear only the
e-brake pads? Or should I get someone to look at it?

TL;DR
Got anal sex, but not sure about my brakes. "

I ended up getting a gig with a staffing company right after graduation/the end of my internship and have been employed with them since. The staffing company started me off with a 6 month contract as a data analyst for a medium sized buisness. This contract was terminated as of today. This is the first time I have been through anything like this, and my mojo is not working at the moment. I made it alittle more than 3/6 months before getting chopped. This company essentially hired me (a freshly recent grad with little buisness work experience) to control an entire help desk system by my self in the middle of their crisis with little to no assisstance/training. I was starting to get overwelmed but not really at an alarming rate that set off triggers with the other employees/higher ups. Well three months in, it finally caught up to me. I got a call after work today (Friday) from my staffing agency recruiter saying that my contract has been terminated and to update my resume this weekend. She also said that we will be in contact on Monday morning to find new opportunities and to not take this negatively. I do have some money saved up, so that's not really the issue - I need advice.

Apartment workout hints/tips?,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/faixc/finances_say_the_gym_is_no_longer_an_option/,"So this is my second thread in as many days (thanks to those who gave me food advice). I'm serious about trying to get my sorry ass in shape, but have come to realize today that between being unemployed for several months, plus with what is effectively and unpaid internship for the next several months, I will no longer be able to afford a gym membership. There is a decent chance I will be unemployed beyond the internship, so maintaining my gym membership simply may not be a viable option. To be honest, it's been stretching my finances already since it was a join-and-forget-about-it thing from awhile back. Additionally, the job will require me to put in work from home, so I can't really afford the 20-minute-each-way commute to a serviceable gym in terms of time.

I'm looking to maintain a workout, but have the unfortunate problem of living in a second-floor apartment. I do not have space for a squat rack or anything in the apartment, though I DO have a basement storage-room that I may be able to clean up enough to be a workout space.

Effectively, what I'm asking is: What is there that a broke-ass grad student can do at home to get a decent workout in? I can afford to spend $100-150, on some equipment. I have a couple of adjustable-weight dumbbells, and that's about it. 

I have read about the ""convict workout"", but that and anything that involves jumping/quick position changes would probably piss off my downstairs neighbors pretty quickly. There is also not much room for swinging around a bar for squats... so, I'm in a tough position.

I really want to work out/be able to work out. I live in a safe enough neighborhood that I COULD go out for a run, though the sidewalks are pretty fucked up (hello, winter), and accept that I'll look like a giant dork since I run funny. Biking outside isn't an option because the streets have narrowed dangerously this winter due to the massive amount of snow we have.


TL;DR: Gym membership no longer an option, live in a 2nd floor apartment with no extra space (storage room in basement). Budget $150. What can I do to work out at home without pissing off my neighbors?

He told me that he would get back to me in 2 weeks ""either way"" after he finished his interviews.

I emailed him after the 2 weeks basically asking what's going on. He told me he is still conducting interviews.

I desperately want this job. It's the best thing I'm going to find right now. I am assuming that he doesn't want me for the position based on the fact that he was seemingly desperate, yet so much time has gone by. They continue to update / tweak the job posting online. 

I was thinking I could send him a nice quarter page email basically telling him that I am extremely excited about this position and I think that it is a perfect fit for me. I was even thinking about going as far as to offer something like working for free for a month (sort of like an intern?) just to prove myself to him. 

Will this make me look desperate and hurt me? Will it help me? Advice is much appreciated. Thanks!!

He's been torn between med school, grad school, or becoming a teacher or working in a lab.

Let me clarify: I could give a fuck which one he chooses. I would love him if he were a janitor. 

The problem is that he refuses to intern, apply for scholarships/loans, seek a mentor, or do any of those extra-curriculars which are generally sorta-kinda-helpful when trying to get into med or grad school.

When I talk to him about it he completely shuts down. Since we're now in our twenties both his mom and my mom are breathing down my back about how he's going to support me (1920's anyone?) if he doesn't get going on a career path.

As antiquated as it is--there is some truth to this and it's been keeping me up at night.

I've found several opportunities for internships and scholarships that I've brought to his attention. He has declined to consider any of them.

We finally had a blow out fight today where he said that it was not even any of my business what he did with his career.

To which I replied...""uh..If you plan on being with me it sort of fucking is.""

And it is. Because you know what? I don't actually want to live with my parents forever, and neither does he. But we can't move in together unless we both are on some sort of career path. And I think the least he can fucking do is keep me UPDATED on his general idea instead of leaving me in the complete dark.

I told him all of this and he ended up giving me a vague outline of his current ideas, which I thanked him for. But I know this conversation isn't over.

Am I being a complete bitch? Or am I doing the right thing by trying to guide him towards a decision?

Edit: We've been together going on four years now.

I am a maths student and i want to apply for an internship at ICAP(inter-dealer money broker). Firstly, I am not sure whether i can submit an application for both Business Services and Broking. I'd like to do this to increase my chances and because im not sure which one i want to do more.

Secondly, I am quite ignorant when it comes to business. However, i want to educate myself by reading books on business and finances. Could anyone tell me what are the skills needed and qualifications needed to become a broker or to work in Business services.

Lastly, Could you give me an idea of what would be my average day if i was to get the internship.

Tl;dr Applying for an internship need some info

What can I do?",cakenbacon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/faduj/reddit_im_losing_my_job_getting_kicked_out_and_im/,"I'm 22 years old and I've worked as a pastry chef for close to two years. I interned at this place for school and when my internship ended they hired me on for a full time pastry chef position. As I was getting ready to leave work on Tuesday two of my supervisors told me they found out that I (along with many others) am being laid off on Friday. They're close friends, so they were very upset about it, and told me if I wanted to leave now they would understand it and would be more than happy to act as references for my time at the company. I declined, partly from shock and partly because I didn't want to lose out on unemployment benefits, and said I would work the rest of the week.

Recently I moved in with my boyfriend at his parent's home, we share a room together and I pay monthly rent to his mother. I didn't decide to move in because of finances, I moved in because we saw so little of each other that I was afraid of the relationship failing.

When I got home, I told my boyfriend what happened and we sat down together with his mother to tell her what was going on. Her first reaction was to tell me to get my things together and move back in with my parents and I'm completely devastated that her biggest concern was the fact that I might miss rent. I paid nearly $2000 on furniture for the move, which may not sound like much but for me it was a huge expense, and now I don't know what to do about the furniture. If I take it with me, my boyfriend will have nothing but a set of shelves and a free-standing closet. But if I leave it here, I'll have spent $2000 for him to have a nicely furnished room.

Last week I got a used car, my previous car was totaled in an accident that sent me to the hospital and made me miss work. My finances are already tight but I was just making it and starting to get back on my feet. I'll get less than $150 a week on unemployment and I've never written a resume in my life. And I've got to get all of my things back to my parent's house by this weekend. I'm in shock, I'm extremely upset, and I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do besides cry and eat nutella straight from the jar.

tl;dr: Basically within a couple of weeks my life has been turned completely upside down and I have absolutely no idea what to do.

I'm sorry if I've rambled at all, I'm having trouble thinking straight these last couple of days."

fbguh,1,2011-01-29,"Funny story that includes goats, a wedding, and an awkward living situation.",[deleted],WTF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/fbguh/funny_story_that_includes_goats_a_wedding_and_an/,"So, I just got back from the bar with my co-worker and a former intern. While I was there my co-worker told me the BEST story I think I've ever heard. I'm a little drunk so I'll try to retell it as best as possible:

So, my co-worker knows someone that used to live with a bunch of people who owned this place in Arlington, VA [I won't say how he knows the guy for privacy reasons]. The house they lived in had a reasonably large front yard. They hated mowing the lawn so in an attempt to do away with this chore they decided to buy two goats to eat the grass on the lawn (side story: the goats ended up eating everything else except the grass. i.e. flowers, plants, bushes etc.). They kept the goats as pets anyway.

One of the housemates had been dating this girl for almost 10 years. They were madly in love and he finally popped the question. She said yes, and they were engaged. They settled on a house and paid for it but they were waiting to move in until after the wedding. The wedding was in California (home of the bride) and they flew out there one weekend to make the proper preparations. 

On one of their last errands they were picking out flowers and apparently the guy just had a melt down. He got freaked out by the wedding, cold feet, whatever you want to call it. He leaves his fiance standing there in the flower shop. For some reason he decides to go back to Virginia. Instead of flying, he rents a car and decides to cross-country it all the way home. On the way he stops in Las Vegas. He proceeds to blow everything he's worth on gambling, drugs, and hookers over the course of 5 days. 

Defeated and broke he decides to go home. He jumps in his car and starts heading home. On his way out of town he stops at one last strip club and meets a Filipino stripper/hooker. They spent the next couple nights together and he decides that he's in love with her. The ""picture-perfect couple"" starts driving back together and somehow decide to get married. So the guy calls up his buddies back home and has them arrange a wedding in their back yard. Left up to a few 20-something bros, these guys throw together the most ridiculous wedding ever. Provisions included chicken wings and two kegs of beer. 

The couple gets back and they have the marriage. The person that marries them is one of his buddies who spent a day getting an online certification for legal purposes. The wedding comprises of no family, only friends, and the person that walks the bride down the aisle is the dad of one of the housemates (apparently just because he's an old guy and it looks better to have an old guy walk the bride then some young bro). And here's the kicker, the ring-bearer was......wait for it.......one the two goats. I shit you not. They tied the rings to the goat's beard and led it down the fucking aisle. All the while this guy is lighting off fireworks in the background. 

But it's not done....

The house that the guy and the previous fiance had purchased before the break-up was still an issue. They had bought it together equally and neither of them would give it up. So the THREE of them ended up living in the same house for a while. Apparently the guy would intentionally leave the door open whilst banging his filipino-hooker-wife just so his ex would feel more incentive to move out. 

TL;DR - a guy dumps his fiance of whom he dated for nearly 10 years, looses all his money in Vegas, meets a filipino hooker and marries her with his pet goat as the ring bearer in just over 2 weeks.

I know what you're thinking. *Sounds Fake*. I didn't believe it either until my coworker whooped out his phone and pulled up the video of the wedding: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQVWHsIqlOc&amp;feature=player_embedded

THE END

p.s. Don't really know what happened after that. 
p.p.s. They eventually had to get rid of the goats due to some statute in Arlington banning livestock. "

I actually don't know what to put for my desired salary. I graduated in June 2010 with a BS in chemistry and I have no research or internship experience. I did run a search on how much environmental technicians make and they were mostly in the 55K-60K range (which I am pretty sure I won't make as an entry level worker). The job listing did mention that this is an entry level position and I don't need experience whatsoever. With that said, how much do you think I should put for desired salary?

So I'm completing an EE degree in a year or so and will be entering the profession soon. For most of the part, I'm a very desirable candidate for employment. I'm a hard worker, I have a good GPA, I'm experienced, and I have a lot of natural talent related to engineering. 

But I also like to smoke pot. *Oh Noes!!*

I'm wondering how ubiquitous drug testing is in engineering careers. I also would like to know if many companies drug test their engineering interns, as an internship is in my near future. Most importantly, how many do hair tests? I can pass a pee test easily, but a hair test is another story entirely. Of course, a company that does hair tests needs to have its priorities checked and probably isn't worth working for anyway.

I'm also interested in hearing people's experiences on this topic.

I would like to be able to continue casually smoking for the rest of my life, but I obviously am willing to forgo this habit for the sake of my career if that is what it must come to. Call me a sell-out, but it's the responsible thing to do, especially if I ever hope to raise a family. 

Note to haters: I'm not here for your opinions about my ""abuse."" I'm here for the legitimate concern of whether or not one of my hobbies might pose a threat to my career. I'm a responsible user and I don't let it get in the way of my real life obligations. So if you're here to judge my love of cannabis, suck it. If you've ever had a drop of alcohol or a drag from a cigarette, you'd be hypocritical to criticize me for smoking pot anyway, as these are, beyond any shadow of doubt, considerably more harmful than cannabis. And honestly, I've had *legal* habits that are much more harmful to my overall well-being than marijuana, including but not limited to alcohol and World of Warcraft."

I don't get invited to hang out with them or do something together, so I don't really know if really are my friends. I guess not. I've tried doing the usual things on campus.

fbotw,2,2011-01-30,At what point do I give up?,Oderint,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fbotw/at_what_point_do_i_give_up/,"I'll try and keep this brief with short, to-the-point statements.

1. Met a girl sophomore year of college. Started dating. Fell in love.
2. She went away for an internship. Broke up with me while there. There wasn't another guy, she just thought we weren't meant to be.
3. She comes back my junior year. I'm not over her. We talk. Eventually get back together. Relationship is ten times better this time around.
4. She goes off to another internship somewhere else. Comes back and breaks up with me. Break up is 100x worse than first time.
5. This time is so much worse than the first time. But we talk about it again and find out what we did wrong. Problem is she's about to go out of the country for six months so it doesn't make sense to get back together.
6. First few months she's there we talk like young honeymooners. Since Thanksgiving she's gotten cold.

Basically I love this girl. She's someone I can see myself marrying. We've been talking and it seems to me that she has forgotten what we talked about before she left the country. When we were together she would never tell me any problems she had with the relationship, then those problems would build, overwhelm her, and she'd break up with, all the while I thought everything was peachy because I can't read minds. Before she left she told me that she wanted to try again when she got back.  But as time goes on she gets colder.  I don't want to let her go, but something tells me I'm fighting a losing battle. I haven't given up because every time she's come back from being away we hit it off again and everything's great. I'm convinced she's just misinterpreting her feelings, but I don't know if that's the case, and if it is, I don't know how to explain that to her.

I've been honest with her. It sucks too because she doesn't get a lot of internet access over there and she works so much which makes calling hard to do sometimes too. I think that this lack of contact is making matters worse.

Is there some point I give up and stop trying to keep this girl? I'm not in any way confining her or asking her to do anything she doesn't want to do, but we've both said how happy we make the other person and I think it's fucking stupid that she is falling for the same mind-trap she fell for twice before.

Edit 2: Two more comments: 

1. We dated eight months the first time, five months the second time.
2. Even though we're both ""single"" while she's out of the country. On October 19th, which would have been our anniversary had we stayed together she wrote me (paraphrasing): *Happy Anniversary!! Can I still say that? If so then happy anniversary!! :) :)*

ALSO ON A SIDE NOTE: Is it normal for a person's feeling of love to fade a bit while separated from the person they love? I think it's the honeymoon effect which naturally dissolves into the next stage (whatever they call it). Where the hot fires of new romance fade a bit. I've also felt she takes this natural course of relationships to mean that we weren't right for each other.

Edit: 
tl;dr: Should you ever give up on a girl you truly love?
So much for keeping it brief.

Edit #3, UPDATE: I had sent her a letter trying to fix things, then after posting this and getting your responses, thinking about it and talking to some friends of mine, I decided to take all of your advice. I sent her a letter explaining that, while I still stand by what I said, I was throwing in the towel.  I told her I'm tired of making it a priority when she obviously isn't and how I realized that in this point in her life she doesn't want a relationship (via information I didn't give in my OP).  I got a call from her (missed it because of practice). In her voicemail she sounded...stoic. She wasn't sad, but she wasn't happy. I can only describe it as she was relieved I came to this realization, even though the whole thing didn't make her happy either.  I'll be keeping a small hope that in a few years when she's a bit more settled and myself as well, maybe something can happen, but as of right now I'm not going to worry about it.

Thanks for all your help Reddit."

I know he has feelings for me, says stuff at parties when drunk (about how he would love to have my lips on his cock) etc. I confront him, tell him it is unacceptable, we don't speak for a while but then work it out. 

One night he comes over (Beginning of December) and we are cooking and getting ready to watch ""Its Always Sunny"" and playing Battleshots. I drink way too much, pass out on my couch. He takes me up into my bedroom which I remember. I guess he decided to join me (he had an invitation to stay on my couch downstairs). I briefly wake up at one point and he is masturbating in my bed. I am confused and pass out again. Next time I wake up my underwear and pants are off, I am laying face down and he is trying to penetrate me. I can feel him rubbing on me and it takes me a while to realize what is going on and when I do, I throw myself off my bed and ask him wtf is going on and why my clothes are off. He throws my pants at me and curses at me saying I wanted it and leaves. I call 2 close friends in my cohort and they don't understand what I am saying so they come over. I guess I was hysterical for hours. They finally calm me down, call the cops. I go to the station they collect evidence. I do a pretext phone call. After a few weeks they call me and say they can't do anything. It was his word versus mine. He admitted to doing what he did, but said I was awake and consenting. I was not. I am under 25, have dated one person in 10 years, have kissed only 3 people in 10 years and am generally uncomfortable with affection. He said I had grabbed his butt, came on to him sexually and kept kissing him. So the police can do nothing.

School:
We are in the same cohort at school. He starts telling people what happened and that I wanted it. I go to the head of the department and tell her. She hooks me up with the sexual assault organization on campus. The girl working there is my age and great. She helps me to get him removed from my classes, and some other things set up. They try to see if they can do anything to kick him out (he has also cheated for his ex who is in the program, drinks and drives, is extremely inappropriate when drinking. ) So she, along with the department head and assoc. dean of student services see if they can do anything. They won't kick him out but I was notified he will receive some slaps on the wrists. He signed a waiver that would let me know, but I assume since he signed and is ok with letting me know, they are not that bad.

Now:
So, everyone in the program knows I was sexually assaulted. Awkward. Most of the faculty know. Super Awkward. I am angry that he gets to go on and work with people, including young adolescent females. I have to see him multiple times per week and I become hysterical when I see him. His ex supports him and is also in all of my classes and it makes me angry to sit there knowing he cheated for her and that she doesn't deserve her degree and thinks I am full of shit. I am being treated differently by students and faculty and I hate it. I hate not having my normalcy and being kind of in the background. I come home from school so anxious and depressed. 

I have been considering suicide. I am seeing the person who runs the sexual assault program on campus. I am also seeing someone who specializes in this outside of school. Still on 2 different meds for depression and anxiety. But, I am feeling done. I have my plan. Both therapists know this. But, I have not set a date or anything. I have been just trying to keep on keeping on. Yet, everyday it seems less worth it. I get sick thinking about going to classes everyday. I will be done with classes by June and I can move away for internship. I do not think I can make it until then. This whole incident makes me hate how the world works. One of my therapists made me contract for safety till Monday. I had all intentions of complying. One of the conditions was that I go see if a med change would help yesterday (Friday). So I go, and the receptionist brings me into this office and I see my therapist there, a cop, and a Dr. and thing oh, fucking shit. I know what this is since I work in the field. So they are ready to hospitalize me at that point because a friend had told the head of our department I was going to kill myself on Monday, and she called my therapist and they set up that little party for me. I convince them that I am not an immediate threat after about an hour and a half. I am still very much suicidal, but I have things I would need to take care of first and I have not had the chance to do those yet. So, I leave the state after that happens because I am angry and go up to some hot springs and just try to escape for a bit. That leads me to today. I don't know what to do. I would very much like to die. I am just tired, don't like how the world functions and just kind of done. My obligations are still keeping me here for now.

So:
Don't tell me to let Bob take away anymore than he has from me, or I will punch you.
Don't tell me there are so many people that would be hurt from me doing this.
Don't tell me that I have so much to live for and I am so young and just depressed and need to find better meds and work more at therapy.
Don't tell me that I have nothing to be mad about with them ambushing me to take me in and that it is the law (because I know.)

I am scared to go to school for being ambushed again. I have a meeting Monday morning in which I am on a committee to pick a new faculty member. Two of the 5 faculty know about this whole ordeal this weekend and I honestly do not want to go. Part of my contract was to also go see my therapist Monday after school, but I emailed her and told her that I was not going to be coming because I was holding up my end and she no longer has my trust. 


So this post is a mess. Kind of like me. I don't know what I am looking for, what I want, or the point of doing this. "

fckbf,1,2011-01-31,I need some job advice!,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fckbf/i_need_some_job_advice/,"I'm in my last semester of college. I am a business major with a minor in Information Technology. I'm really interested in getting a job in the IT field. I've applied to a ton of jobs but I've only had 1 interview. It hasn't been too long so hopefully some other jobs will request interviews. 

I'm most likely going to get a job offer from the small IT firm I interviewed with. The problem is that the starting salary is only 35k. I'm being told that they give out yearly bonuses and that I would move to 40k after a 1 year trial period. 

The problem is that I've interned at a F500 company, and they paid me about $16 an hour. I feel that I deserve a larger salary as a graduate. If my internship was a full-time salaried position, I would start at 50k - 55k as a consultant with no benefits. They were planning on hiring me upon graduation, but they ended up hiring interns who graduated and could start immediately. 

My first choice is to work for the F500, but they don't have a job for me. Should I try to get back in at the F500 as an intern after graduation or accept the actual job offer. As an intern, I'll make $16 an hour again. I'd hope to get a full-time position after in the department, or have them place me somewhere else in the company.

The company offering the job is tiny, and the interviewer asked several questions regarding if I'd stay in the area and work for there long term. He made it a point to tell me that it hurts the company when individuals quit within a year.

Should I accept the IT position for 35k and use it as a backup if nothing else works out?"

I was wondering if anyone would be able to recommend any companies that do summer placements or internships for chemical engineering students. If anyone has previous experience with a company or specific area that would be great to get a bit of insight to what it might involve.

I'm currently reviewing the resume that I am going to be submitting. I know Blizzard absolutely DESPISES private servers, but I have included it in my resume because truth be told, it has been one of the best learning experiences I have ever had in terms of game mechanic design, development as well as other things. It is also worth noting that the private server I have worked on is not WoW or anything Blizzard related, it is an old game with plenty of private servers and it has been a mere hobby (not paid or anything, no revenue just occasional voluntary donations to keep it going from some kind players). Would it be a good idea to include this experience in my resume or should I hide it in case they take a negative stance and somehow get me into big trouble?"
fcako,12,2011-01-31,"Not ""good enough"" for my bf? (details inside)",throw000away,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fcako/not_good_enough_for_my_bf_details_inside/,"This is going to be a very long post, I just really need a second opinion and to vent a little, sorry about that. 

Me and my bf are both in our mid twenties. Everything is pretty much fine apart from one this: I feel like a loser next to him and his friends. He comes from a wealthy family, has studied in one of the top universities and so has pretty much all of his friends and siblings. His parents have been very attentive and he has been living in a very stimulating environment with museum visits, extra courses such as book circles, music lessons etc. As have majority  of his friends. As a consequence he's very well educated and can have a fluent discussion about pretty much ever subject in the world.

Me, I come from a unknown family and even though we were doing ok economically, socially my childhood was pretty much a disaster with a violent father who were an addict (alcohol and drugs). So everyday I would listen to what was going on at home, interrupt my parents if the fights got physical and figured out when it was time to flee or call the police. It doesn't sound that heavy, but it took A LOT OF ENERGY from me.

I was among top students in my class but no one ever encouraged me or told me I could be something. Since I was restless and not the quietest girl I wasn't a favorite in the class either. Mostly I was just too tired to really care about anything. I had no ambitions above from getting away from home as soon as possible and not ending up like my parents. If I just had had the energy I would have learned a lot more and my grades would have been even better and maybe I would have believed in myself. The interest was there! I remember thinking that if everything just was calm I would love to know more about this and that.

After high school I went to a University and graduated among top 5%. I was very happy about that and even happier when I got accepted to graduate school (PhD). And there I meet my current boyfriend. 

Next to him I feel insignificant. I haven't seen the world like he has, I haven't had time and energy to read all the classics he and his friends have, I didn't go to MIT or Oxford, I don't play a musical instrument, I know nothing about wine... My parents aren't professors, they don't work for google or have successful companies. While they did fancy internships or traveled around the world during term breaks I was working my arse off at Burger King or such just to get money for my studies. They have the self esteem of children who grew up with parents who told them they are intelligent, beautiful and creative...

It's not him as much as it's me. When we started dating I had no such problems. He didn't know who I was and I thought this wouldn't last long. I was flattered by how he thought I was cool, smart and funny. But now... when it's getting serious that has changed to the extent that I'm considering leaving him even if I still love him.

I know it's stupid, but I just can't help it. I keep on wondering why he's with me when he could be with a truly great person. And when I'm with him I wish I had a nice, normal home, that I had been more ambitious, I regret for applying to a mediocre university instead for a really good one. I regret for not even trying to get some good, appreciated jobs next to my studies. I regret that I didn't have the guts to become an exchange student... I just wish I had cared about my future when I was young. And above all I wish I hadn't told him the ugly truth about my family.

TL;DR My boyfriend is as perfect as one can be; nice personality, very good education and a nice, wealthy family. I have pretty average education and a problematic (violence) family. We are together and I feel inadequate next to him, which is why I'm considering ending the relationship.

EDIT: Thank you for such kind and encouraging words. I'm pretty much reading them with tears in my eyes! Thank you so much!

EDIT2: I know the self-pity part is horrible and I don't really like it in myself - yet I just can't let go of the bothering thought about how I've could have learned more, I could have gotten better grades. The ridiculous thing is that even though I was good in school I only got about an average mark on a nation wide test all high school students do before admission to university.

And as many of you noted I am incapable of valuing myself. I do a hell of a good job pretending I do, though. Ironically, one of the things my bf says he likes about me is that I'm such a stable girl who doesn't have that many insecurity issues. We've talked a little about how I feel but I'm not really comfortable sharing that since I'm afraid that would just make things worse. Most of the time I just forbid these thoughts but a practical tips on how to get rid of them would be nice. Maybe I really should go for a little therapy.

I have my first this week, and I'm not sure what to wear. 

I'm applying for engineering jobs, and last year I went with a shirt and tie, dress pants and dress shoes. No job offers, six interviews. I wanted to update my dress, and try and put on a better image. 

What does MFA recommend? I tend to think that full suits can be a bit much, and I dislike being far more over dressed than my interviewers, who were often in company polos (for men), or semi-casual business attire (for women). 

I was considering maybe a shirt and tie with a sweater of some kind over top? 

I'm 6'2-3"", 240 but broad shouldered. Feel free to cut my current styling to shreds, but [here I am.](http://imgur.com/fztH4)

Shirts I wore last year were something like the slim fit striped ones [here.](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/category.do?cid=15043)

Thanks for any advice."

I know I'm just starting out in the career world, but I've already been through retail, and I know for sure that I am just NOT cut out for a salesperson type job. I like people, but I hate playing coy to win them over. I just started this internship a month ago, and I'm already itching to leave.

I know it's a great investment for my future and blah blah blah, but I'm not happy. Then again, it could be because I'm just afraid of taking responsibility. I still live with my parents, so all my basic necessities are pretty much covered, but I want to prove to my parents that I can self-sustain, so they trust me and my decision-making when I finally decide to fly the coop."
