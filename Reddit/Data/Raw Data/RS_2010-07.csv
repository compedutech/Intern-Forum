I'm currently a student doing an internship in New York City, and since the city is a land of beautiful women I'm also using this opportunity to learn to meet them. I've only been doing this for a few days and already am getting incredible responses however as soon as any woman asks what I do, my response elicits huge IOD's.

I understand that the idea of an intern is a big DLV but the reality of my internship is a huge DHV. My internship is actually an incredible opportunity, my uncle is partner in his company making over 500k a year even during the recession and I am basically being groomed to get his job when he retires in 10 or so years. 

How do I get this message across without making it too obvious? Should I even admit to being an intern and just pretend I work there? (I really would prefer not to use this option because lying a lot makes me feel guilty which drops my confidence) Any ideas would be much appreciated."

I'm in NYC for an internship this summer which will in theory, lead to a job this fall. My girlfriend is moving out here this fall once she's finished with summer classes. But, before then, she's coming out here for a weekend to visit. I've only lived here a month and I'm still getting to know the city, so what are some fun/romantic things to do other than the obvious, IE go to a Broadway play.

Because I just graduated (and I'm working an unpaid internship along with a part time job), funds are pretty low. I know there's a bunch of stuff to do in the city in the summer for free, I'd just love some guidance.

Right now, I've reserved us a nice hotel hotel in Manhattan (for a sweet deal, thanks Priceline!) but that's all I've got. Any suggestions?

TL;DR Girlfriend coming to New York City to visit, help me plan a date night.

Thanks!

Born in Mission Viejo, family moved away when I was 2-ish. Raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. Went to school here, and just graduated with a design degree from University of Cincinnati. I had an internship in Hollywood last winter doing online marketing for movies/tv/video games.

I got a job offer from the same company, and am making my return to being a SoCal resident since I was 2. In the 3 months I spent out there for my last internship, I only made 3 real friends, and some other acquaintances. My co-workers are cool, but it's good to get away from the office alot.

Basically, I don't want to get out there without really knowing anyone. I did that last time, and it's not fun. I'm on a start with those few people, but figure hey, the LA Sub-reddit seems to have some great people. So hey there, who wants to go to Disneyland? I love Disney parks.

EDIT: I will be doing Twitter updates about my road trip from Cincinnati to Los Angeles. Twitter.com/FunkyHenryGale. Foursquare updates, and photos from the drive."

He brought this up a while ago when I was really getting clingy, and he even said I made a lot of progress since then, but I don't know.

I know I'm supposed to move on now, or at least move on long enough to ""find myself"" or whatever, but I just feel so lost and confused.  No one's ever broken up with me before, so I've never felt this feeling of helplessness.  I didn't have any problems with him, he just had problems with me, which makes me feel so worthless and retarded knowing I was solely responsible for the demise of the relationship ... that's probably not true, but it just feels that way.

I'm interning in a different city for the summer than most of my friends, so it's not like I can hang out with them every day, and they're really not the comforting type anyway ... mostly guys, and we don't really have a talk-things-out kind of friendship.

I don't know.  I feel stupid for letting this relationship go sour and not realizing when I was messing up.  I don't know how to get over him.  And he's all I can think about, and I can't concentrate at my internship or anything.  I don't know how to deal with this kind of thing.

But I recently graduated from college, doing an internship right now. I saw my ex (I'm not entirely sure what to call her.

I sent her a message, congratulating her on her work and asked what she was up to but she's still ignoring me (you'd think she'd start talking to me after 2 years but I guess not). 

This has caused me to reflect on my BYU experience. It definitely wasn't the normal experience, not even for BYU. I find myself wishing that things had gone differently with her. I was a huge loser when it came to dating, still am. But I prayed for someone and she showed up. If she hadn't left me a month after meeting me, if we were still together, I'd still be an extremely strong and faithful member. A part of me wishes for the chance to go back in time and fix things, to make it better. I think I'd be happier living a lie with someone else than knowing the truth alone.

cm1rk,2,2010-07-05,Dear Reddit: I just found out that this sweet unpaid internship I got this summer might actually be illegal slave labor. What should I do?,Overdrive_Ostrich,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cm1rk/dear_reddit_i_just_found_out_that_this_sweet/,"I recently got this internship at a local arts&amp;culture weekly newspaper. My task is to sort through the press releases their office receives each week, organize them, and write an events calendar for their weekly publication. This internship is unpaid and usually has me working about 15-20 hours a week independently at my work station. It's a lot of fun - I get to be pretty creative in summarizing these events across town - but it is pretty time-intensive. I'm willing to work for free, as it is an ""unpaid internship,"" for the experience because I hope to work in the magazine business in the future. This internship would provide me with valuable references and experiences to use in the coming years.

Ok, so cut to today. My dad hands me an article recently published by the New York Times. [Link here](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/business/03intern.html). Basically it says that, legally, unpaid internships should provide a learning environment for the type of work that should mimic that which you could obtain in a classroom setting. Additionally, according to the US Department of Labor, the organization must ""derive no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees and on occasion the employer’s operations may actually be impeded."" (Source: Fair Labor and Standards Act). If this and 5 other conditions are not met, the company must pay the employee at least minimum wage. Any unpaid labor from which they derive a benefit is entirely illegal. It is essentially slave labor - making someone do your work for no pay (or breaks!)


So, in summary, I'm in quite a predicament. I know that this company is making me work on illegal grounds, but I desperately need the experience to help me in the future. I know that if I go to my boss and tell her that what she's doing is illegal and that she must pay me, she'll most likely fire me flat-out, and hire a ""volunteer"" to do the same thing as me. My only thought is that I could continue working for them for the rest of the summer, and then (of course, after using their references) file a claim through the Department of Labor demanding wages that are rightfully mine. -- actually, this is a terrible idea and would just be burning bridges

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm in a bit of a jam.


EDIT: I sort of enjoy what I'm doing, although it's only been a few weeks. It's not really the greatest thing in the world, sitting in front of a bright computer monitor for 6 hours straight. I could really be using these extra 20 hours a week working at my paid job, getting extra money but gaining little 'career' experience. But I feel really uncomfortable knowing that this company is using my skills for free when the law says that I should be compensated for my work. Especially when my boss does the same amount of work that I do, and she gets paid a shitload for the sake of ""seniority."" It's my own personal work done on my own time, and while my name in the paper might be a great form of 'payment,' my gut and the US government tells me that what's going on isn't quite right

EDIT II: Additionally, a bunch of other interns work at this office and have been for awhile. I feel like if I went in this week and said to them all ""Hey, don't you think we should be getting paid? The Dept of Labor says we have to be,"" I might rouse some support. Of course, I'm not really trying to start a rebellion, and I'm more of the passive-aggressive type anyway, but what this and other companies across the country are doing to college students and recent graduates is just plain wrong"

I'm curious as to see what drives people to forgo opportunities to make immediate income and instead choose to continue their study and intellectual development by entering graduate school. I know oftentimes these people won't be making any more money than if they would have just entered the job market immediately after their undergrad. So I'm curious as to what drives people to take this path.

I'm entering my last year of undergrad, and after doing a summer internship I've never been more sure that I'd like to go to grad school. It's not that I don't like what I do in my internship. I like the people I work with. The work they do is important, but it feels easy and limited. I've always been the type of person that gets a thrill from pulling all-nighters doing hmwk or just reading or researching. I like to be challenged, especially intellectually. I think grad studies would serve this.

Another reason I ask this is because I just love to hear people that are intellectually passionate about something.

So these are my questions:

* Do you love it or do you regret going to grad school? 
* What initially brought you to pursue a graduate degree?
* What is your field?
* What do you hope to contribute to your field?

There are three major purveyors of hats, one telegraph company, and two imbeciles who have each inherited half of an empire of gravel pits spanning the Americas.  The two imbeciles, Blutarch and Redmond Mann, have each hired a team of the world's deadliest mercenaries to take from each other by force what they could not take through bureaucracy.

Zephenia Mann left his sons half of his empire, but left his Australium to Elizabeth, his maidservant, for safekeeping and his weapons concern to his tracker, Barnabas Hale.  Together, their descendants, Saxton Hale and Helen, ensure that MANN Co. is kept in business - by supplying the latest weapons to the current incarnation of the mercenaries hired so long ago by Blutarch and Redmond.

Meanwhile, CRIKEY, a corporation owned by the King of Australia controls the world's technology companies access to Australium and manages the balance of power in the world.  Control of Australia is key in order to produce the vital brew, me'lager, a lager infused with Australium which extends the drinker's life and grants limited prescient abilities.  Australium is also the key to advanced research being done at the Black Mesa Guild in the area of foldspace technology.

But in Australia, not all is well.  The muscular, intelligent, moustached masses secretly dream of a day when a prophet would come and transform Australia into a more hospitable place, one where annoying foreigners wouldn't come nearly as often, and if they were going to come, at least drink some me'lager and become prescient and good at fighting predatory mammals like the rest of them.

When the great tailor Robin came to Australia in 1893 he told the Freeman (as the Australians pronounce it) that they could transform their continent.  By convincing the mercenaries that enrich House MANN that the pursuit of ever-more fabulous hats is more important than fighting over a gravel processing plant or a suitcase full of stuff the intern found in the recycling.

The freemen were content to wait for their plan to come to fruition.  In their watering holes, they laboured to make the finest, most magnificent hats that anyone could imagine.  They were content to wait until 1960, when Delmond Coghaner, exiled son of House Aperture came to them.  They recognized him as the one fortold by Robin Walker, continentologist.

Dell fakes his own death and joins the Freemen, who are at first reluctant to accept outsiders, but when they realize he can drink me'lager like the rest of them, they accept him and teach him about Australia.

As House MANN pushes into Australia, an ally of Robin Walker uses a domesday weapon to unleash a sandstorm of speculation and fangirl gossip and Dell sneaks into the city and challenges Fail-Ronald, MANN Co's finest spy to a melee duel.  Despite cloak-and-dagger treachery, Dell's wrench defeats Fail-Ronald's knife and he demands Saxton Hale and Helen hand over their supply of Australium to him, molded into 100 copies of the weapon he just used to smash their sneaking no-good-traitor-frenchman.  They refuse and just as Saxton Hale is about to crush Dell's skull with his bare hands, Dell says ""you know, if I don't come out of here alive, I'm going to blow your Australium mines sky-high and destroy the source of it forever.  

House MANN is defeated, Dell gets his wrench and ascends to become the Emperor of Australia.

My father is a medical professor, my mother was an elementary teacher, my uncle was a math teacher, my cousin is a middle school teacher and I have taught creative writing during a summer internship. We talk about education and it interests us. They think the following idea is promising on a number of levels and I am working on writing a small thesis in my own time on this concept. Its quite simple and timely, I think.

I have been inspired by a simple idea that I would like to get your feedback on. I assume many of you are teachers or possibly administrators. 

How does the following idea strike you? 

It would be beneficial for english students to have all of their work uploaded to the web and shared with the surrounding community and the students themselves. It would be beneficial to catalog the process of writing for students from a young age up through graduation by creating a digital portfolio of students work and making that portfolio available to other students and the public online. 

I think that if english students were given the opportunity to share their work online that as a classmates they could view what each other's work looked like and discussions could be created as to what they think is quality work as students. I went through an entire public school education and it was never shared with me how other students in my class wrote, we never talked about it, you wrote, were given your grades, and then moved on to the next assignment. If all of a class's work was uploaded to the web students could read each others work and get an idea of what is being written in their class as a whole. There was no interaction at a student to student level on the work that was being done when I was in school and I think I would have been interested in reading what my classmates had written and I would have been interested in discussing the work in critiquing environment.

I think it would also be beneficial to students to have a digital portfolio of their work made available online so that after 12 years of education students are left with more than an alphabet soup of grades that are only meaningful to other educators. I think that if students had a portfolio of work that they could reference online that it would be beneficial to them when applying to colleges as the student would be more fairly represented by the work they did as opposed to the grade they received. Online portfolios of student work would be beneficial to parents who could see what kind of work was being done in the school and what kind of work was being produced. Grades can be fudged and might not communicate as clearly as the work itself. 

What is your first impressions of these ideas?

I could go on but if this sounds interesting at this point please comment because I would like to discuss this with people outside of my family as I am slowly making progress and am planning on discussing this concept with local schools this fall in an attempt to bolster my case for uploading and saving student work.

tl:dr - &gt; Would it be beneficial to upload student writing to the web on a regular basis? Would it be beneficial to create student portfolios of class work that could be viewed by the public online?"

The most annoying thing to me is the inevitable weekly variation of ""look at the photos I took with a disposable/phone/cheap camera - you don't need to buy a dslr.""

Equally frustrating are the inevitable defenses quoting the relatively few, obvious as a cripple at a ski resort retorts (""small sensors are bad at night photography"" ""but camera phones can't produce shallow depth of field... etc).

I am a photo student, and when I got to my university 2 years ago I was confused about why so few of my colleagues were as immersed in the online photography subculture as I. 

I've found my answer.

Online photographers are overwhelmingly enthusiasts. They are *not* working in professional photography, and if they are, they usually have had no schooling or internship experience. There is a major lack of knowledge about the tools and trade of real professionals.

I'm not looking to change the tone of online photography discussions - I know it's impossible. And you've probably figured out by now that this post is utterly pointless. 

All I'm looking for is a few people to say ""yeah, I hate those.""

**Edit:** My mention of online photographers being overwhelmingly enthusiasts wasn't a crack at the enthusiasts. It was a statement meant to highlight the online culture's obsession with **camera gear,** while the professional community has a (in my opinion) far healthier obsession with **images**.

I played in bands throughout high school and have only messed around for fun since. It seems like starting a band is almost a thing of the past nowadays though, so if I wanted to pursue music, I'm not quite sure even how I'd do so?

cndat,1,2010-07-08,Dear reddit: I have to interview a movie director this week. I've never done an interview. Can you help me think of some intriguing questions to ask him?,starving_artisan,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cndat/dear_reddit_i_have_to_interview_a_movie_director/,"My boss at my internship just sort of threw this task on me this week. I'm an intern - limited to filing, shredding, and restocking toilet paper. What am I supposed to know about conducting interviews? Well, I hope to do a great job - maybe I'll end up getting paid at some point, but I'm totally stuck as to what sort of questions to ask this guy.

The movie is called *Restrepo*. Basically these camera guys followed around US soldiers in Afghanistan while they were in combat. Here's what the press release says about it:


Restrepo, a feature-length documentary that chronicles the deployment of a platoon of U.S. soldiers inAfghanistan's Korengal Valley. The movie focuses on a remote 15-man outpost, ""Restrepo,"" named after a platoon medic who was killed in action. It was considered one of the most dangerous postings in the U.S. military. This is an entirely experiential film: the cameras never leave the valley; there are no interviews with generals or diplomats. The only goal is to make viewers feel as if they have just been through a 94-minute deployment. This is war, full stop. The conclusions are up to you.

 
DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT
The war in Afghanistan has become highly politicized, but soldiers rarely take part in that discussion. Our intention was to capture the experience of combat, boredom and fear through the eyes of the soldiers themselves. Their lives were our lives: we did not sit down with their families, we did not interview Afghans, we did not explore geopolitical debates. Soldiers are living and fighting and dying at remote outposts in Afghanistan in conditions that few Americans back home can imagine. Their experiences are important to understand, regardless of one’s political beliefs. Beliefs can be a way to avoid looking at reality. This is reality.


Starting in June 2007, Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger dug in with the men of Second Platoon, making a total of ten trips to the Korengal on assignment for Vanity Fair Magazine and ABC News. Each trip started with a helicopter flight into the main firebase in the valley and then a two-hour foot patrol out to Restrepo. There was no running water at Restrepo, no internet, no phone communication, and for a while, there was no electricity or heat; it was essentially just sandbags and ammo. Some days the outpost was attacked three or four times from distances as close as fifty yards. Hetherington and Junger – sometimes working together, sometimes alone – did everything the soldiers did except pull guard duty and shoot back during firefights. They slept alongside the soldiers, ate with them, survived the boredom and the heat and the cold and the flies with them, went on patrol with them, and eventually came to be considered virtually part of the platoon. By the end of the deployment, they had shot a total of 150 hours of combat, boredom, humor, terror, and daily life at the outpost.

 
Conditions for filmmaking couldn’t have been harsher. The surrounding mountains rose to a height of 10,000 feet – all of which was traversed on foot. Long operations meant carrying enough camera batteries to last a week or more, on top of the fifty or so pounds of gear required on even ordinary patrols. Cameras got smashed into rocks, clogged with dirt and hit with shell cartridges during firefights. Men were killed and wounded during filming, so there was a constant issue of when it was OK to turn on the cameras and when it was not. Only the filmmakers’ close relationship to the men of the platoon allowed them to keep shooting in situations where other journalists might have been told to stop. Three months after the end of the deployment, Hetherington and Junger traveled to Vicenza, Italy, where the unit is based. They used two Veri-Cams, a full light and sound package, and two cameramen to conduct in-depth interviews with their main characters. These interviews – initially considered a kind of glue for the verité, and a way to avoid outside narration – wound up being some of the most powerful and affecting material of the entire project. The soldiers were able to allow themselves a level of emotion and introspection that is simply not possible in combat.



Sorry if that's a lot (it is). I've thought of looking over other interviews of journalists stationed in the Middle East and mimicking their interviews, at least for a start. But I know all you reddit people are awesome and might have some good ideas."

I've seen a lot of amazing things happen here, from money being raised to help a sick redditor without health insurance, to random strangers offering organs, to music artists selling loads of CDs overnight. You guys really are a great community. 

Here's my story: I started working on a website just for my own entertainment and fun while I was on an internship in college.  A year later I ended up finding links to it on iambored.com, blogs, and forums.  People actually liked it! So I put more work into it (on the side of course on top of school and now a full-time job).  

Basically it uses Last.FM feeds to help you find and listen to new artists that you may like.  It allows you to explore an interactive web of related artists.  I finally set it up with Amazon and iTunes affiliate links back in March or so.  So far I've made $1.55 [Picture of the check](http://imgur.com/Ox0a0.gif). So it works! It gets on average about 170-1,000 hits a day (depending on blog posts or reviews, but usually max 300 hits). I think it just needs more attention and to be honest I'm barely able to cover the hosting fees, let alone pay for expensive advertising campaigns. If you happen to already buy music through iTunes/Amazon please use my site to do so if you find it useful!

I would also LOVE feedback, constructive criticism, ANYTHING! I know the UI could be improved I'm just not sure how yet. ::nervous inhale:: So without further ado, I present to you, [MusicRoamer](http://www.musicroamer.com). Thanks in advance for even reading if you did.

ALSO! Try the konami code on it :)

**TL;DR.** I am 90k in school loan debt and I really believe my website has a chance.  Please reddit for the love of god try it out and comment!  

**UPDATE:** Thank you all so much for the feedback and for sending my site to friends/significant others/family! I've gotten almost 150 hits just from reddit in 5 hours. I will be hard at work trying to make all of your recommended changes. I seriously appreciate it, you guys are awesome!

What are my options?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cnj3m/disliking_my_internship_and_want_to_pursue_a/,"Background: This fall will begin my senior year of college. I am majoring in business economics with a minor in political science. Through some stroke of luck I was able to land a reputable internship a few hours from home that pays well and treats their employees well. It's sort of like google on a miniature scale in terms of culture (rock band, foosball, beer all at the office with 5 weeks starting vacation time). 

I realize that I will probably never have it better than this in the business world, but am generally unhappy with daily events (I analyze shopping data on Excel and provide insights to companies) and looking for something else.

Search: I know the common groups students typically look to join (Peace Corps, TFA, etc.) and am planning on browsing the Americorps site for the next few months.

cnjr4,0,2010-07-08,I just got fired...,justgotletgo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cnjr4/i_just_got_fired/,"Basically since orientation it seems my manager had it out for me.

My ex-company requires new hires to complete some online training courses but since I was an intern and my internship wasn't going to last until the due date of the courses I made a **joke** about how I wouldn't need to do them. My manager was sitting at my table. I completed those courses within 2 weeks of starting and none of the other interns have done so, atleast as of this past Monday. She brought the joke up in the meeting, and when I heard that given as reason, I just looked at her and was thinking WTF?!?!? and she just looked at me and does the shoulder raise. Can't really describe what she did but it seemed she purposefully worded it in a way as to detract from my work. 

They complained about my attendance. Some of it was truth but most of it was either lies or half-truths said in a fashion to make it look bad. For example, I told my manager that one morning I need to go pick up my granddad and dad from the airport but told the supervisor that my dad picked him up and I have to go pick him up from the airport. I later realized I phrased that pretty badly and when I couldn't find my supervisor through phone, email, or visiting her office to offer a clarification, I told my manager instead. I asked her to relay this information to my supervisor but she did not. That incident was brought up in the meeting. There is a whole list of other stuff like this and if anyone actually reads this and wants more, I'll tell them in an edit.

What I really want to know however is that does anyone know if it is the law to give an intern (full-time) two week notice or can they just terminate me on the spot?

I actually made a few comments to some other interns that I was either going to be fired or quit because my boss has it out for me. I said this maybe 2 weeks ago.

""As far as cooperation in the Silicon Valley is concerned, yesterday we paid heed that everyone wishes to call the Silicon Valley the Kremlin Valley in Russia.  Probably for English there is no difference, but in Russia there is.  So in the Kremlin Valley it was very interesting -- the visit, I mean"". 

Well, there is a little difference. The Russians are not going to invade California just yet. Here's a quick explanation. 
In English, silicon and silicone are pronounced similarly, but spelled differently. In Russian, there are two entirely different words for those terms: kremnii (no, that's not Kremlin) for silicon and silikon for silicone. Nevertheless, the ""Silicon Valley"" has historically been referred to as ""Silikonovaja Dolina"" (by transliteration) in Russian, which used to generate lots of unfunny jokes back in the 80's. Medvedev jokingly suggested to put the end to the controversy and to start calling the place ""Kremnievaja Dolina"".

Rent for me alone (I have 5 other roommates in this 3-bedroom thing) is $750/mo. for a furnished apartment, which comes out to $9000 for a whole year, $7500 for the time I plan to stay (I'm hoping to find someone else to take over the contract for the summer). I signed the lease a few months ago, but they mentioned that I could find someone to replace me on the lease at any time. I don't move in until September. I asked my parents twice if they were fine with paying for it, with me covering all the utilities and food with my own money.

Earlier, I was completely fine about staying at this place, but now I'm thinking I'd be chipping away at my parents' finances too much (we're middle-class). Part of me keeps feeling like I'm acting like some type of selfish entitlement brat by just letting them foot the bill and not looking back. 

On one hand, I feel perfectly fine about commuting to school for yet another year, even though everyone keeps throwing hypotheticals at me such as ""Well, what if you want to take a girl back to your place? Oh, wait..."" . Learning how to live on my own isn't really an issue here, since I'm in an apartment for an internship this summer.

So I'm curious, Reddit. What do you think?

tl;dr I signed the lease for an allegedly expensive apartment being paid for by my parents, who're okay with footing the bill. Am I a selfish prick?

Long time reader, first time posting! Anyway there is no collective brain larger than that of Reddit's so I figured that I would turn to you, this excellent community of fine people for some advice.

My situation is that I am two years into my design degree at a fairly high ranked art institution. I came out to a graphic design internship for the summer and have been offered a really solid salary (pretty high for someone without a college degree, and actually almost at the medium salary range for that particular position). Now I am torn whether to take the job or to return to school to finish up my degree. I guess ultimately I wanted to ask if when you weigh the difference between solid work experience vs. a degree, what would be best, especially in our current job market? School and work are 2500 miles apart too, so I can't really do both. Also going to work will offset my loans for the last two years (25k+), and I can always return to school, but I will seriously miss everyone there.

TL;DR - Finish school or enter the workforce in a field that I was getting my degree for?


EDIT: I have ultimately decided to take the job, all while taking classes during the year and on top of that will be returning to school to finish my degree once the year is up. I have informed my employer of my plan and they are very okay with it, pleased actually. The only people who aren't are my friends back at school.

&gt;What is your favorite word or expression?  
&gt;&gt;According to anyone who talks to me more than five minutes, ""exactly"" is, hands down, my favorite word. I just like expressing agreement, that's all.
I also like the phrase ""Tres tristes tigres comen Trigo en un trigal"". It's a Spanish tongue-twister. It basically means, ""Three sad tigers eating wheat in a wheat field"". I love it because I can say it decently well, and because... well... I suppose that's why the poor tigers are sad. Wouldn't you be sad if you were a tiger, having to eat wheat in a wheat field? Poor tigers... :-(  

##Miscellanea  

&gt;What makes you laugh?  
&gt;&gt;Nearly everything, except things that piss me off. Seriously. I'm a pretty happy person, and I make lots of silly jokes, and bad puns. The thing that makes me laugh the most is getting other people to laugh. It's a terrible addiction.  

&gt;What is your best feature and what is your worst bug?  
&gt;&gt;The few times the subject has come up, when others describe what they like or appreciate about me, my sense of humour is usually what's mentioned - that I always make them laugh.
My worst bug, by sheer impact on my life, is ADHD. It causes me so many problems: missed deadlines, missed conversation cues, lost items (I seriously have insight on what it's like to be old - all that stuff like sitting something down, turning around, and it's gone? Walking into a room having forgotten why in the hell I was going there? That's my life NOW. I hate to think what it's going to be like whene I do get old)... But there are some upsides to ADHD: Hyperfocus kicks ass, and I have a solid sense of direction (I can usually get to new places without getting lost; once I've gotten there, backtrack without consulting a map, and get there again years later with no map - most places, if I've been there once in my life, I can get back there). But one downside to ADHD: I am extremely verbose. I'm being as short as I
reasonably can, but I still have to apologize to the TL;DR crowd...  

&gt;What is your biggest pet peeve?  
&gt;&gt;Intolerance. hands down. I believe firmly in tolerance and equality, no matter the race, religion (or lack thereof), gender, sexual preference, etc. What REALLY gets me going is when some intolerant fool spouts off about how I'm being intolerant of them being intolerant. That's one of the few times I wish I could reach through the Internet and slap the living tar out of people.  

&gt;What general area of your country you live in? Do you love it?  
&gt;&gt;Since the Glenn Beck meme from last year (I'm the guy behind the website, which is [still up and running](http://DidGlennBeckRapeAndMurderAYoungGirlIn1990.com), I don't mind saying my name and where I'm from, because I'm very much findable...
I'm in the so-far-still-beautiful town of Panama City, Florida, where as of this writing, we've only had tarballs.
There are things I love here: The beach (although I only actually go there about once a year), lots of good people (except when they drive, but that's true everywhere), hurricanes (I'm a weather geek), lack of real traffic jams (except Spring Break, but I live in town and that's on the beach).There are things I hate here: There are some fellow libtard commies here, but most of the populace is... well, let's just say they enjoy lots of tea and leave it there, shall we?  

&gt;What was the best thing about the last year?  
&gt;&gt;After my ADHD diagnosis a few years ago, I finally got back into college for Fall 2008. In Spring 2009, I got an internship as a computer programmer for a U.S. Forest Service lab in Seattle, Washington. After having so much trouble before my diagnosis with losing jobs and feeling worthless, I finally got to contribute something useful - a program I wrote to control a model framework to make the work of scientists easier is actually being used and is making an impact. 
And I fell in love with Seattle and the pacific northwest, and now I want to move there desperately.  I got to work the rest of the year from my home in Florida, doing work that is making a difference. That's such a huge change from before, when I'd figured I was just a lazy no-good do-nothing worthless human. So even though times have been tough in 2010, I know things will eventually work out... if I can just find someone who'd like to pay me for being awesome. heh.  

&gt;What are you looking forward to in the next year?  
&gt;&gt;Right now, the internship funding isn't there, so I'm essentially unemployed. The only web programming / web design projects I've got are unpaid. So I'm working, but broke. Also, can't afford to continue my college education until I get income again... So I'm looking forward to getting that all working again, and hopefully something will happen in the timeframe of ""next year"".  

&gt;If you were granted one do-over what would it be?  
&gt;&gt;Wish I'd been diagnosed with ADHD much sooner.  

&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?  
&gt;&gt;Hands down, my wife.  

##Concerning reddit:  

&gt;How did you come up with your user name?

&gt;How long did you lurk before signing up?  
&gt;&gt;Three days, and I know this precisely. :-)
On 31 August 2009, the Glenn Beck meme started over on Fark. I'd visited Reddit a couple of times, but hadn't signed up - only followed the occasional link from friends.
While Fark was busy banning any mention of the Beck meme, a thread about it hit the frontpage over here on Reddit.A thread specifically about my website hit the frontpage on 2 September, and I signed up to comment. I stayed.  

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?  
&gt;&gt;Just this one.  

&gt;What are some of your favorite subreddits?  
&gt;&gt;Right now, [/r/oilspill](http://reddit.com/r/oilspill) and [/r/Gulf](http://reddit.com/r/Gulf), because I live in Panama City, so the oil spill is very much on my mind.
Another favorite is [/r/obert_paulson](http://reddit.com/r/obert_paulson), which is a reddit I created in honour and support of the long-running ""His name is Robert Paulson"" thread, which I found a couple or so months ago. (link to the latest can be found there)I found this reddit a few days ago, and I'm slowly becoming attached - I've read a few, and I'm trying to keep up. It's pretty sweet. :)
I've also subscribed to all fifty states, and some of the Canadian provincial reddits - part of my effort to find a better Reddit, because I unsubbed from most of the default reddits like /r/reddit.com. Others I like: [/r/frugal](http://reddit.com/r/frugal), [/r/canada](http://reddit.com/r/canada), I'm definitely looking for more, smaller reddits to join...  

&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit?  
&gt;&gt;ERROR: DIVIDE BY ZERO ERROR. SYSTEM HALTED.
With the release of WordPress3, I've rebooted my blogging efforts: [Isaac.im](http://Isaac.im/). I don't blog too much because I don't have many readers, but I'm spamming^H^H^H^H^Halerting my Facebook friends when I do blog something, so 
that's slowly helping. Also, I'm a theatre geek and often can be found designing and running sound for productions at my local community theatre (when I don't get cast, which does happen occasionally); although I'm currently on break.  

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so? If so, do you think it’s been for the better?  
&gt;&gt;Well, I haven't quite been here a year, yet... but nearly ten months. And in that time, I've definitely noticed a lessening of quality. But it's hard for me to tell if that's just because I've gotten spoiled, or what.The dialogue most other places ranges from the inane (Youtube, for example) to the tolerable (Fark, Slashdot). In comparison, Reddit is freaking awesome. However, it seems like there's ever more poop questions in /r/AskReddit (the 
main reason I unsubbed from there) and useless juvenile stuff clogging up the tubes... And that's sad, because I have a high tolerance for silliness... but, to me, there's a difference between Monty Python and Jackass; and I've noticed more and more of the latter that overwhelms the former. And the difference between the two, on Reddit, can appear somewhat subtle and hard to define.So I don't know if it's just that I've become used to the awesomeness, and now tend to notice the stupidity; or if the stupidity has actually increased.Either way, you aren't getting rid of me anytime soon. :)"

So the story goes like this...
About 18 months aog, my friend saw that his 15 hour stints on WOW left him nothing but degenerated social skills and a few level 70 (or 80) characters. His time spent in the game was flooded with times of running out of food (eating spoonfuls of peanut butter coupled with jelly), discentegrating relationships with roommates (new girls moved in the house, he didn't see them the first 3 weeks they lived there), declining personal hygine (he ran out of toilet paper so when he would take a shit he showered instead of wiping), and countless other things.
He came out of this funk with a great joy in life, we went to the bar, watched baseball, played cornhole, and found things such as cooking 80 dollars worth of food in a single sitting to be a stellar idea (not a great idea, but we had some amazing creations). All the people around were happy to have our long lost friend back. He graduated with a soild degree, had a solid internship and then he had to move back home in attempt to find a job.
Now he is at home, I haven't gotten ahold of him for 2 months. I found out the other day he is playing WOW until 4 or 5 in the morning on a daily basis.
Does anyone have any ideas of how to get ahold of the bastard or to stop this WOW madness before it gets even more out of control?"

So for a little background, I’m 22, an engineering student currently on an internship in one of the bigger cities in the states. I’m only here for the summer before I head back to school. 

Anyway, July 4th, rolled around and I ended up meeting three great ladies at the bar. We all hit it off and hung out a lot last week. I noticed right off the bat that one of the girls (lets call her Betty) wanted to be more than friends, and that was confirmed when she came over along on Thursday. After the initial awkward dust settled, she started to flirt over the top and eventually full on made a move. After a decent make out session, I pulled back and suggested this might be a bad idea. When asked why, I proceeded to tell her all my faults – I’m only around for 2 months, just looking for a fun time, definitely don’t want a girl friend, known to be notorious for one night stands, think a lot with my dick, etc, etc. After some initial hesitation on her part, she decides she wants to have sex with me anyway, and at this point I’m way too horny to argue any further against my pecker. We had sex. Rinse. Repeat.

The entire group continues to hang out on the weekend (Betty and her friend + me and my buddy from back home), and we hit a few bars. Chick comes on to me again, we go for round 2. However, at this point, things were not looking so peachy for me. She seemed to be getting clingy and whatever I said on Thursday seemed to have gone in one ear and out the other.

Come monday we all go for a concert at the local watering hole. I'm double fisting beer and having a great time. Through out the night I kept mentioning to her and her friends how I love being single, joked around about cheating, etc,etc.

Later on in the night as the band is packing up, this hot little thing (lets call her Veronica) comes over and strikes up a conversation. She is obviously flirting hard, and I can't help myself, and flirt back. End up finding out that shes from Russia, and since I approach my conquests like I do a game of Risk, I was immediately intrigued.

This is where it gets juicy. A lot more alcohol is involved, resulting in a lot more flirting. My buddy later tells me that Betty was giving everybody dagger eyes, and was not pleased with what was going on in front of her. Knowledge I didn't process in my drunken haze. I start getting a lot more touchy, feely and am actively hitting on Veronica. I'm pretty sure at one point i told the girl that ""I wish you were a cell phone, cause I want to work a number on that ass..."" (I know, I have no clue why I get laid either...)

We end up making out on a now completely empty dance floor. Betty comes out of nowhere and says ""You are a fucking asshole! You can fucking lose my number."" To which I, for an unknown reason, decide to respond to with hysterical laughter while my friend and her friend restrain her as she wants to take a swing at me.

I take Veronica aside, diffuse the situation, make out some more, get her number and book it out the bar. 

On my arrival home, I promtly try to fix things by trying to send an email saying the following. The only reason it didn't go through, is cause the room mate wrsetled the computer out of my hands:

Dear Betty

I'm sorry about last night. The alcohol is definitely my cryptonite. While I shouldn't have done what I did, its not like you didn't know who I was. I mentioned on multiple occasion that I was an asshole, a bad boyfriend, ________, ________ (feel free to replace the blanks with whatever expletives you want). But I never lied to you about who I was. I'm sorry you had to see that (I regret that happening in front of you) but when I'm drunk my true personality comes out.

Like I mentioned on Thursday (before we did the nasty, which was pretty fucking amazing), I hope we don't regret this. And I really hope we can still be friends.

You are truly an amazing individual.


Also apparently, at some point in the night she sent me a message saying ""you are disgusting. I've never felt so embarassed in my life"", to which I responded ""its hard forgetting your number when you keep texting me""

So now wise old Reddit, how do I fix this? I've gone through various scenarios in my head but all dont end well... Would like to still be friends with the group..."
cpc22,1,2010-07-14,"RE: Dillon Cossey, ""Columbine wannabe""",Condawg,WTF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/cpc22/re_dillon_cossey_columbine_wannabe/,"A friend of mine recently told me the story of a local boy (of whom she is friends with the mother) who, a few years back, at the ripe age of 14, was arrested for plots of obliterating students in his school.

His name is Dillon Cossey. Here's the basic story...

He's a really big dude. Because of this, he was bullied at school. The school eventually called his mother, Michelle, and asked her to remove her son from the *(public)* school, because his presence there was not conducive to him nor the school itself.

His mother removed him. She had him schooled over the internet. He made friends with a kid named Lou Bennett. Lou and Dillon got together and boiled up a plot to take down the school. They had no means to do this, but they acquired floor plans and plotted out where they would place bombs to take it down. It was a sick fantasy, but it **was** just a fantasy; just two kids having their own weird kind of fun.

Well, one day they got in a fight. Lou went home and presented all of the plans to his father, exclaiming ""Look at what Dillon's been planning."" His father alerted the authorities and the next morning, Dillon was awoken by several police cars waiting to take him into custody.

My friend had been in school the planned day of the attack. She had an internship, and as such, left school at 12:00. As she prepared to leave, it went into full lock-down, with the school being surrounded by around 25 police cars and having helicopters flying overhead. Fox News even reported that a kid had been shot. (Big surprise, eh?)

None of the students (or *teachers*) were informed of the situation. Mass panic in the building. Eventually, my friend got out (and was allowed to pass by an officer who chalked her up as no threat (mind you, even the officers had no idea what was happening inside, at all)). 

So, jumping back to Dillon. He was arrested and sent to juvie until he's 21. This was two years ago, and he was 14 at the time. The judge told his (incredibly religious) mother that it was a ""devious act of god that allowed [her] to bare children.""

The mother was also arrested for six months for having a weapon licensed in her name, although her husband was not allowed anywhere near guns. (She kept the handgun at a friend's house, in a safe. The judge was out to fuck this family over, and did so very effectively.)

The news outlets went nuts. Reports flew around, saying that aforementioned Lou Bennett was a ""hero"" for reporting Dillon to authorities, and that Dillon had planned a ""columbine-style shooting"" at the school, which was, of course, a complete fabrication, considering the fact that he had ""planned"" (in fairytale land) to blow it up, without any means whatsoever to carry out his plans. 

Some media outlets said that Michelle had purchased several guns for her son. Some even [quote her](http://www.weirduniverse.net/blog/comments/dillon_cossey/), saying that she purchased him a rifle to ""help his self-esteem,"" when she had never purchased a rifle, ever.  

Lou was met by George Bush in Philadelphia, to reward him for his ""heroic"" actions. Motherfucker got his hand shaken by the president.

Well, in the later months, this Lou kid robbed the fuck out of Dillon's vacant room. Stole his airsoft guns, his video games (of which he had a shit-ton), as well as other shit. He sold it at school. Eventually he got caught, at which point George W. Bush looked like even *more* of a dumbass.

But he never got busted or even got recognized as a kid who helped plan the ""attack"" that Dillon got buttfucked for. Media outlets completely blew the story wide open with outright fabrications and nothing but lies. This has made me even more aware of how fucked up the media in this fucking country is, as well as the judicial system. I'm not going to defend Dillon; I feel that his punishment was far too severe for actions that he *hadn't* done or actually planned on **actually** doing, but they did completely fuck over his mother (who is, from what I hear, one of the nicest women you'll ever meet).

So, if you've heard about this story (it was apparently hugely talked about everywhere, but I hadn't heard of it at the time), be informed that everything you've heard is complete and utter bullshit. No story I've read even mentions bombs; they try to make an advantage of him by saying that he wanted to impersonate the Columbine shooters, when this is incredibly and utterly false."
cpcoq,18,2010-07-14,Need to know how to reject guys,Tallon5,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/cpcoq/need_to_know_how_to_reject_guys/,"Girl, 18, here. I need some advice.

So, *apparently* in the past half year I've gotten hot. I'm only saying this based on the increased amount of approaches I've gotten from guys. For instance, I have an out-of-state internship that I started at the beginning of June, so I've been there since. At the beginning of the second week, one of the guys asked me out. Now, since I've had next to no experience with dating, I said sure, plus I was caught off guard. Well, I ended up dating him until the end of the month when he had to leave because summer school first term ended. The thing is, I didn't even have feelings for him the first three weeks - only during the last week. I also felt like the things we did went way too fast. I found it practically impossible to say no because that thought didn't even enter my mind. I felt as if he was entitled to do things with me. I didn't really feel that bad about it afterwards, but I would like to have more control over the situation in the future. Also, since he left, I've had one other guy here make a move on me, and another guy who's been flirting with me for a few weeks now. I feel so intimidated - how should I react?

What I’m trying to say is that, at this point, I don’t know what to do with all this attention. For some reason, I have a really hard time rejecting people. Furthermore, if I get the slightest hint that a guy likes me, I will either 1) continue hanging out with him and not be able to reject him when he inevitably tries to make a move; or 2) try to avoid him for a little bit because I don’t want him to like me. It’s increasingly difficult for me to regard guys as friends, and that is a bummer. 

I've decided I don't want to date guys for a while anyway (more interested in girls now that I have some experience), so I guess I could just go with that for now (opinions on this?). But in the future, if I do decide to date guys again - I mean, I need to know how to reject someone firmly and kindly and not feel so intimidated (and of course, this applies to girls too, but I get a lot more approaches from guys). As an example of this, I have a friend back home who I know for a fact has liked me since March, but I'm not interested in him as more than a friend. So...I need to get better at this rejection thing.

Comments/advice strongly appreciated!

EDIT: Wanted to say thank you to everyone who posted. I am definitely going to practice being blunt and being less passive!"

I am a CS major, and since it's summertime, I am working as an intern for an educational research group at my local university. Specifically, I am working on building a virtual campus in Second Life for them. They also hired two co workers: one who is a very good coder, Paul, and an upcoming freshmen, Chris. Finally, there is our supervisor, Samantha. She is for the most part a ""hands off supervisor"". She gives us broad goals, and we come up with and build specific things. It doesn't matter how we get things completed, so long as we're making progress.

Chris has no programming experience, and sometimes feels a little overwhelmed because the scripting language can get complicated, and we're always scripting. So I let him borrow an intro to java textbook I got during my freshmen year, and have been nagging him to read through it

Lately, I have taken to just work at home. It's completely fine with my supervisor, and she even suggested it to me, but I still feel a little guilty not taking the commute in everyday, while Paul and Chris sit in the office

Today was going well until a few hours in, when I these messages in Second Life from Samantha:

The whole conversation was really weird. 15 minutes later, I get a message from Chris, about how Samantha is all mad that he's wasting time reading up on java. Apparently it was my fault, in some way. So I get ready to drive down to the office and resolve this, when I get an email from Paul titled: A Lovely Conversation. And it struck me.

Paul had access to Samantha's account.

And I was going to bring in cookies for a birthday party that didn't exist.

So I wrote a macro that will take attachments from an outlook folder and store it on a network drive.  The problem is *sometimes* when I run it again, I get an error about the file being in use (never on the local drive - and this error happens to a seemingly random file). The IT guy said it probably has to due with the drive not releasing permission in time. Now, I don't foresee this being a major problem as it only tends to happen when there are lots of attachment laden emails in the folder, and I will be having the macro remove the mails once its done with them (thus won't need to overwrite), however I want to make sure this doesn't happen to the user. How should I handle this?

A little background - I'm an intern at a shipbroking company, doing non - programming stuff, this is just a side project. I have very little programming exp (carlh and one very simple vba class), so I don't know a lot and google has not seemed to help with this one.

Thanks a lot!

If you need to look at my code, or have any questions please let me know.

I would like to start a small publishing company. Now, please spare me from tirades detailed with assertions about the anachronism of the paperback and failure rates of small businesses. I don't expect things to go particularly easily or my company to grow into a massive conglomerate or hire any employees. I have done enough research to know that I have to potential to build something moderately successful, but I by no means have delusions of grandeur. I would not expect to exceed revenues of $30,000 within the first few years and would structure it as an LLC.

What I would like to know is -- could there be future negative consequences for starting such a business? For example, I imagine I would not be able to eventually get a job at a large publishing company because I would technically be competing against them. I also assume I'd be able to transfer ownership of my company to a family member to avoid this sort of conflict of interest? It isn't even that I am set on working in the publishing field in the future -- the reason this question came up was because a few internships I applied for this summer were with publishing houses, and I am unsure if pursuing something independently could hurt future professional prospects or harm me in any way (other than lost time and money).

I'm a CS major employed in retail full time as low level retail management. I live near a big metro area. I also do some web design work on the side, but it's pretty scarce and is not stable enough to rely on. 

I loathe retail. It's a job and pays the bills, but it's not the profession for me. I'd love to start getting experience in my field while I study, but I'm concerned about a couple of things.

1. I'm concerned a potential employer will see me as a student and think they can take advantage of that. I need money and I'm older than most college students. I don't want to be/can't be an unpaid or minimum wage intern.

2. I don't know how to start. I've had four jobs to date. Two are big retail chains where I just stopped by and filled out an application. Two were not retail related and I received through friends working with the employer.

In my experience Craigslist and Monster.com are filled with multi-level marketing scams and people who want something for free.

How would you suggest I go about finding myself a quality employer that is relevant to my major? I've had zero experience looking for ""real jobs"" as my retail peers call it. Is craigslist and monster as bad as I remember? Are newspapers still relevant?

I will provide details on my situation if asked. Thanks."

I've got an internship coming up for which I'd get £1500 almost, and I'm interested in upgrading my bass.  
By the time the internship has ended, I will have been playing for slightly over a year, and I currently use an Ibanez GSR200 (http://www.ibanez.com/BassGuitars/model-GSR200) and its been great the entire time I've had it, but I feel like I should go for an upgrade, or at least get another with that sort of money being readily available to me and nothing particular that I'll need it for anytime soon.  

So I was wondering if any of you could recommend me a bass in the £300-700 range that is good quality, would suit the style I tend to play (alt.rock mostly), and could be ordered for delivery in England.  
Currently I've been looking at either a James Johsnton signature (http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/product/42457-squier-by-fender-james-johnston-jazz-bass-biffy-clyro-signature-model-lake-placid-blue-.html) or a fender classic 70's jazz (http://www.guitarguitar.co.uk/bass_guitars_detail.asp?stock=09111214593528), but I'm not sure whether or not I should go for either, as I'm the only bassist I know so can't get any advice or recommendations from anyone personally.

Sorry if this seems a bit messy/long-winded, its nearly 2am and I'm tired, I'll try tidy this up tomorrow.  
  
Oh, and the reason I'm not throwing all the money I'm getting at a bass is that I'd like to save some of it, and keep some for a festival in 2011.  "

This probably sounds a little cliche, but..
Recently, I've had some of those moments where I'd come to this profound realization that I'm actually alive, that one day I'll actually die, and I'm just a living being on one planet, with my own thoughts, etc. I was sort of thinking like this for a few weeks, since I had too much time to think in my cubicle I suppose, and sometimes it would really make me feel anxious and/or depressed. I'd ask myself things like ""what is reality?"", and so forth.

Anyway, I think I'm pretty much over it, but ever since then I've had this craving to read or watch something about philosophy. Perhaps something that could put me at ease, give some interesting views on the issue, etc.

I am not into religion of any sort, and I know redditors are a pretty athiest and educated group for the most part, so I thought this would be a good place to ask.

cqptb,40,2010-07-17,Late at work,fermion72,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cqptb/late_at_work/,"I'm back in engineering graduate school, and this summer I landed a great internship at a big tech company in the Northeast.  The company is located in a giant, oddly shaped building off of a minor highway, forty-five minutes or so outside of a large city.  It's relatively rural, in other words, surrounded by forest on three sides, with a large parking lot that winds down to the road.  As I said, the building has a strange shape -- it's mostly square, but there is one corner which forms a ""V,"" and my cubicle happens to be right in the upper corner of one side of the V, such that I (and my cubemates -- we might have a corner-cube with windows, but there are three of us in here!) look out one of the large windows more or less directly into the windows in the other side of the V.  For some reason, that part of the building is vacant (I think the plan is to expand over there), and all that I can see is a couple of chairs and a fold-up table propped next to one of the windows.  It's a pretty big open space altogether.

Now, I used to be a high school teacher, and as it turns out I was asked if I could teach summer school in the same city where I'm working (it was a strange coincidence that I'm in town, actually).  Because of my full-time job, I declined the offer, but the school was in a bind and desperately needed a substitute teacher for one week, and I asked my boss if I could take the mornings off for one week and come into work late.  He said that was fine, as long as I worked a full 40-hour week, meaning I'd be in the office until 8 or 9pm each day that I taught.  I figured that I could handle 13-hour days for a week, so I decided to do it.  So, last Monday, I taught in the morning, and arrived at work at about 1pm.

The first couple of days of my evening work-week were pretty typical.  The office was bustling until about 5:30pm, at which time people started to trickle out of the office.  Most of the lights stayed on, but they must be on some sort of timer, because at about 7pm about half of the lights went out, and the office definitely seemed more deserted, and it had that ghost-town feel to it.  But, I had my work to do, and I didn't really notice.  I finished up about 8:30pm, turned off my computer, and headed down to my car, which I parked about half-way across the large parking lot.

Wednesday night, though, things got a bit strange.  First of all, more lights than normal went off at 7pm, and there were probably only about twenty percent of the lights on.  I definitely noticed, but didn't worry about it, and I didn't really mind working in the semi-dark.  As I went to leave that night, I went to open the door into the main hallway (it's got a sensor that unlocks it when you walk up), but it didn't open automatically.  I had to manually press a switch that unlocked the door.  Again, no worries -- maybe the sensor was on the same switch as the darkened lights.  I walked down the hall and down the main staircase, out the front door, and then into the parking lot, over to my car, which was alone in the center of the lot.  It was dark out, but the moon was shining, and the car glistened in the moonlight.  The car happened to be facing towards the building, and as I got into my car to leave, I happened to look back at the building, and I noticed that the empty room on the other side of the V had the lights on.  I thought this was odd, as I would have thought I would have noticed it from my darkened office right next to it.  I didn't really think too much of it, though, and I turned on the radio and went my way.

Thursday night, almost all of the lights went out at 7pm.  I began to think this was strange, being in my giant building all alone with the lights out, and I did start to get a bit creeped out.  I jumped when the A/C fan went on at one point, and I began to hear what I thought were steps along the cubes next to me.  I also thought I heard someone typing on the computer in the cube directly on the opposite side of where I sit.  I figured I was just tired, from the long days and all the work.  At about 8pm, I was sitting at my desk when I noticed out of the corner of my eye that the lights in the empty room had suddenly gone on.  As I swung my head over to look, they immediately went off, but I thought that I had seen a tall figure standing in the room, facing me from the window (which is about 15 feet from my window).  I got a cold shiver straight down my spine, and I decided that I'd worked enough for the day.  I packed up and got ready to leave.  I made my way (in the dark) towards the door but of course the automatic switch on the door didn't work again. Unfortunately, neither did the manual switch.  I panicked a bit, but then noticed an exit sign all the way down the other end of the hall, and I made my way towards it.  I ended up at another stairway (lighted, thankfully) and I went downstairs and found another exit out of the building.  It was a darker night, and I quickly made my way to my car, jumped in and tore out of the parking lot.

Friday night (last night) was my last day with the crazy schedule.  All afternoon I kept thinking about what might happen after everyone else had left, and I was already nervous by about 6:30pm.  At 7pm, the entire building went dark; the only light came from my computer monitor, and it gave my cube an eerie glow.  I could barely see to type, and I jumped at every little sound.  Again, I thought I heard typing, and there seemed to be more steps next to my cube.  I didn't dare leave the cube, but I started to plan my escape, wondering what was really going on.  By 7:30pm I had had enough, but just then I heard tapping on the window next to me (towards the empty office).  I almost had a heart attack, until I realized that it was just rain -- a storm had quickly blown in, and it was pouring out.  I took a deep breath, and finished putting my stuff away.  As I clicked off the computer monitor and stood up (leaving me in complete darkness), there was a tremendous bolt of lightning outside.  I turned to look, facing the empty office, and there was another huge lightning bolt.  The entire office next door was lit up.  And in each of the five windows stood a figure, arms at his sides, staring directly back at me.  I screamed and it was, of course, instantly dark again.  I totally panicked, grabbed my bag and went running for the door.  Amazingly, it opened with the manual switch, but the door to the stairway I normally took was locked--I didn't even know you could lock stairway doors.  I didn't know what I was going to do and then I noticed that there was a lighted exit sign down a different hallway, one which I had never been down.  As I started running towards the exit sign I realized -- I was running in the same direction as the empty office.  I stopped dead in my tracks, and didn't know what to do.  I decided to go for it, and I bolted towards the sign, which was like a glowing lighthouse -- the only thing I could see.  Just as I passed what must have been the doors to the empty office, the doors flew open, and I got knocked sideways, like I'd been hit by a train.  I careened into the wall, but somehow I managed to keep running.  I didn't dare look behind me, but somehow kept running for the stairs.  The next thing I knew, I was down the stairs and outside, into the thunderstorm.  I rushed to my car, fumbled with my keys and lept into it, driving as fast as I could out of the lot, towards home.

I didn't sleep much last night, but this morning as I was watching TV while eating breakfast, I saw a news report that said there had been a tornado that had gone through the town where I work.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw my building--they were showing the corner V and you could see that the empty office had been blown to smithereens.  I haven't talked to anyone from work yet today, but I'm definitely glad that my crazy week is over.

cr08i,24,2010-07-18,My Internet startup nightmare story,mexicatl,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/cr08i/my_internet_startup_nightmare_story/,"Six months ago, I had a couple of free weeks before leaving on vacation when I saw an ad on the university website put up by dotcom company looking for someone to do data entry. I show up the next day and they explain that the job was to put sample content on the website. I spend the next few hours hacking an interface into their back office and creating a database of content from the web to upload. At the end of the day, I explain that I can automate the process and instead of it taking two people two weeks, I can have it done in a couple of days.

The CEO was impressed even though the solution seemed rather obvious. I finish the job and I start helping them out with other things. I rewrite their terrible English and Spanish copy, write up a basic marketing strategy and give feedback on the website. I start understanding the business model and to see its potential. I'm also duly impressed by their big name partners but notice the CEO knows next to nothing about computers or the Internet.

So a week before leaving, I ask the CEO if he's looking to hire. I tell him that they need someone like me who has startup experience, having worked at a few already and owning equity in all of them. He tells me that all they're looking for is interns, so I tell him that I understand given that the website is about to launch and that I was willing to accept a short ""internship"", maybe some stock options and a basic stipend to pay for my expenses. He agrees and says he'll draw up a contract.

So I start work, seven days a week. I work during my vacation, developing new partners and searching for marketing firms. He showers me with compliments and sends out an email to his partners and investors saying I am the new Marketing Manager. Awesome I think.

I get back and keep the same pace. I'm work every day until 10-11pm. I review operations completely and keep developing the partner network. Mid-March, I get bumped to Director of Business Development. I start getting results, but negotiations promise to take months.

End of March, the CEO announces there is no more money, out of nearly a million Swiss francs initial investment two years ago, and that salaries would not be paid. People quit, leaving just the CEO, his assistant and me. At this point, I am managing most the operational aspects of the firm while they look for funding. I never get a contract, not even an NDA.

Potential investors come and go, but nobody invests. Our developers and some service providers start freezing our accounts, but we continue more or less getting by operationally. I spend hours everyday in emergency meetings. Late May, the CEO cedes 1% of the company to me, but still no salaries. He starts complaining of having no money. Morale continues dropping.

End of June arrives and there's still no funding, so I inform the CEO and the Board that I am leaving. I explain that my savings have been used up and I have no other choice, even if I am a shareholder. A Rolls-Royce driving board member/investor advances my back salaries and a few thousand more for operations at the last moment though and my financial situation now stabilized, I continue working.

To cut costs, we leave our offices and start working from home. He fires the assistant. I am now the only employee aside from the CEO. He continually complains of being broke, accusing me of having money saved up and even hinting to me and the board that he's going to kill himself. He seems less and less stable. I continue working.

Then last Wednesday, I get a CCed email from him to the board, accusing me of working on the side and no longer being implicated in the company. I instantly deny it, explaining I'm still working nearly 12 hours a day. I show them the results. I go for a walk to calm down and when I get back he's left a message on my phone repeating his accusation and a couple of emails threatening to quit. The emails continue into the next day.

I send out an email the next day stating I can't work in these conditions and that I am stopping my current collaboration immediately. I offer to continue working if they can propose a reasonable a mandate with a minimal budget and well-defined scope.

That was last week. So far nothing but silence. I have no clue what's going on and I don't really care anymore. A real shame. I think it is the first startup I've worked for that is not gonna make it. I just wish I had been hired a year ago, back when they had money, when saving it would have been possible.

So, any other startup nightmare stories? :)

**TL;DR** Worked my way up from temp to employee #1 in startup that had nearly a million Swiss francs in initial investment and worldwide partners in six months. CEO mismanaged capital, went batshit crazy and I left.

&gt;&gt; In a relationship with fellow redditor, stanley_goodspeed (He got me started on reddit, so I have to give credit where credit is due).


## Favorites

&gt; Cats or Dogs? 
&gt;&gt; My family's always had cats - first Stinky, now it's Mittens. Mittens can really be a little jackass, but he's cool. I'd be lying if I said I've never posted his picture on reddit before. First chance I get after college, though, I'm adopting a dog.

&gt; Favorite beverage? 
&gt;&gt; Coffee. Then, it's diet caffeine-free pepsi (so I don't overload).

&gt; Food? 
&gt;&gt; I know what the username suggests, but I go through phases. Right now it's guacamole and sushi, but I've always had a particular weakness for ice cream. I'm lactose-intolerant, however, so it generally ends in a bad way. Hot fudge and marshmallow on top though, always.

&gt; Favorite movie? 
&gt;&gt; A favorite since childhood is The Iron Giant. I've never gotten sick of it.

&gt; Music? 
&gt;&gt; Just about everything, but it's hard for me to get on board with country.

&gt; Book? 
&gt;&gt; John Irving is hands down my favorite author. A Prayer for Owen Meany and The Cider House Rules are two of the best books I've ever read. I also love Vonnegut for a laugh. Hemingway's short stories are great, quick reads. I also like Stephen King's books that focus on the supernatural, rather than the scary, like Hearts in Atlantis or The Green Mile. I can't stand James Patterson, but I like other serial authors like John Grisham or Michael Crichton.

&gt; Game? 
&gt;&gt; I suck at games. I'm alright with Mario Kart and I talk big on Wii, but watching stanley_goodspeed play Halo is brutal (sorry). I'm also a lady though, so is anyone really surprised? I'll name a sport: tennis. I'm pretty good at tennis.

&gt; What is your favorite word or expression? 
&gt;&gt; ""Anything with the power to make you laugh over thirty years later isn't a waste of time. I think something like that is very close to immortality."" Stephen King


## Miscellanea

&gt; What makes you laugh? 
&gt;&gt; My dad and stanley_goodspeed. A lot of the time, inappropriate humor. Most recent example: my dad recently prank called a kid he knew who's running a football camp after seeing ads in the local newspaper. He pretended to be a mentally challenged, one-legged kid named Russell with $200 saved up who's ""mom said I should just play with the kids and play football with the kids."" I was crying laughing.

&gt; What is your biggest pet peeve? 
&gt;&gt; When things aren't clean or organized.

&gt; What general area of your country you live in? 
&gt;&gt; New England, grew up in Massachusetts

&gt; Do you love it? It's been great growing up. 
&gt;&gt; I love the seasons, especially fall. After attending college, though, I think I want to try and move down to the mid-Atlantic states and find work in the D.C. area.

&gt; What was the best thing about the last 12 months? 
&gt;&gt; Donating bone marrow. :) [My AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ckyj0/i_donated_bone_marrow_ama/).

&gt; What are you looking forward to in the next 12 months? 
&gt;&gt; Figuring out my life! I'm a senior at the University of Connecticut this September.

&gt; A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger? 
&gt;&gt; Probably registering as a bone marrow donor. I registered on a complete whim during freshman year of college. I actually registered out of pressure - a representative of a donor org asked me, face to face, and I felt bad saying no. I had no idea that I'd match an 8-year-old girl, or ever donate or ever have contact with the patient's family. It's been a crazy, emotional year, but I'll never, ever regret registering.

&gt; All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you? 
&gt;&gt; The people in my life.


## Concerning Reddit

&gt; What is the origin or meaning of your user name? 
&gt;&gt; Excuse my language, reddit, but I fuckin' love Fluff. And I've been known to put it on everything.

&gt; Total number of reddit identities you’ve had? 
&gt;&gt; This is it! I was a lurker before I made it.

&gt; What do you do when you’re not on reddit? 
&gt;&gt; Attend college, work at a gift store, intern for a political news website in Connecticut and see my friends.

&gt; Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so? 
&gt;&gt; I guess not. I've only been on for 7 months and I wasn't around for reddit's origins, so I'll leave that up to the experts. 


## Final Question

&gt; Is there anything else you'd like to mention? 

&gt;&gt; Yes! I don't know if you're sick of hearing it yet, but please consider registering as a bone marrow donor. The AMA that I linked to above explains a lot about the process and how to get involved, but I'm willing to answer any questions or address any concerns out there. You never know - you might be someone's one perfect match.

&gt;&gt; These donor organization websites offer a lot more information:

p.s. I have been thinking A+ but I've been hearing that its slowly becoming phased out/unnecessary. So I've been thinking the CCNA now, but I don't want to go through with a unhealthy decision.

My lease is up at the end of July (I live in Washington DC), and I'm starting a short internship in Montana on Labor Day.  I'm taking the month in between (and a couple weeks after) to see as much of the US as I can.

I have a rough itinerary planned out, based mostly around where I can stay with friends.  My trip is roughly a clockwise loop... starting in Boston, heading SW until I get to Texas.  Then west towards San Diego.  Finally, up the west coast to Portland and over to Montana where I'll work for two weeks.  After my two weeks is up, I'm driving back east towards Chicago.  Lots of question marks along that leg of the trip.

Anyway, I'd love suggestions for cool things to see / do.  I'm pretty aware of most of the popular tourist attractions (Rushmore, Yellowstone, Gateway Arch, etc.), and I've already got a big list of breweries to check out (I'm a giant beer geek.  Please suggest more), but anything that you find interesting I'd love to hear about.

Thanks."

I screwed up the first 2 years of college, but I made a huge comeback my 3rd year, so my GPA is finally at a 3.0. I'm trying to get it even higher by taking some summer classes, but that's not the point right now. My only work experience has been in the food service industry/cashier at your local grocery store. I know I'm capable of doing a job extremely well, but I have no idea where to start or look. I've already applied countless times online for places like Intel, AMD, Texas Instruments, and Lockheed Martin. It would be a dream come true to work for companies like those, but I fear my lack of experience and an average GPA are killing any chance I have.

But now, as several of my friends are going into internships of their own, I'm feeling kind of helpless and lost. I'm very shy, so I need a little push sometimes to get me in the right direction. I was hoping you guys could give me some pointers on how to find an internship and get my career life started."

Out of NOWHERE on Friday, he walks in the door and practically shouts that he wants to break up. We talked for a little after that, and the only reason he gave me was that his feelings changed.

crgcs,1,2010-07-19,To the government workers and nonprofit employees of Seattle: any tips on job-hunting in the government/non-profit sectors?,Basil-kun,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/crgcs/to_the_government_workers_and_nonprofit_employees/,"So, my boyfriend and I moved to Seattle in late March. My boyfriend landed a job as a video-game tester within two weeks of getting here. I, on the other hand, took several months of searching before I landed a temporary position as a clerk/auditor for a construction company.

Aside from the fact that this temp position will end soon, I am also concerned about the direction of my career path.

I graduated in May 2009 at the University of Minnesota with a Master's degree in Public Policy (similar to a Master's degree in Public Affairs at the University of Washington). So I have training. However, because I am new to Seattle, I have no connections that would get me a foot in the door into a government agency, or an international non-profit -- which is where I would ultimately like to build a career.

My skills: analyzing policy, statistics, fluency in Japanese and German, and writing. Boy, do I love to write.

My experience: Before getting this temp job, I volunteered once a week at the International Rescue Committee in Seattle. During grad school, I did a few internships (including a summer internship in a U.S. consulate in Germany). I have also plenty of customer service experience, as I worked as a waitress to save up for this big move.

I've sent in applications through USAjobs.gov and Seattle King County, but so far no luck. And nonprofits seem stuck with internal hiring. My advisors at the temp agencies have very little experience in hiring for those sectors.

I know I can *somehow* manage it. There are at least five alumni from my university who have made careers here. I've built a lasting contact with one; she sends me emails whenever there is a job opening at a nonprofit.

On the other hand, I admit that I am getting very nervous about not being able to use my Master's degree for pursuing my passion.

So, I humbly ask Seattleite redditors who work in government and nonprofits: any tips, suggestions, or even leads that you're willing to share?"

crudi,28,2010-07-20,Who is Jennifer Soares?,Prop19Warrior,prop19,https://www.reddit.com/r/prop19/comments/crudi/who_is_jennifer_soares/,"A line of argument I have seen gaining more traction over the last few days is being peddled by an attorney named Jennifer Soares.  Her arguments can be found on many of the No on 19 blogs and repeated in many comment sections even here on reddit.  Here are a couple of examples...

http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/2010/06/05/Why-You-Should-Vote-YES-California-Control-Tax-Cannabis-Initiative#comment-29899

http://votetaxcannabis2010.blogspot.com/2010/07/why-pro-pot-activists-oppose-2010-tax.html?showComment=1279437960986#c3869748808779970903

Here is her being referenced in our comments: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/Marijuana/comments/cpwp7/have_you_been_wondering_exactly_how_theyre_going/c0ukytl

I want to be clear that I think she is entitled to her opinion.  Everyone is and as a lawyer of course she can offer her opinion as a lawyer.  However, I want people to understand who she is and her background before running around and citing her as an expert.

The first thing to know about Ms. Soares is her background.  First, she graduated law school from *University of the Pacific* in 2009.  That's not a typo, she graduated law school last year.  She attended undergrad from 2002 - 2005 at UCal Davis.  The math on that is correct as well, she finished her BA in 3.3 years.  A point she seems to be very proud of.  

Before graduating she was an intern in the public defenders office.  

Why does her background matter?  Because she is offering opinions of legal theory and future interpretations.  She gets very defensive if you challenge her credentials and says things like...

""I simply claimed that 3 years of schooling and 8 months of practice gave me ample time to see the effect of prohibition and poorly written laws in the judicial system.""

I disagree.  The judicial decisions that matter are going to happen on an appellate level, not the trial court level.  She is not an appellate lawyer, she is a trial court lawyer.  

The second thing that is important to know about Ms. Soares is what she does now.  Currently according to her LinkedIn page she is working for herself.  Her line of work is medical marijuana.  Some items from LinkedIn:

-Law office specializing in medical cannabis and criminal defense representation.
""
Medical cannabis representation:
- drafting and filing corporation documents
- act as agent for service processes as well as agent for neighborhood complaints as required by many city ordinances
- draft, file, and represent clients in obtaining seller's permits, business licenses, and board of equalization permits
- represent clients during lease and/or employment negotiations
- representation of patients fighting city and/or county ordinances that limit access to medication
- legal training for employees of collectives/dispensaries
- mock raid training""

This screams conflict of interest.  If Prop 19 passes her business will be impacted.  With real legalization, many if not most of the people using the medical marijuana system in Cali will stop.  This means less need for her services.  

[LinkedIn Screencap](http://i.imgur.com/RpTrb.png)

tldr: Jennifer Soares is neither experienced nor objective enough for people to take seriously.  Stop feeding the troll who just wants to keep her payday coming.

**Edit 1:** You may also notice from her LinkedIn page that she is ""Chief Legal Counsel"" for VibeNation Multimedia.  A quick look into them shows the owner is Susan Soares.  Either that's a remarkable coinciedence or their is some nepotism going on.  

http://www.linkedin.com/pub/susan-soares/9/752/582

Also, here is the website for vibenation media... http://www.vibenationmultimedia.com/

**Edit 2:** [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/prop19/comments/crudi/who_is_jennifer_soares/c0urww0) is a comment from someone who says they went to school with her, along with their opinions on prop 19.

Is this normal?,mobius-n-stuff,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/crx7u/im_a_college_student_depressed_about_my_future_is/,"I've got one year of college left. I'm majoring in what is more or less film production. I've always wanted to make films, but honestly, for the last half a year or so I've been pretty depressed about it. 

Fall semester this past school year I was in Production 2. The next semester I wanted to get into an Immersion class where I would be making commercials for downtown businesses in the city, so I had to talk to the head of the project (also my advisor) about it and she asked me to bring her my reel.

I showed her what was I thought was the best thing on it, and she in so many words told me it wasn't very good, and that I should take Production 2 and try again. Maybe I just took that too hard.

I haven't done any internships because me/my family is far from loaded and I have to work in the summer to be able to afford school.

I have a friend who just this year got his shit together and moved out to Arizona, where he's already landing work on legit short film shoots and going to a school where the profs have worked on real features. 

I feel like I've wasted my time. I go to a state university, I wish I would've gone to a film school. I feel like I'm already way behind most of my classmates because I haven't done an internship and I can't get into any of the classes for people that are more skilled. I don't think I'm any good, I feel like I've wasted my college education on a pipe dream, and I'm wishing I would've just gone to school for generic shit so I could've landed some crappy office job after college. I am pretty depressed that I am just going to spend the rest of my life working in the factory I currently work at as a summer job.

Feels like all I have to look forward to is alcoholism.

Am I just being stupid?

TL;DR I feel like I suck and I've wasted my time in college and I'm not going to amount to anything in life."
cs69a,9,2010-07-21,I have made the biggest mistake of my life,halluz,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cs69a/i_have_made_the_biggest_mistake_of_my_life/,"I have been reading Reddit for a long time but this is my first post so.. go easy.

The short story is this: I dated my dream girl in college.  We dated for 2.5 years then I broke up with her as I was moving across the country for 3 months to do an internship.  In short, that was the biggest mistake of my life (breaking up with her, not the internship).  Fast forward 2 months to today: we're talking pretty frequently and for whatever reason she still loves me.  I'm still at my internship and I will be coming home in about a month.  Only in the past couple of days, however, did I truly realize what I had done to her when I broke up with her, and how truly incredible it is that she is still talking to me, and even more than that, saying that she still loves me.  

Before you all post ""you're an idiot for breaking up with her"" or ""you're stupid you deserve what you get"", I want to agree with those statements.  It was easily the worst decision I have ever made in my life, and I was unaware how much I took her for granted and how stupid I was being at the time.  I can't believe I couldn't see how much she loved and cared for me, and how blinded I was by my own selfish thoughts.  I've been battling with this whole situation in my mind all summer but only recently have I been able to really see it from her angle and know how terrible and selfish I have been.

I don't understand why she is still talking to me or how she could still love me after I have broken her heart, but she does, and I feel absolutely wretched for doing that to her, and I do still love her too.  Here's where the situation gets a little sticky.  Her dad absolutely hates me now.  He didn't like me before, but now he completely hates me, and for good reason.  He won't listen to anything she has said to him about us and refuses to be rational.  This leads to my two-part question:

How can I show her that I am genuinely sorry for what I did and that I feel absolutely terrible and I do love her in a way that isn't contrived or cliche, and **(more of the main question I seek to Ask Reddit), How do I deal with her dad?**

TL;DR: I broke up with my girlfriend, which was a mistake and now she still loves me but her dad hates me.  How do I deal with him?"

Here's what he sent me:

""Dude, Bill Murray is nuts. So bloomberg's latest scheme to make nyc money is dumpster pools and as a joke letterman wanted one for the show. Murray sees it and wants to jump in. So he does. Doesn't tell us that he's doing it. He disappears, everyone in the studio is looking for him, going nuts. Finally biff (stage manager biff henderson) sends me outside to see if he's there with fans and all I see is bill murray swimming in a dumpster. He splashes me. I go inside legit soaked. And a camera crew goes outside and makes him recreate it. Later after his interview he comes up to me in a bathrobe and says ""I'm sorry, but comic timing prevails, too bad there wasn't a fucking camera there to tape it."" I couldn't speak. Then he signed a dollar bill and gave it to me!""

He's sending me a picture of the bill tomorrow, his boss held onto it for the day. Apparently the recreation of Murray doing a belly flop into a dumpster of water and trash will be aired tonight along with an interview.

csgm3,1,2010-07-22,"Hi, Reddit! I might be planning the trip of a lifetime and would love some suggestions, advice and anecdotes regarding backpacking, Turkey and the Caucasus.",ItsAnotherThrowaway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/csgm3/hi_reddit_i_might_be_planning_the_trip_of_a/,"I'm a half-Spanish half-British male in my early 20s. I will hopefully finish the equivalent of my BSc in february next year, and will therefore have at least 6 months of spare time covering the end of winter, spring and summer until I start a master's degree.  After much deliberation on whether to try and get an internship or a job for that period I've decided to screw it and travel.
Please don't be put off by all the specific questions.  I'll value a general idea of what to expect when backpacking and any random recommendations you might have as much as specific answers.

I live and study in Spain, and I was planning to combine backpacking around Turkey and maybe other countries in the area (Azerbaijan? Armenia? Iran?? Georgia???), and more conventionally a 30 day Interrail trip around most of Europe.

As far as the Interrail goes, I figure Western and Central Europe will be no problem. I'm not a huge traveller but I've been around and lived there for a while. On the other hand, I would love it if anyone who's been around could give some general guidelines for Eastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria, ex-Yugoslavia, Romania, etc, particulary with regards to hostelling, hospitality, communicability in English and warnings, if any.

Anyway, Europe shouldn't be a big problem. I'm slightly more concerned about Eastern Turkey and other places. I've been to Istanbul and other places in Western Turkey, and have some friends from there (who I will no doubt consult also). However, Turkey is a large country with huge contrasts between the moderately liberal cities and West and the more oriental and conservative interior. Even my Turkish friends admit never having been East of Ankara, and mostly ignore the lifestyle and culture of eastern Anatolian villages.

I can speak a few words and very simple sentences in Turkish, and will no doubt start intensely studying to brush it up to a decent level. There goes my first set of concrete questions:

+ Do you know any good resources to learn Turkish, or maybe a good Turkish Reddit clone or forum?

+ How likely is it to find cheap accomodation in Eastern Turkey outside of the cities like Trabzon and Erzurum? Would you consider it safe to sleep out in a sleeping bag (assuming it isn't winter, of course)

+ Would visiting the Kurdish areas be a big no-no or can a European backpacker get around being careful? I don't know if I should be more scared of PKK or the [village guards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_guard_system)

+ In the Kurdish areas, would learning some basic Kurdish expressions (_""Hello"", ""Thank you"", ""How do I get to..."", ""I'm fucking hungry""_) be of any advantage, even if only to get along better with the people?

OK, enough about Turkey. My second level ambition would be to also visit certain states in the area. I know the border with Armenia is closed, so I wouldn't be able to go directly. Azerbaijan would be very nice as well, but visiting Iran and getting down to Tehran too would simply be epic. My questions...

+ Do you think I'm insane?

+ Are Iranians as incredibly hospitable and friendly as I've heard they are? Would learning some Persian (above phrasebook level) be necessary?

+ Apparently Azeri is close enough to Turkish to be mutually intelligible for native speakers. Am I too optimistic in believing I could get along in Azerbaijan and Northern Iran if my Turkish was good enough?

+ Are there any problems crossing borders in that area? Would I be likely to come across border patrols or police who might require ""a little extra on the side"" to let me through?

+ Is a Turkish/Armenian stamp on my passport any trouble for getting into Armenia/Turkey?

+ Any important considerations for a European male in these areas? I'm dark haired, and not too fair skinned, and I could probably pass for Iranian, Turkish or whatever if it weren't for the huge backpack on me.

In more general terms, I have a few more questions you might be able to answer:

+ Anything non-obvious which would be useful to a backpacker?

+ I was thinking of carrying a crappy second hand netbook with _loads_ of files, maps, etc which might come in handy. What do you think? Risky or smart?

And finally, more philosophical questions:

+ I'm atheist. Do you think, _if the subject were to come up,_ it would be smarter to identify myself as Christian or be sincere and say I'm non-religious? I think a Muslim might find a Christian less offensive than an _atheist_, but would diplomatically saying I'm _not religious_ be OK?

+ I have a Spanish and a British passport (veeery illegal in Spain, that's the only reason I'm using a throwaway). Which should I use? I can see advantages and disadvantages to both: the Spanish one is more likely to be positively received (nobody hates Spain), but I think the British one is more likely to get official respect (cue screaming _""You can't do this! I'm an̶ A̶m̶e̶r̶i̶c̶a̶n̶ British Citizen!""_).

As I said before, please don't be put off by specific questions you might not be able to answer. I will welcome any suggestion or experience you might have had, in any area of the World.

cshom,1514,2010-07-22,I have a simple idea for reddit to make money but I can't get them to listen.  Many of you liked my idea so please help me make reddit listen.,joeasian,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/cshom/i_have_a_simple_idea_for_reddit_to_make_money_but/,"[I posted the idea here first](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/croqe/i_gladly_donated_to_reddit_but_i_wont_pay_for_it/c0uqmdg) which was well received.

The idea...

Create a 'support reddit' page with a list of merchants and their affiliate links so that when I do plan on buying something at Amazon or Newegg, I can click through the link and reddit gets a small referral fee.

I envision a page of merchant links similar to this [Upromise's store and services page](http://shop.upromise.com/mall/view-all-companies) but with much less merchants. No sign-up necessary. It should not take more than 2 sec. to click-through. Clicking through the links would be entirely discretionary. This would be like a small donation to reddit every time you shop but with no out of pocket cost to you.

----

**edit:**  Some of you think this would go against the terms of affiliates.  I'm not suggesting reddit become an affiliate with every online store but with stores that redditors frequent.  reddit should also state that one should click on the affiliate link only if you found something interesting to buy through reddit.

**edit2:**  I had the admins open [/r/shopping](http://www.reddit.com/r/shopping) to post deals, suggestions, product reviews, etc.  I was hoping to have the 'support reddit' page created before promoting the subreddit.

**edit3:**  I did talk to an admin 6 months ago with this idea and he liked the idea at first and started signing up with affiliate programs. Every week I would pester him to create the 'support reddit' page. He mentioned the call for interns was in part to support this new endeavor. Then it sort of died down.  Perhaps his attention turned to reddit gold.

**last and final edit (hopefully):** hoodatninja brought up a good point.  An admin is listening but isn't implementing. I've asked him many times that if he thinks my idea is stupid then tell me to stfu. He keeps reassuring me that the idea is good and that he's working on it but gets distracted by the many fires that he has to put out.

**I was hoping by doing this post that the admins can get some feedback from the reddit community on my idea. The overall consensus so far seems to be positive.  I can't imagine the cost of implementing the 'support reddit' page being that high.**"

I need some ""feet on the ground"" info about Hong Kong.  Or maybe just someone with better Google-Fu than I currently possess.  I need to find a street address in HK and a florist who speaks English.  Allow me to explain....


A short while ago, I met a great girl... gorgeous, funny, smart, similar family to mine, same values, etc.  Really a perfect package.  I'm totally smitten.  We've been openly flirting for weeks and we're talking about dating.  However, with my luck, just a short while after we met, she flew off to Hong Kong for a 10 week internship and we've been stuck communicating over the intarwebz.  Needless to say, I'd like to do something a bit more tangible.


I would REALLY like to surprise her by having a bouquet of her favorite flowers delivered to her office.  She has a hard-ass for a boss and I know they would cheer her up something huge.  I've spent a fair amount of time searching and all my googling has only yielded addresses for the main offices in Beijing ( [Link 1](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/static/contactus.html) and [Link 2](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/static_e/Contact_Us.html) ) and I certainly can't ask her for her work address without raising complete suspicion and ruining the surprise.  


She is working in the HK office of The China Daily newspaper.    Anyone think they can help me find the street address of that office?


And then of course, once I can find the address, I need to find a florist who speaks English and will take Paypal (I'm not sure I can trust giving my CC number to a purported florist in Asia.  That's asking for bad news).


So Reddit, think we can make this happen?  I'll be forever indebted to you."

I've been looking at Americorps' website, and I think the NCCC or VISTA programs look like a good fit for me. However, I feel like I'm only seeing it from one perspective on their website. What's the program like? Is it strict or more relaxed? What can I bring? What can't I bring? Will it be hard to stay in contact with family and friends? Are there major consequences if it turns out I'm just not ready for something like this and need to leave? Do most schools/employers recognize and appreciate Americorps service? Will they let me see a psychiatrist and/or therapist, either on my own healthcare plan or their plan (whichever is cheaper)? How selective are they? Would they consider my issues with depression a reason not to take me, or triumph over adversity? Anything else I should consider?

As a 21 year old who has only lived in a college dorm and with his family, 10 months far away sounds like a big step. However, my life is in idle. I can't get a legitimate job in my area in the current economy (no retail experience), and the work I do get is fixing computers under the table.

I'm considering Americorps in addition to Dynamy (gap-year internship program) and getting an internship on my own, but right now I'm filling out apps for all three. Americorps sounds gratifying in a way that a traditional internship would not be, which sounds good for the world, and good for my depression. However, all three would help me get my work ethic back."

I'm about to go into my senior year of high school, and I have a gf there I really want to go as well.  Is there anything I can do to increase my chances of getting in right now?  I'm worried because my GPA is only about a 93 and sophomore/freshmen year I didn't do so well in math or classes in general.  In junior year in AP Calc BC ( I'm two years advanced in math), I got a 96 average, and a 96 average for the year for all classes.  Will low math scores this prevent me from getting into CalTech?

Outside of classes I'm also in Science Olympiad, Science Bowl, I have built a few robots for Science Olympiad and won a few events, built websites for the school, and gone to CTY in computer science a few years.  I also develop Android applications with another kid under the name IDKJava, and we've been fairly successful with that, and I have an internship as a programmer.  Will this be able to balance out my bad grades?

Also another question, should I put down sport related stuff to an application to MIT or CalTech?  I've heard that they don't want well-rounded kids and I've been to states in swimming and this may make me seem like less of a geek which may be bad (?)

Anyways, are there any CalTech students/graduates who could help answer my questions?

tl;dr:  How do I get into CalTech?  Would bad grades in two years advanced math prevent entry?"

Let's do this.",andon,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ct521/alright_fittit_ive_got_three_weeks_lets_do_this/,"I've got three weeks until my girlfriend gets back from Lebanon.  She's been gone all summer visiting her brother and working on an internship, while I've been here trying to renovate the house and renovate myself before she gets back.    Here's the rub:  

I'm 5'11""-6' tall (depending on who's measuring,) I weigh (as of this afternoon,) 153.5lbs., and my body fat percentage is around 15.5% according to my Weight Watchers ConAIR scale (I'm not doing Weight Watchers, but it seemed like the best scale, unless anyone has any other suggestions - which I'm completely open to.)  If my scale is to be believed, I've lost somewhere around 14lbs. since the beginning of the summer, mainly through going to the gym at least three times a week, cycling, running, and eating less overall (summer has that effect on me.)  

I've also been a martial arts instructor (I have a black belt, but I haven't taught in a while,) and I used to skateboard religiously back in the day, so I've always kept fairly fit, or at least tried to.  As of recent I've worked up to running a full 5k at a time, usually in about 25 minutes or so.  I do body weight exercises (pull-ups, chin-ups, dips, etc.,) as well as squats and a few other things depending what I want to do.  Blah blah blah, here's my question:  

If I'm looking to drop to about or slightly below 10% body fat in the next three weeks, what's the best way to go about doing so, if it's even realistically possible?  Depending on my body fat percentage daily, that means anywhere from about 8-10lbs of fat that needs to be lost.  I should mention that I try and keep abreast of fitness literature, read /r/fitness daily, etc. as much as possible and so I know there is a difference between weight loss and fat loss, so I'm trying to approach this from all sides.  I also know that this is - given that the stars align - fairly realistic if I commit to it.  

So, what's the best way to do this?  Low carb/ketosis seems to be the most obvious choice, but I'm open to all options.  Should I up my 5k runs from three times daily to five or so times a week, while keeping my weight training at three days a week?  I'm fairly well built  (at least to where I'm happy,) so cutting I guess would be priority number one, I suppose.  

The best advice will be strictly adhered to, and I will update weekly (every Friday until the 13th, when she gets back.)  

[Here's me](http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs196.snc4/38163_633588736371_44011957_35595907_3334305_n.jpg).

Give me your best, /r/fittit, and thanks for reading this rambling.  

**TL;DR** I'm 5'11""-6', weigh 153.5 and have a body fat percentage of around 15.5% (if my scale is to be believed.)  How do I cut down to 10% or less body fat in three weeks?  This means losing roughly 8-10lbs.

**EDIT:** I am not dead set on losing this exact amount, etc.  I just want to know what I could/should do in the next three or so weeks to get closer to that goal.  Some pictures were also added [here](http://i.imgur.com/qCCfn.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/VnVWo.jpg).  

Also, the low/no carb/ketosis route seems to be the most likely way - thus far - to do this.  With that in mind, I need an exit strategy.  How do I go from two to three weeks of this regimen back to maintenance (for example,) without yo-yoing back to where I am now?  Any advice is greatly appreciated."
cta8s,2,2010-07-24,"Reddit, I'm going through a rough transition period immediately following college. Thankfully, I have very supportive parents, but they use God as a reason for their stability.

As someone who wants to do music journalism as a career, I couldn't be in a better position. Now, with my internship ending soon, I've chosen to stay in the city to pursue my dreams, hopefully using the contacts I've made as a springboard into a paid position. However, my sublease is almost up, and I need to find an apartment in August. This means signing a lease for a long period of time without really knowing my future income. Basically, it's a huge leap of faith and stressing the hell out of me.

I have wonderful parents who've supported me all summer, loaning me money for rent/living expenses that I will one day pay back. Last night, I got very stressed out while chatting with my dad about the situation on Skype -- just feeling overwhelmed with the all the uncertainty ahead of me. He felt it, too.

Today, he sent me a great email in support of my decision making, and quite honestly, reading it brought on a few tears. However, here's my dilemma/question. In the email, he cited his faith in God as something that helped him through tough times -- times similar to mine. He said that after our stressful conversation last night, he was pretty down but after ""talking with the Almighty,"" felt an enormous amount of peace.

So, this brings me to my frustration. Why can't I approach life this simply? I don't write ""simply"" to make my dad seem uneducated or blind because of his faith (he's a very wise man), I just can't bring myself to believe that God can take care of everything and provide peace so quickly or so easily. But the thing is, I want to believe that. I just can't. I don't know why. I just can't.

Why do I have to question everything? How do others handle stressful situations like this? Do any other non-believers/agnostic/atheists wish they could just believe in God sometimes?

**TL;DR**: I'm stressed. My dad said he looks to God in these situations. My faith is messy/I don't really believe in God. Do other non-believers/agnostics/atheists find themselves wishing they could believe in God, but something inside won't let them?

**EDIT**: I feel I need to say that my dad was not saying ""this is all part of the plan"" or ""it will all work out."" It was more just, ""hey, this worked for me, try it if you want."" I also should note that he was very clear that ""this doesn't mean you can sit back and let God take care of everything. You have to put in all the effort yourself.""

**EDIT 2**: Yeah, you guys are right. After having some time to relax and calm down a bit, I need to gain a bit of perspective. Focusing a little bit too much on my ""first world problem."" Thanks."

Yet, there was no way I could walk out the door in shorts. I was deformed. Hideous. The masses would recoil in fear at the sight of my gnawed legs.

Bed bugs.



Until somewhere around the 20th bite, I was unaware that bed bugs actually existed outside of the common mantra for tucking children in at night:

""Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite!""

I'd like to know: what sick person decided that this was an appropriate part of their child's night time routine?

""Good night, sleep tight, don't let the flesh-shredding, blood-sucking parasites that are crawling all over your mattress latch onto that vulnerable, snoring bag of hemoglobin, otherwise known as your body, tonight!""

Scratching yet?

I was. My nightly routine as an intern was to come back to Brooklyn after a long workday, sweating through my jeans, strip naked in the bathroom and scratch like a flea-ridden mutt for twenty minutes while sobbing incoherently over the phone to Andrew about how I'd just have to sleep in the tub tonight because rubber-banding my socks over my pants and sleeping on an air mattress sealed with a plastic zipper bag in the middle of the kitchen was still no defense against these thirsty. mother. fucking. bugs.

The two girls who subleased the apartment to my roommates and me bragged about how they'd gotten all of their furnishings at a great price: For free! From the oh-so-sterile curbs of our Brooklyn neighborhood!

""You'd be amazed at what people throw out!"" they gushed after we'd already paid and signed on the dotted line.

'Amazed' wasn't the adjective I had in mind as I piled my entire wardrobe into the dryer to burn off any existing parasites before storing it all in garbage bags, which I would live out of for the remainder of my summer internship.

It hadn't taken more than one or two Google searches to find out that the apartment contained bed bugs.

During my search, I learned of the mind-fuckingly disturbing characteristics of the bed bug.

Here are some fun facts:

1. Bed bugs typically live in--you guessed it--BEDS!, but also infiltrate other furniture.
2. They feast on blood, first anesthetizing their victims with their spit, then sucking out life juice to their hearts' content.
3. They are dark red/ brown in color because they're full of your blood.
4. They communicate to other bedbugs through the use of pheromones: ""Hey guys, this twit passed out drunk and won't be waking for another 12 hours! Open bar to raid! Dibs on the aorta!""
5. When temperatures are colder, some bedbugs can survive for up to a year without eating. A year. I can't survive for more than 2 hours without tossing food to my gullet monster.
6. Bed bugs molt out of their skin at least 6 times before reaching fertile adult hood. Fucking. Sick.
7. Shells of their bodies, as well as their iron-laden blood poop, sink into your mattress, creating a visible brown line on the side: one of the clearest indications of infestation...aside from tiny blood smears on your sheets...yum.
8. Male bedbugs impregnate female bedbugs NOT by gentle woo'ing and tender love-making, but rather by stabbing them in the torso with razor sharp genitalia and depositing semen. ""You want kids? I'll give you kids... Ahhhhhhh! I. AM. SPARTACUUUUUUS!""
9. There has been a resurgence of bedbugs in NYC since gene mutations promoted the flourishing of pesticide-resistant bedbugs. This means that many can survive a bath of toxic chemicals as though it was nothing more than an aggressive facial.
10. One of the only surefire ways to kill bedbugs is to expose them to heat that's 115°F for no shorter than 7 minutes. (Aka--putting your clothes in the dryer...hence living out of sealed garbage bags.)
11. Because of international travelers from countries with less-expansive health department regulations, these little creatures are often stowaways and are making increasing visits to many Big City, USA hotels. They only ever come with one-way tickets.

In summary, bed bugs are hideous, opportunistic, impermeable assholes that make it their business to feast on the most vulnerable subjects: sleeping humans. And there's not a whole lot you can do to stop them.

That's how the psychosis sets in. By the 3rd month of being feasted on every night and waking up every morning with 20 new bites, I was losing my mind. The exterminators had been in an out with no results, pest bombs had no effect, I had spent weeks obsessively drying my clothes and thereby only having a handful that still fit, and Andrew had begun, weeks prior, to expect a phone call around the same time every day from his hyperventilating girlfriend. My body was riddled with old bite wounds and new bite marks. My legs were so ravaged, it took the better part of a year for the scars to fade.

The bedbug: a tiny creature with the immense capability of upsetting some primal balance within. It's a humbling and downright fucking miserable experience. I was lucky to escape the situation in one piece (minus a few hundred flesh nibblets), but it's instilled in me a paranoia of hotel floors, old mattresses and any piece of furniture salvaged from the curb.

I think my parents would be ok with me coming out. When I was 16 my dad gave me a talk about how one of his friends was gay and did not come out untill he was 30 and it ruined his life. Never had any other conversations about it with him.

Anyway, I've been a severe closet case. I really enjoy thinking about guys and girls. I realized a few weeks ago that I am indeed bisexual. I've always been effeminate. Sex with girls is great, but I've noticed I lust for intelligence within men. Does anyone else feel this way?

Anyway, I attend a university and I'm afriad that my coming out would negatily affect how people treat me. I'm in an engineering dicipline program in a smaller community. Also I graduate next year. I have an internship and I'm also concerned how I should approach this situation. It's a smaller town (20,000 people or so) and word gets around here. I'm not ashamed of who I am anymore, which is something that has made me feel better than ever. 

Are my fears unfounded?

ctkbc,4,2010-07-25,Right-Wing antigay conservative judicial candidates who failed to win in San Diego whine about how they should not have been rated on their lack of judicial experience,FatherAzerun,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/ctkbc/rightwing_antigay_conservative_judicial/,"Right Wing ""Better Courts Now"" Candidates whine to the San Diego Reader (ComicCon issue) how unfair it is that the San Diego County Bar association should not rate them based on their relative lack of judicial or legal experience.

Among his pithy quotes stands out the paragraph on the foundations for better Courts Now and it's Proposition 8 origins:

Better Courts Now proclaims, “Good judges understand that independence of the courts does not mean independence from the voters. It’s as simple as ABC.” According to the Better Courts website, the operative terms are “Accountability,” “Boundaries,” and “Common Sense” — attributes that the challengers apparently believe many San Diego judges lack. Candelore, who ran under the leitmotif of “restoring people’s trust and confidence in our courts,” highlighted the “ABC” theme in his own campaign materials, which are nearly identical to those posted online at Better Courts Now. I asked him to elaborate. “Accountability,” he said, is about the process of electing judges, which, he contends, has devolved into nothing more than a pro forma rubber-stamping of incumbents, a presumption that sitting judges will, barring extraordinary circumstances, maintain their seats on the local bench. “Boundaries,” Candelore told me, means that judges will eschew judicial activism, leave lawmaking to the legislators, and respect the Constitutionally mandated separation of powers. As for “common sense,” he defined it as “practical wisdom” and “real-world experience.” “It means you’ve lived.”

But the best is the paragraph including one of the candidates' discussion of the following:

""Craig Candelore . . . lamented that, for most, the road to local jurisprudence has led from law school and the district attorney’s office, without a stop in the 'real world.' He groused, 'None of them have ever run a business.'"" He also says that by being a soldier in Iraq it helped bring courts to Iraq. 

By that logic:

I WANT TO BE A BRAIN SURGEON.  I think brain surgeons have spent too much time in medical school then gone directly into internships and hospitals.  They need more real life experience.  None of these so-called ""brain surgeons""  have spent time in the real world, say, delivering pizza or engaging people as telemarketers! And since I am a teacher (not in a field related to biology, mind you), I have helped fight to bring education to people to use their brains and train to become doctors, so surely that qualifies me!

Where can I get a discount on a good saw?

I went to a so-so school in Boston and struggled until April. I've been trying to find a job in something that relates to video, and has the potential to become a job where I get some creative input. Boston seemed to be a city catering towards the sports crowd, which I know nothing about.

 After running out of money I had to move home to Maine where I got a job as a garde manger. It only lasted a few months until I got into a fight with the chef, because he was a complete asshole. I was able to save up about 1200. 

I'm really big into gaming and would love to get into the game industry. My dream job would be a Cinematic director/writer. I would still love a video/film job, if I was offered a job.  

I have a strong portfolio and a pretty good resume. I did an internship working for the director of a film festival. I'm not sure why I've had such bad luck here, while some of my lazier graduating class hasn't.

I was wondering if you think my problem is Maine? If so, do you think I should move to the west coast where gaming, video and film jobs are more plentiful? Or maybe, I should try Toronto? And do you think 1200 is enough money to make the move? I live a pretty cheap life, In Boston my monthly expenses were about 400 a month. 

Also, I've been sending about 10 to 15 resumes out a month for jobs like QA tester, video intern, camera man, video editor, etc... No luck.

Need some help.,schwann,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ctm46/intern_at_a_shoe_factory_in_china_need_some_help/,"For reasons that involve 1) wanting to do something other than screw around over the summer 2) beer (not enough of it) 3) temporary insanity, I signed up for an internship program that sends Taiwanese students to Taiwanese manufacturers/companies in China over the summer. I was assigned to a footwear manufactory. 

I have been here for about a week (the internship lasts for about 6 weeks). So far they have had me doing a bunch of translations and stuff for their website and a few other documents. My direct superior is the secretary of the CEO. Since they had only set up a hasty, temporary workspace for me and this other intern in her office, we see the CEO every now and then. He even takes the time to drop in and chat with us a little bit from time to time. Considering how busy he is, I hugely appreciate it. 

Towards the end of the week, he set me and the other intern an assignment of sorts, since he didn’t feel like we were really in a position to learn anything. This past week or so, I have essentially been a Chinese-to-English drone. The CEO asked us to make two presentations about the company: one to clients/potential clients; the other to investors.

I’m not entirely clueless about this assignment and I have a rough idea on where to start. The problem is, I don’t know how to make it awesome. Personally, I’m more perplexed by the investor presentation. 

* How do I convince investors that investing in this footwear manufactory is more worthwhile when compared to all the other opportunity costs out there? 

* I have the annual report for the company, including a bunch of their consolidated accounting documents. I’ve already jotted down a bunch of stuff like net profit, revenue, dividend per share, and net asset value per share, but what else should I be squeezing from the annual report?

* What the hell do investors look for when selecting an investment in manufacturing?

ctp6e,5,2010-07-26,LD and he's ignoring me..?,ooocool,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ctp6e/ld_and_hes_ignoring_me/,"We're both 21, been together for two years now. We're in a long distance relationship right now since I'm taking the summer in Asia to do some internships and hang out with my family and he's back in our hometown taking summer classes. 

I've only left for a few weeks, but it seems like as soon as I was out the door he's had parties every single week or every few days. I don't really mind any of that at all, I encourage him to enjoy being with friends and meeting people while I'm gone. I also know the people he hangs out with, we're all friends, and I they're a decent group of people. I also feel confident in our relationship. All I really ask for is that we set up a time every two days or so to video chat and talk. If video chat isn't possible or we keep missing each other, I ask that he at least send me a email so I know he's alive and well. 

I find that I'm always the one waiting. Waiting for him to finish being with his friends, waiting for him to log on, waiting for him to come back from a party. When we don't speak for a few days, he finally sends an email, usually one or two lines. I'm not picky about the length, it's amazing that he sends me an email at all. 

I waited for him today for four hours because he said he would be on in one hour. After four hours, he went online for about five minutes to tell me that he had decided to go out and hang with our friends for the night, even though it's already almost midnight where he is, and he has work the next day early in the morning. I got a little upset, but said forget it and told him to go have fun, but I can't help feeling like I'm always the one waiting around.

And when I get upset, he doesn't make any attempt to assuage my feelings. Just says something curt like ""Okay well bye."" 

Usually, we have a good strong serious relationship. Rarely we have some mild passive aggressive communication mishaps, but they're only on occasion and as soon as they're resolved we go back to just being a happy couple. 

I'm not sure if ""ignoring me"" is the right term, but I don't think he's considering my feelings. And I feel like he's not the best at managing his time or being accountable for his times. One time he said he'd be in a meeting for five minutes and told me to wait for him, and ended up being an hour during which he didn't pick up my calls or respond to my texts asking if I should just come back later.

I'm posting this on RA because I'm feeling pretty blue and I don't know what to do. Waiting makes me feel pretty pathetic. I do go out with my friends here and enjoy myself maybe once a week, just dinners and stuff, nothing crazy.

I kind of want to just say fuck it. He can come look for me when he wants to talk, and screw our nearly non-existent schedule. Is that me being emotional?

Okay, RA. Do your worst."
ctq9i,2,2010-07-26,"I am a college student, and I was recently accepted into Americorps NCCC. Should I take the opportunity, or stay in school? Advice greatly appreciated",ithasfourtoes,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ctq9i/i_am_a_college_student_and_i_was_recently/,"Hey reddit, here's my situation:
I started college in fall of last year, and will therefore be a sophomore in college this coming fall. My first year wasn't exactly great, but it could have been worse, I suppose. Ultimately, I simply should have spent more time and effort in the college decision process.

Anyway, my dissatisfaction with the first year of college and my wanderlust/sense of adventure led me to apply for Americorps NCCC for Fall 2010 (October 2010 - July 2011). The program seems like a great experience, and one I know is perfect for me. If you haven't heard of NCCC, here's a [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Civilian_Community_Corps). 

Here's my dilemma: My first year in school was disappointing, but also a big time learning experience. I took a while to adjust, but now feel I may be more prepared to enjoy the experience, or at least get more out of it. I built a great foundation for myself (3.81 gpa, club participation, great teacher relationships, and some good friends, and opportunities for study abroad and internships in a couple years), and always flourish in situations once I'm adjusted. A part of my wants to keep going on my path and wait to do Americorps until later.
However, another part of me would kill to do it now. It's an amazing opportunity, and I know it would make me a better person, with greater wisdom, experience, etc. I love the thought of taking that risk, going on that adventure, being the kind of person who will truly fully live out his life and callings. I want to be that person. It's perfect for me, and I'd hate to pass up on this chance. I could always reapply at a later time, but there's no guarantee I would again be accepted (they use random selection of screened and approved applicants).

What should I do? Stay in school and wait to do it later? Or take the opportunity of a life time? Do I play it safe and wait, or go for the gold NOW?
Has anyone here taken a year off from school for whatever reason? What was it like? What did you do? Was it hard to return to school? Did you feel like you ended up a year behind your peers (that's a big fear of mine)?

Also, any redditors from Sacramento here? That's where I was accepted to serve. What's the city like?

Longshot: has anyone here done Americorps NCCC? Can anyone relate to my experience/decision in any way?

PLEASE help me out reddit. I'm unsure of what to do, and could use your insight and thoughts. Thanks!"

He purses his lips to the side. ""I see here you know a little about Linux. What's your preferred distribution?""

""That's a tough decision, really. I've tried Slackware, openSUSE, different flavors of Debian and Ubuntu."" I scratch my freshly-shaven chin. ""Of all of them, I would definitely say I prefer Ubuntu. The ease of setup and out-of-the-box functionality allows me to focus on more important things, like working on my projects.""

His jaw twitches. ""Okay. Thanks for the resume and your interest. We'll give you a call later on.""

He smiles; I smile. I shake his hand, and walk away.

Six months later and no phone calls. I accept an internship with a different company, developing a web application for IE6, using ActiveX to connect to an Access DB client-side.To a point, I'm unhappy.

If a potential employer asks what your favorite Linux distribution is, should you be worried?

Me: ""Ubuntu.""

Showed it to my parents when I got home and ended up going to the ER only to be sent back home. The dumb nurse was pointing to imaginary spots on my arm and said it was probably a spider bite. Gave me two shots of blood thinner in my stomach while telling me I was chubby so I had no reason to be scared of the huge needles… but I digress. Went home and came back the following Monday for an ultrasound of the arm, they found nothing and tried sending me home. Dad threw a fit and I ended up back in the ER to get a CT scan. CT showed Deep Vein Thrombosis in my shoulder. That's when they immediately started treating me like a glass doll and wouldn't let me move at all (Which annoyed me very bad considering I had to pee really bad. They ended up transporting me via ambulance to a different hospital because they couldn't help me at the one I was already at. Let me tell you, ambulance ride on the freeway whilst strapped to a board when you have to pee is NOT fun.) Stayed at the hospital for a week. Ended up being put on blood thinners for 9 months. Clot broke up into smaller pieces and moved onto other veins. 

Fast forward to a year later and I started getting a tingling sensation in my left side. Back to the hospital. Needed a spinal tap done. A spinal tap alone is horrible, but I had an intern doing mine and that was the worst experience of my life so far. I ended up having them try, meaning I got stabbed, 4 times. Spinal tap confirmed Multiple Sclerosis. Hospital stay was a week, as well.

I'm 18 now, and I've had no further blood problems however my MS isn't doing so well. Ask Away."

* Best time to see animals is early mornings and late evenings because its cooler and they don't lose much energy from scorching heat.

* Best place to find animals is Lamar and Hayden valley, again during early mornings and late evenings.

* Bison's are the most dangerous animals in Yellowstone, because they are really unpredictable and abundant. They look tame but can really surprise you sometimes. Pro-tip : they hate red color, motorbikes and loud noisy diesel vehicles.

* Fishing is pretty waste of time as there are lot of restrictions on what can be used as baits. Most importantly: No live baits.

* You can have a summer job at Yellowstone. You will get paid to see the wild Mother Nature. There are lot of teenagers from various places working there. ( I am rethinking my Microsoft internship next year for this minimum pay opportunity)

* ASK ASK ASK. The rangers are really friendly. They will give all of their years experience happily. You can tell how they all love their jobs. Don't forget to ask the Wolf watchers with amazing scopes. They are also really friendly and offer a peak through their scopes.

* Don't forget the hikes around the Lower Falls. Its really worth it.

* Don't forget to check out the amazing geysers and hot springs. Yellowstone is sitting on one of the worlds biggest **active** volcano.

* Most importantly, STAY SAFELY AWAY FROM WILD LIFE. Mostly they don't care, unless you start getting closer.

* If you can't spot animals, look for rangers. There will always be a ranger around rare animal sightings or big herds.

I feel as though getting a master's right away is smart, but I believe I would feel a significant amount of guilt **not** using it and going to work right away.  Additionally, the excess debt that the last year or year and half might cause me is also unattractive if I were to *not* use my degree.  My original plan before I started college was to work hard for a degree as a backup plan while pursuing things like music and other endeavors (like every other student probably).  I find that with the pressures of getting internships (which I do have, over a years worth) and making connections, I'm getting channeled more and more into a career right away out of college.

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering in May.  I currently live in Michigan but have been looking to move elsewhere because of the ridiculously bad job outlook here.  I've had a phone interview with a company in California a few weeks ago but they decided to ""hire internally"".  

There is a company about 10 minutes from my apartment that has an internship in web development/software engineering and I easily meet all of the requirements and the work seems genuinely interesting.  I'm confident enough in my resume and interviewing skills that if I get a call, I could get the job.  

This isn't a money issue but a practicality issue for me.  I'm getting to the point where I'm worried that I won't find a ""real"" job soon (I currently work for slightly above minimum wage position with near full-time hours) and that I should just get all of the directly related work experience that I can get (though I do have some from a self-started company, but I don't know how convincing that looks on a resume).  

A big part of the decision for me is the fact that my apartment lease ends in a little less than a month and if I don't find anything in that time, I'll move in with my parents to save money on rent.

If you were in my shoes, would you try for an internship, especially with it being in my neighborhood?  Furthermore, if I could get an internship across the country, should I go for it, even with the hike in moving and living costs?  At least here, I can fall back on moving back in with my parents if things turn really sour but if I moved across the country I'd probably be locked in a lease, somewhat frantic, having lost a lot of money due to moving.

Maybe this sounds like a silly question, but I guess I just don't know how realistic my chances are of getting a job.  I don't want to have taken an internship and then realized that I should have gotten a job offer somewhere had I just stuck it out a little longer.

Thanks!

* research intern at a prominent DC education think tank
* After the internship was hired on a contract basis to help with another project.

So like I said she is looking to get in to international development probably starting out doing project backstopping? Probably with an NGO/USAID contractor type place? 

What do you have reddit? Any leads?

I need some type of software package to recommend to them. They want the ability to schedule appointments, manage their client's and volunteer's information, and map out the quickest routes to take for the volunteers. Basically they want a Google Maps + Database + Customer Relationship Management all wrapped up in an application. Any suggestions?"
cuoux,1,2010-07-28,"I'm stuck with a gym inadequately equipped for squats, deadlifts and power cleans until October... should I follow the weight machine program they gave me or try alternative free weight exercises?",Mordisquitos,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cuoux/im_stuck_with_a_gym_inadequately_equipped_for/,"Long story short, I'm slightly overweight (1.75 m, 85 kg / 5 ft 9 in, 187 pounds) but not too unfit. I'm doing a summer internship in a different city and I joined the gym just below my workplace for convenience. The trainers gave me a pretty vanilla program, mostly consisting of Nautilus-style machines and some cardio to improve my general fitness.

However, that was before I decided to do free weights following the Starting Strength beginners program.

Now I've decided to do free weights, you could say I'm appalled at the weights section: there's no rack (only a Smith machine), no platform, no bumper plates, no standard height plates... and hardly enough floor space to do anything outside of a bench or the Smith machine. There's even a sign saying _""Please do not move the benches""_, so making some room would, in principle, be out of the question.

I'm certainly going to check out other gyms in the area but from what I've seen I very much doubt they'll be any better.

Anyway, it seems like if I don't find a gym with a decent weights section, my options are:

+ Continue the machine program they gave me until the end of September and join a decent gym when I get home. At least I'll lose some weight.

+ Start a weird version of Starting Strength with no proper squat or power clean, and probably no deadlift either. Can I replace these with dumbbell variations? Is _starting_ squats with a Smith Machine worse than doing no squats at all?

Just for the record, buying my own equipment is out of the question for the time being.

Thanks for the attention! If you would like any more details don't hesitate to ask."

I was in a hospital the size of a large ranch style house that specialized in the treatment of the elderly. This struck me as odd as all hospitals seem to specialize in the treatment of old people. The staff consisted of three people, the experienced doctor and his two interns who were both around my age(20). One of the interns was a guy named Eric, a freshman that attends my university whom I met through a mutual friend. 

There was a camera crew documenting their actions as they were doing a special on hospitals with their specific specialization. Eric was obviously putting on a show for the cameras, all smiles, casually joking around with his fellow intern as the head doctor seemed OK with their behavior, not wanting to be made out as the bad guy on camera. I don’t remember ever saying anything while in the hospital except making a comment on how all kids from his area growing up seem to get on TV(what I said made no sense).

Suddenly I ended up in the middle of a street talking to a girl. I can’t recollect who she was or what we were talking about but I was having a conversation with her in front of another ranch style house when two guys strolled up. As they were walking towards us, Jason Segel walked out of the house that we were standing in front of. He was dressed as if he were straight out of his role in Freaks and Geeks with a denim jacket. He just sat down in the grass looking at us with a smile. Eventually the two guys got to me and the girl when one pulled out a gun and shot her. I began to run to the house Jason just exited while he approached the situation I was leaving. Out of the corner of my eye, the gunman shot Jason in the head. 

I ran into the house knowing that I was going to be next. I had to hide so I ran into the basement where there was a room with a closet. I ran into the closet and waited. I was afraid and basically waited for my fate as I heard them enter upstairs. This is where things get even weirder because I realize that I have had dreams like this before and that every time I just wait and hide from whoever it is looking for me until they inevitably find me and I wake up (assuming they kill me). Realizing this, I look around and find a single metal coat hanger on the bar hanging above my head. I grab it, twist the top part of it until the hook breaks off and I straighten it out. The two men are now down in the basement and I ready myself. They enter my room, joking around about the two that they just killed. I use this to my advantage, as they are not mentally prepared to find me. The man who was wielding the gun opens the closet when I jump on him, lunging the straightened coat hanger into his stomach. He drops his gun as his friend just looks at it dumbfounded. I grab the gun and shoot him in the head. I wake up.

I just got into an internship at a small company and they want me to design some Android App UI layouts for them.

I know about [DroidDraw](http://www.droiddraw.org/) but that is not really what I am looking for. I don't think that it has been updated in a long time and is missing many components that I want to use.

I am writing in response on Company Name department Co-op position (Engineering Co-op ####). I believe that I have most requirements necessary for the job opening. I am interested in an engineering position this upcoming fall (after August 21 2010).


I currently am junior at the University of ########### and enrolled as a Mechanical Engineer student. I have completed the basic mechanical engineering classes (statics, dynamics, mechanics of material, science of material, fluids mechanics and thermodynamics). I have also taken three classes of drafting and computer aided design and engineering. Part of my degree has also made me take electrical and manufacturing classes. One of the larger aspects of the University ###########’s curriculum is that students get hands on experience and testing during laboratories. 


On my previews co-op I work with my mentor and CEO (of ###########) to design, develop and manufacture a “Load Limiter”. I have also worked with in a team of students and also work by myself. I am skill in two 3D CAD programs (AutoCAD Inventor and Dassault CATIA). I understand mechanical and electrical diagrams and I am capable of machining and wiring/soldering electrical component. 


I am a self-problem solver. During my free time I has develop my electronics, microcontrollers, and programing skills to develop an all-around engineering knowledge. My computer skills are higher than average and I am capable of picking up a new engineering drafting or 3D modeling software within a couple of days. I am specially skill with CATIA and AutoCAD inventor, but I have previously used Solidworks and Pro/E. 


I have worked both in an office environment and a machine shop environment. I understand all the aspects of designing, developing, manufacturing during my co-op and internships. Working in both the office and in a machine shop has given me better all-around knowledge of what is possible for a machinist to do and what engineer designer can produce. I also have great organizing and efficient work skills. 


I have attached my resume for your assessment. I would appreciate having the chance of talking with you about my chances of getting employed. I thank you for your time and would look forward to and opportunity of talking to you about a internship job this Fall 2010. 


Sincerely,

cvy63,51,2010-07-31,Cannabis: My Anti-Drug,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/cvy63/cannabis_my_antidrug/,"Hear me out! Cannabis is letting me get back to how I was before depression hit. It's stretched my consciousness out of that litte sad box, and it reminded me how good simply being can be.

As a result, I'm getting more work done, and enjoying every second of it. Adderall may satisfy giving you the energy to work, but cannabis gives one the joy to live, and thus to work.

If I'm a lazy pothead, I'm certainly less lazy than I was without pot. I've mopped the floors, vacuumed the stairs, and filled out applications to a slew of jobs and internship programs. My mom says I'm happier and more willing to spend time with the family. I feel like cannabis is being a good friend and taking away all the stress and worry of depression, so that me and my family don't have to deal with it.

Anyway, blah blah blah, cannabis is my anti-drug because it takes away the side-effects of the SSRIs and SNRIs, and picks up the slack where they left off. It does what Abilify is marketed for.

The only (bad) side effects are that I go into a stupor if I smoke too much (so I don't), and I get the munchies. But all in all, that's great as far as antidepressants go. Where's the suicidally? The lowering of the seizure threshold? The aversion to grapefruit? The lowered libido?

Seriously, this is good medicine.  What the hell is wrong with our government?

tl;dr: Cannabis is a good treatment for depression in my experience."
