I will be starting my internship at Google in June.

Google is requiring nothing from me, however, I will have no money until two weeks in when I get my paycheck. 

I am currently working in an unpaid internship elsewhere.

I have made websites in the past, fixed computers, etc.

I am willing to do anything that cant get me arrested or ruin my job chances.

Help me figure this out (I might be able to get away with only saving 2k) 

Edit: My mother is on disability and my father is out of the picture, I have no family I can borrow from, and no previous credit history. Unless you can beat that with a borrowing suggestion, dont suggest borrowing."

(*This might get very long, im writing down whatever comes to my head and have no clue how long it will get.*)

I got a problem and i'm not intirely sure how to adress it. I'm aware that I should see a doctor asap about my mental condition(s) but as of now thats not possible, it will be about another month before I will be able too and I want to see if I can find out whats wrong with me. 
Since 2 months now I suspect myself having fast cycle bi-polar disorder, I show all the symptons and family history with mental issues, my mom been battling with allot depressions when I grew up and my dad not being around. However there are a bunch of other symptoms I cannot make sense of, symptoms that are key to diagnoses of other disorders but not to Bipolar. 


**The reason I was suspecting being bipolar**
I got positive (Manic like) episodes and depression like episodes on a daily basis. They pop up spontainously and seem to cycle day by day. Being depressed I feel emotionless, empty, suicidal and without any self respect or values. When i'm positive I get ideas and thoughts running trough my head, things I have to get out and tell people or explain them about. My sexdrift gets up way high and I even seem to show interest in the most bizzare japanese sex movies and even be bisexual. When i'm drunk during these episodes I get completly bat shit crazy. 



**The reason  I think it might be something else**
These episodes seem to be random and can sometimes just last 2 hours. They can be triggered of and on by negative or positive surroundings and it feels just like something is taking over the way I think. I also can't show any real emotion, I tend to copy my surroundings and when people get sad I get sad. Often when I read a story I have a hard time of having a real opinion about it, its very hard for me to tell if its negative or positive. When i'm around invidivials (friends or strangers). I scan their behaviour attitude or choice of words and try to adjust myself to their likings, if I don't do this I think i'm going to be ignored by them at a later point. In the past I have often lied to people to bring me to a higher status and have people think that i'm ""cool"", or just lied out of nowhere while moments later not understanding why I just lied to this person and regretting it without being able to tell them. I have deliberately used friends in the past over a long time to gain profit out of them on the long run. At that time it was PERFECTLY understandable but when the friendship ended I was shocked and sad about it. Sometimes I even try to manipulate friends into taking a different ground in their ideas or try out something new.  I tend to bond to people to fast and easially. I can be talking normally to a girl and suddently I fall in love with her on spot and admiring here like I really do love her, this happens with girls I just mett or girls I know for a longer while and Fell in love and got back to my senses over and over again. Its also hard for me to really understand people, I know what their moods or feelings mean but I cannot place myself in their shoes that easially.But then at times I pretend I completely understand a person and am suddently able to fit myself in their shoes. Also I have no ""style"" or how you wan't to define this. Whenever I dress up I feel like everybody judges me by my look and clothing choice, when I see somebody with nice clothes I will keep his style in mind and probably try to copy it just to find out that I don't feel any different. I see myself also as pretty social awkward and at times I think in 3 different languages (not sure if writing that even makes sense, but i'm fluent in 3). I'm TERRIBLE afraid of confrontations and what people might think of me. Sometimes i'm afraid to log into my email in the morning because my friend might responded to a mail I send him and diddn't like what I explained/told him. This gets even worse with people I do not know. Once I do the ""thing"" that I was so afraid of I can't understand why I actually was afraid of it. I'm pretty sure that once I hit the submit button on this story that I will have a very hard time comming back and read comments. (dw I will come back). 


I also have a past of crime, crime I shouldn't have comitted and still have a very hard time to stop with. I have almost gotten caught twice and I cant stop even tho I know that its a matter of time that I will get caught with this behaviour. I don't really need to do this but I feel like I need to and its almost a urge. I think of other criminal acts in my head that I have never commited but seem ""cool"". 

This has been my life in the past 10 years and as I aged it got stronger, in the last 3 years it almost got unbearable to the point where I sometimes felt like death would be the only way out, and done some pretty retarded things while being in my manic episodes. I also tried to change my life from going to the gym, reading self help books, getting a job, doing unpaid internships, partying each weekend, gaming each weekend, trying to pick up new girls each day.....(you probably get it) but nothing helps, i tried everything to change my lifestyle with and I remain the same person. 

Often its like im viewing myself in the third person when I do these things, I notice that I do them but have a very hard time to take action. The last 2 years I started to understand when I ""change"" and often im able to stop myself from doing stupid stuff by just supressing my thoughts or pretending nothing is wrong with me.


That's it for now, im happy to answer questions and even happier if people can help me out and perhaps tell me whats wrong with me or explain how there is nothing wrong with me at all. Just for the reference, im a 22 Year old male, going trough a very hard time trying to finish college again for the 4th time since I was 17 (My record has been 5 1/2 months). 


Edit: Mayb something to add. Mostly I feel ""empty"" even when i'm manic. But when I feel depressed I can have moments of happiness or spontainously fall out of my depressed state and flip back in it within a matter of minutes (or so it seems). Also I feel almost ""obsessed"" with having mental health issues, I don't even see it as a bad thing it just feels ""natural"" being me and explains ALLOT and doesn't really concern me. If it wouldn't sound so crazy and farfetched i'd almost say im schizophrenic
TL:DR. I think im going crazy. 


Ps. My country supplies free healthcare but since I just moved back from another country and have yet to register myself as a citizen i'm unable to recieve it. I will be able to recieve healthcare in the next 2-4 weeks so this will be the first thing I will talk to my doctor about from day one. But as of now there is not much I can do"
c0ftf,1,2010-05-05,When 'education' becomes exploitation.,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/c0ftf/when_education_becomes_exploitation/,"Reposted from Digg, but I thought it was a relevant topic. I have to say that I've seen this while working as an intern for some companies. 

At one point I was getting paid $13/hr to do most of the tasks that a web firm had previously taken care of ($90/hr) as well as playing the role of IT consultant/advisor ($120/hr) as well as my own duties, such as managing the computer networks, repairing systems, performing website updates, etc. When, after working their over a year, I asked them for a raise (from $13/hr to $16/hr) they said they couldn't afford it, and I quit. I also happened to know that the actual workers their were making between 80 andd 100K, to give me work to do that they didn't want to do themselves. In otherwords, absolutely useless, for the most part. Incidently, they hired a new intern. Finally, to add insult to injury, when I put in my notice (in a very nice and polite manner) they expected me to hang around indefinitely until they found an intern, initially putting that task on me as well. WTF?

To me, this was absolutely an exploitation of labor, and services. I felt many times like I was absolutely being used, but I also felt like this is what an internship was suppose to be like and didn't think it would be any different anywhere else. I'm glad I was wrong, but I think that if this kind of practice is not stemmed, one day it will be like this everywhere else.

Need ideas/inspiration/thoughts on a logo/branding. Below is a full description of the fund.

==========================================

The Smiley Child Education Fund is aimed at assisting children in developing worlds to achieve a brighter, happier future through education. With compassion, philanthropy and dedication, the founder, Salifu Kamara, has been given the opportunity to receive education at Clark University in Worcester, MA. Originally from Sierra Leone, Mr. Kamara experienced civil war first-hand as a child and lost his family including siblings. In spite of the hardships, death of parent and siblings, Mr. Kamara has remained optimistic, determined, and reverent. The ability to receive an education has brought him much happiness and joy and has restored strong hope to him.

“When I am in class, I can’t help but smile,” Mr. Kamara said, “I want all children to be happy like I am.”

With his bright smile, warm personality, and inspiring story, Mr. Kamara has become a celebrity around the campus. Also, he wants to use his story for good, helping to create a better world for the millions of children living in poverty and lack of formal education in developing countries. 

Mr. Kamara’s vision for the Smiley Child Education Fund is to offer scholarships for children in developing nations to acquire sound education up to post-secondary institutions. Additionally, he would like to create and raise awareness of the struggles that these millions of children face every day such as lack of formal education, lack of portable water, hunger, diseases and exploitation by sex traffickers has led young female potential leaders to become commercial sex bandit. 

The Smiley Child Education Fund (SCEF) hopes to train teachers in these developing countries through volunteering network of professionals on seasonal basis, empowering teachers with professional know-how of passing on the materials to their students in their respective countries.  SCEF will also partners with other NGO’s to supply educational material to tutors including materials for  students use. There will also be a forum to engage international students in internship opportunities among the targeted countries. Another concern for SCEF is in the area of computer education which entails basic use of computers, internet and e-mail. Creation of Pen Pal type of communication program between students and the international community will be another goal of Smiley Child Education Fund. 

Mr. Kamara strongly believes that creating a connective world is an integral part to achieve high yield of development, growth and a peaceful environment while the voiceless will easily be heard.

I've been in quite the bad mood today. I'm graduating from college in a few weeks and I thought I had my whole job situation locked up. Turns out I was wrong. It's a little long winded, but let me tell you all about it...


Three weeks ago I went to New York to interview with my old summer job. I worked at this place as an intern and I loved it. My boss loved having me there too. On numerous occasions he came up to me saying ""Haha! KJEveryday! You should work here after you graduate!"" He said this mumltiple times, commenting on how much good work I've done, but I politely laughed it off - trying to act a bit coy since I had no fucking idea what I wanted to do with my life at the time. Anyway, back to three weeks ago. I get a call from them saying they want to talk to me about a position full time. That they have ""great ideas"" for a position that may fit my qualifications. So they pay for a train ticket for me to come up and ""interview"" with them in NYC. 

At the ""interview"" my boss gives me a hug and tells me about the position. He sprinkles in a few ""Son, your one of the best young people I've met in a long time. I think you'll do great here."" It sounds great. They ask me how much I want. I say 65k (The job is project manager and it would involve a lot of traveling so I thought this would be a good point to start off negotiating). He says ""Okay. that's in out ballpark."" We talk vacation, office culture, sick days, everything. Sounds great. The HR person comes over, the same person who ran my internship program, we talk about the same stuff, the three of us. They ask me on the spot if I like it, I say ""I have other offers, but I definitely feel like this is one of my, if not ""the"", top choices at the moment. I make it pretty clear without showing all of my cards. They make it clear they are giving me an offer verbally. They say the written one will come by Thursday or Friday (it's a Tuesday). I go home beaming. I got myself a job, once that email comes I think, I'll accept it since I really enjoy the place.


I wait until Thursday. Nothing.


Friday. Nothing.


Monday. Nothing.


Tuesday comes and I get an email that the HR person wants to schedule a call with me. Sweet, we can negotiate salary I think. I give her my availability (which is very flexible since I'm a student with just a few classes). She says she'll call me in 2 days. She doesn't. She reschedules. She reschedules again. And again. Fast forward today, 6 reschedules later, I finally talk to her on the phone. the wait has been EXCRUCIATING. During this time I'm having finals, doing my senior thesis, plannings my moving situation. Having the job is the only thing that's keeping me sane. When we begin talking she says the following:

Does anyone have any advice?

**EDIT 2**: For everyone saying I should look other places: I've interviewed in other places before this. I've been in the whole ""OCR"" (On-Campus Recruiting) mode for the past 6 months.

So, how much is it really necessary to disclose? They want the NDA signed and sent back today, which doesn't really give me much time. I figure the more I discuss the better, but it's difficult because the idea I have is still somewhat fluid."

If you're looking to be in Evanston for the summer, check out MOSAIC Co-op. Our subletting chairperson wants us to post the following semi-generic description:

Spend the summer with a vibrant, diverse, friendly, welcoming and cooperative community of 13 Northwestern students and young professionals! In the past we have had interns from many different countries (Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Greece, China, and the Czech Republic) as well as many local students from Northwestern University and young professionals from Chicago and the nearby suburbs.

Great location: just half a block from the El, two blocks from the Northwestern campus, and a ten minute walk from the Metra rail (to get downtown in about 25 minutes).

We are looking to sublet several rooms between July 1st and mid September, with both singles and doubles available.

Rent ranges from $600 - 740 per month (depending on the room size). You also have the option to participate in our very affordable meal plan, which includes delicious home cooked dinners and a full stock of common food.

&lt;/generic description&gt;

Seriously the food is tasty. All community dinners are vegetarian with a vegan option, but the co-op doesn't care if you keep your own meat in the house and you can cook it all you want. There are rad dance parties during the school year (I really don't know how much of this there will be in the summer, but if there is, it's awesome). You'll meet fun people with interesting things to talk about. You could have delicious dinner cooked for you four nights a week, or cook for other people four nights a week.

If you're going to be at Northwestern for the summer, the price really is incredible for how close to campus you get. It takes no more than five minutes

For certain rooms, the rent may be negotiable. If you're in the area now you should pm me and set up a time to check out the house and eat dinner.

Please pm me with your contact information and the dates that you are interested in living with us.

Check out the co-op's website at http://www.mosaiccoop.org/

If you take my room (or any room), I will buy you beers. I'll be around during the summer, whether I'm living there or not. We can drink beers and talk about reddit. If you help me save me money I will buy a reddit shirt and maybe throw in some orangered soap.

Okay, so I had a phone interview this past Wednesday morning at 8:30 AM for a position at a company for an undergraduate internship over the summer. I suppose I'm nervous as per whether or not I'll advance to the next round of interviews as although the interviewer said I had good answers, I was nervous over the phone and get the feeling I could have done better. I hope he expected the people he was interviewing to be nervous (after all, the position is only open to undergrads), as otherwise, I don't suppose I have a chance to get the position...

Anyway, it's been 3 days (not counting the weekend, since it's not a work day). How long should I keep waiting before I abandon hope/send an email/kick myself for flubbing up?

EDIT: I sent a thank you note the evening of the interview. I'm just worried that my qualifications will be ignored because I was nervous over the phone. :("

This semester has been a nightmare for me. I'll admit that I did way too much partying and not much of attending class. I have always been somewhat of an intelligent guy, never needing to listen in class and still able to easily obtain a 3.5 GPA. I never expected myself to be in this situation, ever. I just hit a road block this year, without even realizing, I was no longer able to score high on Exams. Well, now after this semester, I know that I have to attend classes now, and actively listen.

I earned under a 1.5 semester GPA this semester, it was my second semester of my Junior year, and my parents have cut me off. I'm not sure as to what actions to take. I want to continue school and retake my classes, but being cut off doesn't quite help the cause.

Oh yeah, I did have a few internship interviews that will give back to me within a week. Hopefully I get one, as that would help my financial situation.

What should I do? Any advice?

I was fortunate (lucky) enough to land a 16/mo internship at IBM doing software development. First, let me say... I'm a finance major, who has taken some CS classes and had some IT jobs in the past.

In terms of the actual job, it's mostly php and databases, which I am familiar with.. but once again, on a small scale. During the first few days I pretty much did a lot of nodding and didn't really understand anything that was going on. When I used php before it was mostly for adding OO functionality to the sites I worked on to reduce redudundant coding... my IBM projects are much more complicated.


I'm kind of scared because I really want to do well and learn a lot but I feel that I won't be able to get up to speed with all the technology and start contributing for a LOOONG time. I guess the ONE good thing I can say is pretty much everyone I've talked to feels overwhelmed.

The story, summarized, is that I'm a journalism major graduating next week from Rutgers, and for the past year I've been seeking an internship as my professors have really pounded into my head that I was going to need one. In January, I got a lead so promising that I ended up putting all of my eggs in one basket. In the end, after months of correspondence and them all but guaranteeing that I would have it (it was a PR firm working with Novartis oncology), they sent me a one line email telling me that I was not what they were looking for after all.
 

And it got me thinking. What future is there in journalism? I'll level with you- I have let myself be inspired by the Murrows, Woodwards and Bernsteins of this once noble profession. I believe in the tenets of objectivity and freedom of speech. But 99% of journalism isn't like that. If you want to go anywhere in this field, you're going to sell responsibility eventually. 

According to who I've talked to, the starting salary for a journalist is as low as the upper twenties and few make it to six figures before they're done with their career. Money isn't everything to me, but I hate to know where my limits are... and that I could easily surpass that in a much less stressful profession. And right now, journalism is changing rapidly and painfully due to reasons you're all aware of. As one person replied, a journalism degree isn't really worth anything anymore.


I'm not entirely pessimistic about my future, but I am scared. And I'm fed up with the way American journalism has become so symbiotic with entertainment. Christ, if I had the ability to, I'd just leave New Jersey and try to see the world, but I don't have that option right now. So here I am, graduating in a week from tomorrow, and I have no prospects. None. And I worked very in college, too hard to start selling life insurance. 


Sorry to ramble... There's a lot of frustration within me, and no one wants to listen to me seriously. To return to my question, what are some lucrative paths I can take with a degree in journalism? I know that PR is one option, though it's certainly not my first choice. But what about publishing, or something? I'm not married and willing to travel and move just about anywhere that speaks English. 


And I'm not saying that I've abandoned all hope of being a journalist. I just want to know that I DO have some options. Right now I feel trapped.

Thanks, Reddit.

About 2 years ago, I made up my mind and just started doing it. I am now about 9 months into my first real development job. 

I've worked hard to get here, I moved my family a thousand miles to take an internship for very little money, and it has seemed to pay off so far.

The thing is, now I am worried I cannot go back to what i was doing before, I simply can't. I love this far too much. The problem however, is that the company I've been working with is a small startup. 

We use python/django/twisted/MySql. I've learned a lot, and have some very sharp developers showing me the ways. These guys are obsessive about maintainability, code reviews, and general cleanliness.

I'd like to think that I am now *in* but even though the talent is top notch (as far as I can tell) The survival of my company is not guaranteed. 

Lets assume for arguments sake that I know django inside and out, python pretty well, and i feel like i can do  pretty much do anything in javascript.. If my company shuts the doors tomorrow...am I screwed?

Will i be ok on these not so popular technologies? I will do whatever it takes, code is code. I will learn php if i have to (not my first choice)
I will never be satisfied with what I know, but do you think I am employable? If not...then what should i go after? ASP? .NET? C#? PHP?

I have been working with C, C++ in my spare time, but I don't think that that is any good to an employer (Sure you can hack on our low level code! If you can do project euler you can do anything!)

I don't think i could search all over the country and be willing to move anywhere again. The only reason i am where i am is because i was so hungry and was willing to do anything. 

I appreciate any input you guys have. If you read this far, then thank you for your time.

c1ncx,1,2010-05-08,Reddit: have any ideas on how to teach East African's to use ultra cheap laptops?,oivaizmir,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c1ncx/reddit_have_any_ideas_on_how_to_teach_east/,"Reddit, I need your creativity,

I've gotten an internship in East Africa starting in August with the NGO One Laptop Per Child (www.laptop.org). My job will be teaching children, aged 6-12, how to use the ultra-cheap XO laptop.

While OLPC is giving me tons of training, I think it would be a mistake to not make use of that constant ingenuity and inventiveness that pervades Reddit. I feel like it would be hard to find a community that has benefited from the internet revolution more than Redditor's, and that it would be a worthwhile task to actually see what sort of ideas we can come up with.

I'm really looking for any ideas that will work to educate these kids on how to use these computers, and to stimulate their curiosity. My ambition is to give these kids every tool I can think of to develop their intellectual curiosity. 

So far, my lesson plans consist of things like scavenger hunts across the internet. I'm sure the Reddit community can do a lot better than that. I am bringing things like a projector, movie camera, movies, etc, to let the kids in on a window of what else there is in the world. If you can think of any novel ways to use things like this, or other things I should bring, I'm all ears.

Any ideas would be more then appreciated; if I make use of anyone's idea I'll definitely give a full report back on how it went. I feel like there is no greater learning tool then the internet, and sincerely believe that it could work to liberate these children from the physical and educational poverty that they are immersed in. To do this, I don't want these kids to be limited by my sub-par teaching skills, or inadequate instruments, but rather only their own curiosity and creativity.

I'm hoping for some clarity on an odd situation, and I'm thinking that posting here is probably better than moping around the house all day trying not to cry. So here's my story.

I am a 24 year old female unhappily married to a 27 year old, we've been together for 7+ years. We separated last year, but have been muddling along ever since trying to make it work, and basically a divorce is on the way. I'm hesitant to file the papers for a variety of reasons, but I don't think the details on this are terribly relevant because the trouble arises from another guy.

I met this guy in Fall of 2008 when I was observing his class (he's a high school teacher), we had a good time, but since I was in a relationship it never went anywhere and we didn't really keep in touch. Then, as luck would have it, when I was assigned to my year-long internship for my master's program last fall, I was assigned to the same school teaching in the same magnet program as he does. We've hung out throughout the year and grown a little closer. We share a lot of things with each other, hang out during planning periods, flirt a little, etc. Definitely some strong chemistry and attraction there. I had no trouble openly telling him that I really like him.

A few weeks ago he asked me if I wanted to stick around after school to see our kids in a play that night, and we agreed to grab a bite to eat across the street beforehand. We had a nice dinner, during which I explained my entire relationship situation to him, he shared some of his stories, and we chatted a little about what we're looking for. Then, earlier this week I asked him if he was going to another play that our kids are in, this one down in the city instead of at our school. He said he wasn't sure, asked if I wanted to go, I said yeah, so we agreed to meet for dinner and go to the play, which was last night. I know this sounds bad, could be construed as cheating, but please keep in mind that my marriage is on the outs and that we were going out as colleagues and not on a date. I know it's wrong, but I'm lonely.

Again it was a good time, but he made a little stinging joke before the play that I was having a hard time landing him because the girls he usually dates are mixed race/exotic looking. A joke, but ouch. After the show he walked me to my car and I needed him to get it out of a tight space for me. I asked him if he really hasn't asked me out yet because I'm a plain white girl, commencing a ~20m conversation about whether or not we should date when I'm finally divorced.

This is where the possible rejection arises... I completely understand all of his concerns, but still it hurts and I would still like to go out with him when I'm single. Basically, at the core of things is a huge age gap. He's almost 43, wedging 19 years between us. He knows I was previously involved with a man 16 years my senior (don't ask), and he's dated women in their twenties before. However, he basically kept saying that he wants to, but isn't sure if we should, citing the following things:

* If we do go out, and after a few times wind up in bed together, etc, and then it doesn't work out, it would be hurtful to me for my first pursuit after the divorce
* He's never been married or even lived with someone, basically not gifted at long-term relationships... and given the age gap, my divorce, etc, it seems like it might be doomed
* We share an office (I pointed out that this is only the case for a few more weeks)
* We know each other well, it would be different than if we were just strangers going out

That's all I can remember right now, I'm sure there's more to it. But basically, he concluded that he figures we could go out, who knows what the future holds. Throughout the conversation I said a few times that if the answer is no, it's fine, just say no. He always responded by saying, ""it's not no."" Essentially I feel as though maybe he's not interested in me after all, and just doesn't want to outright reject and hurt me. But on the other hand, he's open to the idea of us going out on a date when I'm available, he just has all these thoughts, which I completely understand. 

I really, really like him and think it could go somewhere, but I realize that it may not and that's fine. I just think it's worth a shot and there's no harm in going out a few times to see. But I also feel as though if he were really into me, he wouldn't be so hesitant. Should I treat this like a light rejection and stop hanging around him at work? Or is it worth my time and energy and possible future rejection to nudge him into it?

**TL;DR**: Older man I temporarily work with may, or may not, be interested in dating me once my divorce is final. Should I take hesitance and concern over age/etc as a rejection and move on, or just snag a date and see what happens?"

It's similar to working at an accounting or law firm minus the defined career path, network and vacation time. I also took a big pay cut (~25%) to get this job and I pay for my own health insurance (I was one of those people who got their Anthem Blue Cross Insurance raised ***over 39%*** last February)

I've been with the company for 7 months. In that time I've exceeded expectations at both clients and I just had my contract renewed with my current client for the second time (supposed to end in March). Problem is, I have no real sense of job security at the firm. They seem to be very concerned about shareholders and not so much about the people earning the profits (high turnover rate). 

For my own career's sake I need to position myself so that I don't get left behind. There is a wage freeze and at some point I need to start making the money that someone in my level of responsibility makes or I'm going to be perceived as damaged goods in the job market (most people make 30% more than I do in the same position nationally, adjusting for the regions cost of living, it's a little higher than that, source: firm's 2010 salary guide). I don't make the rules, but most employers seem to make snap judgments about a person's abilities and skills based on their pay. I made more money as an Auditor Intern in college than I do nearly 4 years out of school as a Senior Accountant. When I asked about a raise my boss mentioned that there is an indefinite wage freeze going on for the *salaried temp staff* because of the economy.

I got a phone call on Friday from my boss mentioning that my contract with the client was extended again. She also mentioned that we need to *""talk about where I see myself in the company""* and I would be meeting with the branch manager this afternoon. So I arrive at the branch after lunch and I spend 4 hours waiting for the manager to come. I asked her coworkers where she was and everyone else in the office. Apparently she was out of the office at a client. I'm only obligated (paid) to put in my 8 hours, so I left at 4:30pm.

I'm pretty sure they found my resume out there during the time I've been applying for jobs (past month or so). I'm wondering what I should do. When I do meet with the manager I plan on playing up the angle that: ""I am concern about my job security and I'm doing what I need to do to protect myself in case I do lose this job, since I'm not sure that I'd be employed after this current contract is up (was just extended recently, was going to expire at the end of May)"".

**Edit 1:** My question is, what should I do when I am confronted by the manager? What are the odds that they are going to outright try and fire me?

**Edit 2:** I just got a call from one of the places I applied to over the past month (well known company in town). They want me to come in for an interview on Thursday of this week. I feel a little better knowing that I have two potential places of employment if the staffing agency situation deteriorates (the second being the current client which is still looking for a senior accountant. The staffing agency loses out on their $20,000 referral fee if they fire me and I end up getting hired by their client). 

***Summary:***  I'm a salaried temp worker at a staffing firm with little job security and the lowest pay I've had in my professional career, with the most responsibility I've ever had. I suspect my boss found out I've been searching for jobs and wants me to meet with the branch manager to discuss my future with the firm. What should I say to the manager when she confronts me?"

Any suggestions on how to make it up?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c1w9n/i_screwed_up_on_mothers_day_any_suggestions_on/,"My mother works hard taking care of my family and me.  While she does have an annoying flair for the dramatics, I admit that I screwed up today and I don't know how to fix it.

I'm a college student who's back for the summer.  My oldest sister is abroad working, and she sent flowers and chocolates yesterday.  My middle sister is at her boyfriend's place and has been all week, which has upset my mom because my sister will leave to visit the bf for long periods of time without saying when she'll be back.  That, coupled with the fact that she missed Mother's Day and didn't send a card/present makes me feel like I needed to make up for her.

I woke up early this morning and had to have my mother drive me to work, and I only wished her a happy Mother's Day as an afterthought during the car ride.  I got back from my second day of work at a new job around 1pm today, watched TV/browsed the Internet for a bit, and fell asleep for a couple hours.

Woke up at 6pmish, tried to read Reddit to wake myself up a little, around 6:30 I message my dad downstairs to go figure out what restaurant we're taking my mom to.  I suggested Outback Steakhouse because we went there before.  No response for about an hour.

At around 8pm, I asked my mom what was up for dinner and if she had chosen somewhere she'd like to go.  Fuming, she said how my dad had said ""no"" to taking her out -- upon pressing her for details, she said she wanted Olive Garden, which is usually one of my favorites, and he responded by suggesting several different places instead.  She interpreted this as him rejecting her.  I asked if she still wanted to go, and she theatrically (though justifiably) pointed out it was 8pm and it was too late.  Neither my dad nor I can cook anything more than a TV dinner, so we can't make anything for her.

I forgot to get her a card; usually I do that with my middle sister, but since she hasn't been around I forgot.  I never know what to get her for a present, so I end up never getting around to that.  A bad habit, I know.

Tomorrow, I work until 1pm again and go out again for an internship at around 3:30pm, while my mom has to go driving a few hours to go pick up my sister from the bf's place.  So, we can't do a makeup dinner tomorrow night.

What do you suggest?  Should I try something Tuesday night?  If so, what?  She's the type who would refuse doing a make-up dinner outing, as she's strict on keeping things on holidays for their significance.  (I so very much hate Hallmark holidays.)

21/M USA
BA in International Relations (Poly Sci/Econ/History/Language) from a top 15 University.

So I had been working at a test prep company that gave me an opportunity to work with living expenses paid, reasonable hours, and a very attractive wage after graduation. My plan was to do that for a year or two before I go off to graduate school. About a month ago I got fired out of the blue, leaving me a bit late in the game for entry-level jobs starting after graduation, and absolutely no good leads.

After a few days trying to figure out what to do next, I actually became a bit excited by the prospect of finding a new job. The way I look at it, I'm not terribly picky on what I'm looking for, and this is a benefit. I would just as happily take a paralegal job as I would a English teaching job in a foreign country. Really anything that would allow me to live sustainably and be of even remote interest. I figure if I don't find something that I can sink my teeth into, not a problem, I'll just put my time in for a year and then head off to graduate school.

My results have been minimal, but this is no surprise given the economy. However I'm starting to think that I'm wasting a lot of time just applying to everything. What industries are hiring right now? Especially those that can take people without direct experience. As of right now my work experience is basically limited to teaching, an internship doing SEO stuff, and tour guiding.

Where should I be looking? Should I be focusing on any particular regions or fields of study? 

Thanks in advance.

tl;dr About to graduate from college, just having to start the job search. If I'm not looking for anything too specific, what regions or industries should I look to maximize my possibilities."
c1ybi,9,2010-05-10,Should I walk away from a relationship with my parents?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c1ybi/should_i_walk_away_from_a_relationship_with_my/,"23 yr old female, thanks in advance for any insight or advice

My father is depressed, on medication and refuses to get counseling. His issues relate to relationship problems with his late parents, his siblings, and feeling under-appreciated in his career. He treats my mother poorly by talking down to her, complaining about her lifestyle to me and my siblings, and not believing her fibromyalgia symptoms (ie. she's often tired and/or in pain, where he says she's lazy or over-exaggerating). Despite this my mom stands by my father in everything he says and does, whether or not she agrees with him (in my opinion). She either is oblivious to his poor treatment of her, or is very, very good at ignoring it and chalking it up to his depression.

My relationship with my father has been tense for a few years now, after I spent time traveling with my boyfriend (we were both in our early 20s at the time). In my father's 1950's upbringing, a ""good girl"" wouldn't spend time alone in the company of a boy - it gives the wrong impression. I knew this was his opinion before I took my trip, however it was my hard-earned money, my vacation time, and I was no longer living with my parents so it was my decision to make. My dad didn't talk to me for 6 months following my trip.

In the 2 years since, our conversation have been superficial and both of us try to avoid any controversial topics. As such, my dad basically ignores that I am in a relationship. I have never heard him say the name of my boyfriend. If I bring my boyfriend up, my dad will remain quiet until the topic has passed. My mother tells me that I'm not to discuss this problem directly because it will ""upset my father"", and that I brought this situation on myself. I thought the relationship between my father and boyfriend would take some time to grow when my father realized how well my boyfriend treats me, and what a good person he is. This has not been the case, and it's not for lack of trying on the part of my boyfriend. This being said, my mom and siblings love my boyfriend. He's been really amazing to me, sticking by me through some pretty rough times, as well as spending time with my family in which my father basically ignores him.

I'm at the point in my life where I'm finally financially independent from my parents, I have a career on the horizon, and I'm ready to start ""real life"". My boyfriend and I are talking about our future together, but I can't see it involving a family who does not have unconditional love and support for my life choices. It's especially hurtful to me because I have been extremely successful in all other areas of my life (securing a competitive internship, getting accepted to one of the top grad schools in the country, and a prestigious fellowship). I feel that traveling with my boyfriend is such a minute ""discretion"" that it should be far outweighed by all of my other accomplishments.

My dad won't talk to me about these issues, and my mom constantly throws her support to my father even when I approach her alone for advice. I don't see things getting any better. I have the overwhelming urge to cut off ties with my parents and never go back home.

**Edit** Thanks for all of your comments. I was pretty bummed out last night after our Mother's Day get together with my parents. It was nice to wake up to some support and suggestions on how to proceed. Thank you!"

c2csf,0,2010-05-10,"Help me Reddit, your my only hope! I'm a 'smoker' and recent college graduate. See where this is going yet?",LostPSUEngr,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c2csf/help_me_reddit_your_my_only_hope_im_a_smoker_and/,"This is a throw away account.

I recently graduated from Penn State with a mechanical engineering degree. I have completed five summers of an internship at a manufacturing facility during my college career. 
I didn't pull in the highest grades however, my GPA is about a 2.8, so grad school isn't much of an option. My GPA would likely be a lot higher, but I spent the last 2 years of college making up for a 'crisis of faith' I had about finishing school, which resulted in one VERY bad semester grade report.

I also enjoy smoking marijuana. 

Now it seems that I'm doomed to never be able to smoke the stuff again if I want to practice as an engineer. The good thing is that I am used to eschewing marijuana for five months out of the year already. I needed to do that as a requirement of my internship. So I know I CAN quit if I decide to. 

However the prospect of never being able to smoke weed again is too much for me. Finding an engineering job that doesn't require drug testing is like finding a needle in a hay stack, or maybe like finding something that just doesn't exist at all.


I want to know if anyone else has experienced this before, and how they dealt with it. Is there an engineering job somewhere out there for me? Is there some peace of advice that could actually make me feel good about quitting weed all together without feeling like I'm selling out on what I believe in?

Please give me some advice Reddit, this has been eating at me for months now.

For example:

-The Strand is supposed to be nearly slave labor

-Starbucks is supposed to be great except for the difficulty getting a job

-Any of the jobs working for greenpeace or standing out on the street are pretty much scams. You get paid based on how many names you get, but even the best signer-upper doesn't get paid that great

Anyway, I feel terrible about having to find a low paying shit job, but I'm in a really abusive work environment at the moment and just need something to pay the bills while I find something worthwhile. 

EDIT: just spoke to another friend. he recommended looking into bar backing, which i have some experience at, but whenever i try to get a foot in a door at bars here, i get completely ignored. any tips on that would help too. 

EDIT 2: a little more info- i have an an awesome internship starting in less than a week which will require tuesdays and wednesdays, that's why i am looking for something low end, they tend to be pretty flexible. thanks again for the ideas, it's taking my mind in several directions i hadn't thought of.

TL;DR version at the bottom.

So I'm about to finish my third year as a computer science student at a tier 2 UC. I interviewed at this company that does user verification(stuff to battle against fraud and such). I had an interview with the head of operations(a CS guy also but does more management stuff now) and he seemed to like me. After I talked to him, he brought in two of the programmers who asked me questions I had answers to. I was quite charming with the interviews as I usually am, getting chuckles out of them every now and then. They left the room and the head of operations came in saying that they really liked me and he was going to give me a little assignment to make sure I knew my stuff. He gave it to me on monday night and said to have it to him by thursday. I finished it on wednesday telling him that I really enjoyed the assignment because I got to learn(mentioning that it was the first time I had to run an apache server and code in a J2EE environment).

he said he would get back to me in a couple of days so I followed up the next monday asking if they had filled the position or not and that I was still interested.
His response to my follow up was that they haven't decided yet and are having a directors meeting the next day so they should have an answer soon.

It has been 6 days since that response and I haven't heard anything back. I'm beginning to worry that they are passing over me which would be normal except that I interviewed at a bunch(about 4-5) of internships over the year and this one felt really good(even offered them my full time over summer and part time over the year).

so my question is, should I re-follow up with them or just wait; if I re-follow up, what should I say?

TL;DR version: I followed up with a computer science internship I was very confident on about a week ago, they said they were going to have a directors meeting the next day and would have an answer soon. It's been about a week and haven't heard, should I re-follow up?"

c4w6u,1,2010-05-16,Can a NY or Chicago redditor help me out this summer?,summerplans,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c4w6u/can_a_ny_or_chicago_redditor_help_me_out_this/,"Hi reddit. This isn't like any of the sob stories that usually seem to get posted here. It isn't even a real sob story and I wouldn't be surprised if people get annoyed at this post. I'm just asking if there's anyone here in the position to do me a huge favor.

Here's the deal. I'm a first-year (freshman) student at the University of Chicago who lives in New Jersey. Up until now, I was planning to do a 9-week immersion program at Middlebury college for the summer. Everything was fine: I'd sent in my application and was just waiting to hear back to see if I'd been accepted. One day I decided to check the app's online status. Everything seems to be in ord--wait. The box saying that the college had received my high school french teacher's rec letter was blank. I contacted Middlebury, and they told me that applications were no longer being accepted. FFFFFUUUUUU. Those were the only plans I had made, since I was sure I was going to go through with it. Shortsighted, I know. I understand that now.

I know how thoughtful redditors can be to those of us in need, and I wanted to ask if there are any New York City or Chicago redditors who would be willing to have me as an intern, paid or unpaid. If you aren't in the position to make this decision, do you work for someone who would welcome an intern? There are really no restrictions on this. I'm an Economics major with no particular specialization as of yet; I'd be interested in an internship with even a vague relation to business, but really, I'm just looking for anything.

You've heard it all before, but I will work hard and listen to what you tell me. Any responses to this at all are appreciated. If you don't say anything now, at least make sure to say hi when I'm bagging your groceries for you at the supermarket.

I meet a girl.  She has a boyfriend, but I only want to be her friend anyway.  We hang out a lot, sometimes just the two of us, but often I’m a third wheel.  I’m fine with it.  She’s a fun girl.

**½ year ago:**

I’ve developed a strong crush on her, while at the same time we’ve become very close friends.  My feelings have become so overwhelming and obvious it’s comparable to an elephant sitting in the room between us.  We end up talking about it.  I never encouraged her to break up with him, or gave any opinion in regard to her current relationship.  I simply told her my feelings.  Here’s what I learned.  Their relationship isn’t that serious.  They’re not right for each other.   She doesn’t think I’m right either, though she does have some feelings for me.  She plans on staying with him until they either get in a big fight (happens a lot) or he goes far away for an internship.  She was quite firm about the latter, though she reminded me it didn’t mean she would go out with me.  She also knows quite well that I’ve never been in a relationship and never been kissed.  She said I can kiss her if I hadn’t gotten one by my birthday, which is this summer.  I don’t think she is trying to lead me on; she probably just feels sorry for how pathetic I am.  She immediately felt guilty for saying all this to me behind her boyfriend’s back, and I feel like a jerk for bringing it all up.  In the end she thought about it for a few days and fully rejected me, trying to give me some closure.  Sadly the closure didn’t work since my stupid brain is in denial of a sort.

**Now:**

After some heart pain and depression I’ve bounced back.  My friendship with her never stopped and is in fact better than it’s ever been.  My feelings for her have remained the same, while my ability to deal with it has gotten much stronger.  I’ve stayed friends with her because she’s fun to be around and is a good friend in return.  If I only wanted to date her I would have ended the friendship a while ago.  
Turns out her boyfriend is in fact going far away in a month, though I’m unsure whether she still plans on ending it.  She may want to stay with him for all I know.  She doesn’t have any other close friends than me at college so I know I’ll be seeing her a lot.  She’ll be spending more time alone and will likely start clinging to me.  I don’t expect her to have changed her mind about me though.  There is a chance, but she already rejected me before.  

**Questions:**

With things changing like this, she and I will end up talking about this stuff again.  If I ask her whether she plans on staying with him and she doesn’t, is it wrong that we’re discussing this behind his back?  …that I know they’ll break up before he does?  Should I wait until she brings it up?  Should I suggest she stop leading him on and end it if it’s not going anywhere between them, or is that my own bias talking?

Also if anyone can tell me whether I’ve done the right thing in all of this, or if I’ve just been an asshole; and whether my interpretations and guesswork seem accurate; it would be much appreciated.  I have no firsthand experience with relationships so I don’t trust my own judgment here.  I’ll take any advice.

And of course I’d like to know whether I still have a chance with her."
c5q1m,11,2010-05-18,I'm applying for a new job.  What do I put as a reason for leaving my last job?,no_more,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c5q1m/im_applying_for_a_new_job_what_do_i_put_as_a/,"About 5 months ago I quit my job as a Junior Graphic Designer in a small print shop.  I worked at this company for about 8 months of which the first three I was an intern.  I hated that place so much, but stayed there because I was unable to find a replacement job and didn't want to be unemployed.    

The first reason for quitting was that I wasn't doing what I signer up for.  When the manager hired me when my internship was over he told me he would hire me to do 40% graphic design work and the rest would be bindery.  In reality it turned out to be 90% stuffing envelopes for mailings, 5% bindery work, and the other 5% consisted of designing very basic items for print and printing envelopes for bulk mailings.  For a while I didn't mind getting paid $14/hr to stuff envelopes, but it got old really fast.    

The second reason for quitting was that the manager was a jerk.  He would always talk down to me and never had any trust in me.  The other graphic designer told me that's how she was treated until the senior designer quit and she got a promotion.  The manager would always harass me and talk behind my back.  He basically treated me like I was a stupid and I felt like I couldn't do anything right.  It got to the point where I was second-guessing my career choice.  The other employees assured me that he was a jerk and I was was an awesome employee, but I couldn't take it anymore.  Apparently that's how he treated the last two people that used to work there.    

The third reason for quitting was that the bookkeeper was an idiot.  She couldn't do anything right.  My paychecks often had the wrong amount on them, they would bounce, and I had to file an extension on my taxes this year because all of the amounts were wrong and my W2 was a mess.    

Finally, the fourth reasoner quitting was that I couldn't tolerate one of the other employees.  She, like the manager would talk behind everyone's backs and was a brown noser.  If she messed up printing, she would hide the evidence costing the company hundreds of dollars.  She also wouldn't shut-up about her personal life and always blasted her crappy music.    

So, what do I put under ""reason for leaving"" on the job applications I am filling out?     

    
**TL:DR**    
I quit my job because I was unhappy.  I don't know what I should write on job application for ""reason for leaving"" my last job.  
* Poor management      
* Harassment    
* Not doing the job I was hired for     
* Not being compensated for work done     
* All of the above?        

Also, if I get asked to elaborate this in an interview, what do I say without looking like a whiny complainer?

**EDIT:**    
Should I check ""no"" under *""Is it alright to contact this employer?""*  I just know he'd give me a bad review.     

**Thanks everyone for your input.  I obviously know not to put/say anything negative about my former job to a prospective employer.  I was just looking for some ideas.  Thanks again for all of your help!**"

All I read on Reddit is how people are constantly busy at work or have a 'set' amount of work to do before they can leave, so I'm curious what you're all doing that keeps you so busy.

I knew there was a drug test, however I didn't know that they were going to hair test me. I don't usually smoke, but this Spring break (March 19 - March 27) I went hard on the verde with my friends. And I did a little bit of research on my own and found that hair tests can accurately see what drugs you have been taking in the past 90 days. Therefore, I have only been free 53 days including today. I cut my hair 8 days after March 27th.

I have just cut my hair to 3/8ths of an inch on top and 1/4ths of an inch on both sides today. I'm now considering getting some nair and applying it all over my body to remove all my other body hair. I was just wondering what reddit thought about this? Or if Reddit had any suggestions. Do you guys think my new hair cut has removed all the ""dirty"" hair? Keep in mind I got a haircut 8 days after March 27th, so most of the ""dirty"" hair should be on the outer portion of my head. Are there any unforeseen consequences of my actions if I decide to nair my entire body? Anyone have any experience with this?

I really need this internship and any advice and suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much in advance!"

Stuck in a shitty apartment that is not what we expected and not sure what to do.,nastyapartment,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c6dbe/need_help_stuck_in_a_shitty_apartment_that_is_not/,"My girlfriend and I have recently moved to the east coast for the summer (we have an internship) and found what seemed like a decent apartment online.  We rented 2 rooms with another person who is an intern with the same company we are, but when we arrived things were not as we expected.  

We thought that just a quick cleanup would suffice to make the place livable, but frankly its looking like this place hasn't been cared for in some time.  The bathrooms are pretty gross, the kitchen is filled with old stuff from previous tenants and the other two tenants (one of whom is moving out soon thankfully) are secretive and don't even seem to really live here.  We've also noticed that we can hear the electricity going through the wall in our room... and it's really freaking scary.  The room we got looked nice at first, but now that we've seen it in good light, it's actually really dusty in the corners and generally looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. 

What we're wondering is what rights we have to end the lease (if it comes to that) and move, and what we can do to try to get out of this mess before this house kills us somehow.  We signed the lease to move in when we arrived a few days ago.

We live in Maryland, but I don't want to say more in case this is found.

Edit: I'm not crazy... when I say 'hear electricity' I mean that when things are turned on and running, there is a buzzing sound in the wall that occasionally crackles.  The lights in the house flicker at the same time the sound in the wall changes.  We're pretty sure it has *something* to do with the electricity..."

I wonder what /r/sex thinks, and I need advice on how to start a relationship.

25yo straight heterosexual male here. I am into something absolutely incredible. A few years ago I wouldn't have even believed the stuff possible that I now feel on semi-regular basis. (I'm talking several hours of full body orgasms) I am really strongly heterosexual. I don't have anything against homosexuals. I'm just not into it personally.

Anyway, about 2 1/2 years ago, I had just started at a university at that time in my life. I decided to buy an Aneros after reading somewhat incredible tales on their site and forums. Now for those who don't know what this is, to be blunt it's a device you put up your ass. It is shaped to grasp the prostate. The whole idea of going that route to get pleasure kind of was a turn off, and I still don't like that detail. There actually are ways of being really clean and safe about it though if you're careful.

When I first felt full body orgasms from the device, it absolutely blew me away. It actually kind of worried me a bit because it felt so good. The next day after I had my first major experience, I really was worried I had discovered a new form of heroin or something and that I would be hooked. I have since proved to myself that this is non-addictive by abstaining when I need to. I don't let it interfere with my real life.

Anyway, I couldn't find any information on full body orgasms like this outside the website selling the product, so I was pretty much in unknown territory. For at least the first year I would experiment a lot with different models and learn what worked and what didn't. The thing is, it all worked really sporadically during that time, I never knew whether a particular night with it would be heaven, or if nothing would happen at all. I have since learned how to make it work really well, as well as trained my body. I can have mind blowing experiences fairly consistently now. It did take a LOT of practice to get to this level though.

I am going to try to describe what this feels like to someone whose never experienced it. Keep in mind, I wouldn't have believed any of this if I hadn't experienced it personally. There really isn't much info on this anywhere and it's really frustrating. I actually sent an e-mail to a researcher who I looked up after reading an article. (He studies female orgasms as part of his research). He replied and seemed intrigued, but told me he wasn't surprised as some of the nerves that the device stimulates correspond to the nerves in a women's cervix.

So basically there is no semen release, but the orgasms you feel are VERY real. It feels like you literally are cumming, the same “Oh My GOD, I'm all the way there, going over the top” feeling you get when ejaculating, but if anything it's more intense. The thing is, the orgasms keep happening over and over, You are repeatedly brought at and then over the edge again and again. It gets so crazy that when I first started I remember thinking “How is this possible? It should not be happening again” The thing is, with a normal ejaculatory orgasm, there is a refractory period that makes it nearly impossible for men to have multiple orgasms. Not so with this. I try to never go for more than 2 hours though as I actually can be sore the next day.

I don't know how it works or why it works, but It's like.. It keeps happening over and over. The orgasms are not centered in the penis, but you feel it in your whole body in the most incredible way. Sometimes my legs and arms will spasm and twitch as it happens. It has brought me to worlds of pleasure I never knew existed. Sometimes the waves melt together and the feeling becomes near constant. There isn't even a word in the english vocabulary for what you feel when this happens. It's like, you leave the universe and go to a dimension of pleasure far away (experiences like that are still somewhat rare though).

Now, I actually do have a life outside of all of this. I am in college as an Engineer. I have a pretty awesome high paying job waiting on me when I graduate in a year (worked there as an intern and loved it). I don't use this device all the time, I've been forced to abstain for several weeks and months at a time when school gets really hectic (This is partly how I proved to myself that I can do it in moderation. It is non-addictive despite feeling insanely good). I've never told anyone in real life ever about this practice, and I'm almost worried about starting a relationship because I have no idea how a woman would take this. You kind of have to get close to someone to even admit something like this.

Why would I even want a relationship when I have this? Well duh, there are lots of reasons. Orgasms are not everything in life. I want someone I can share these experiences with. I want someone I can be with long term. I actually think these experiences have given me an understanding of pleasure that that most men don't have. I would like to think I could be a great lover because of this, but I don't know. I haven't even pursued a relationship in the past few years partly because I've been so busy with my engineering degree.

Anyway, I've really only posted in forums where people practice this kind of thing regularly. I'm interested in what the more normal people here think of all this... and maybe any tips you might have on how to find someone who wouldn't be freaked out by it.

edit:
*sigh* I guess I should have expected this kind of response. It really is frustrating though. It's really in me to want to argue with each post calling this a shill, but I'm going to refrain from responding to any more of that as I don't see the point. I'm not trying to sell anyone anything here. I only posted my personal experiences. Maybe this really is taboo or something. I guess I should have kept quiet.

edit again:
After reflecting on this a couple more hours, I think I'm flattered much more than upset. Apparently, my sexual experiences are so good that if I post about them people don't believe me and it's downvoted for being fake. How many guys can claim that?"

I am a mechanical engineering student finishing the equivalent of my 3rd year of college, and I just got an offer from Boeing for a summer internship.  I've been sending my resume out left and right, I have a 3.4-3.5 engineering GPA, go to a good engineering school and have loads of work experience in technical fields.  I was really stressing about not getting any offers for this summer, so getting this offer is a huge relief.

That said, the short/vague description that I was given about the internship during the phone interview did not sound particularly interesting.  I'm not saying the internship would be boring, or a waste of time, or anything like that, but it was sure made to sound dull.  Basically, I was told I would be doing a ton of torque and tensions testing on a variety of fasteners on various materials.  The end.

I still am in consideration for 8 other internships with Boeing (and really hoping I get a call back from Tesla Motors for an internship with them), so I don't have to decide right now... and I know how stupid it sounds to reject an offer in hopes of getting a different offer... 

That said, I just would like to hear from some people out in the field that that kind of testing can be far more interesting, and how an internship, even if somewhat dull at a place like Boeing is an opportunity I should jump on.

Hopefully my post makes sense.  I'm still a excited juts from getting the offer on it's own, as not getting one has been a source of stress for quite some time.  "

I have a MacBook Pro (that I paid for last semester) that has the student edition of the creative suite on it, and that's what I've been using to accommodate for the intern.  I have voiced my concern about getting another license, but my request has gone almost completely unheard.

It's been two months now.  Do I have a right to be upset?  And.. is there any other way for me to get my workstation back?

I am writing a proposal for a student-funded fellowship program for mba students at UC Davis.  Here's the deal:
Each summer, MBA students do internships.  Students interested in finance go off and work for investment banks, students interested in marketing go for advertising or market research positions with retailers or biotech/pharmaceutical companies, and students interested in energy business go for spots with utilities.   As you may guess, those internships can pay quite well.  At the same time, there are a few students who are pursue nonprofit, government, or other organizations driven by a social or environmental mission.  Those internships often don't pay at all.

So, what many schools do, is implement a student-funded fellowship program where each student that has a paid internship pledges one (or more) days salary to support the costs of those who take unpaid ones.  The idea is that the few students who commit to supporting the social and environmental bottom lines are supported by the many who are earning well on the economic bottom lines.  Kind of balancing out the 3-legged stool.

OK so this is where you all come in.  I have the proposal all written but I need a name for the fellowship.  Most everything I have come up with is a mouthful or otherwise off-target.  Here are some examples:
Nonprofit Fellowship Fund (name of the narrower program I am proposing to replace),

Social and Environmental Enterprise Fellowship,

Triple Bottom Line Fund,

Socially Responsible Internship Fund.

See, none of these are particularly inspired. Help me.


TL; DR:  help me name a fellowship that will let mba students with paid internships cover costs of students who take unpaid internships but who contribute to making the world better."

I am thinking of applying for my first real job soon, and I'm wondering what really should be in my resumé? This isn't exactly a plush job, it's most likely a minimum wage cashier position at a yogurt shop that is opening near my house. The problem? I'm only a high school sophomore, and I've really only had one relevant position before, last summer I was an intern at a small computer store in another city. Besides that, what can I really put on my resumé? 

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice guys! I'll check again and see if they really want a resume or just a job application. "
c76eg,8,2010-05-23,21-year-old student looking at moving to DC...have a few questions!,scootey,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/c76eg/21yearold_student_looking_at_moving_to_dchave_a/,"Hey all:

I'm looking at possibly moving to DC. I live in Oklahoma right now and would like to move elsewhere (I don't like the particular area I live in, and also feel like going on a bit of an adventure). My dad lives in the Takoma Park area and I will be able to live with him (until I get my own place). I have a few questions, though.

A little about me:

- Presently I live in Oklahoma, and I go to school here studying computer science. I've lived here for a little over half my life.

- I've been to DC a number of times in the past. I have always had family in NoVA and lived near Manassas with my family for a very short time a few years ago. (That was back when I was a lot less outgoing than I am now, so I really can't answer my own questions here.) I'm not very familiar with DC outside of the typical touristy attractions.

- Planning on taking a break from school for the next semester or two, and possibly transferring to another school. I'm not doing as well as I could be doing and need a break to focus myself. I don't like the area that I live in and am not particularly fond of the quality of education at my school either. I want to transfer to UM College Park but I'm not holding my breath.

- I'm an openly gay male; agnostic; fairly liberal politically.

- I'm somewhat nerdy (CS major, redditor...I suppose it's a little implied) but not a recluse either.

How is the DC area for (undergrad) college students in general? I've heard some say that many of the students in the DC area are working on law/medical/other professional degrees or working high-profile internships. Since these people are highly focused on their careers, it might not be the best place for undergrad college students (I'm not suggesting I want to slack off and party all the time…I simply want to find people I can get along with.) How justified is this concern?

Particularly, how good of a fit socially would DC be for someone like me? I figure that finding LGBT-friendly and liberal-minded people really won't be a problem. Will it be hard to fit in if I'm not into bars/clubs that much? I do go out on occasion but it's certainly not my world. What are the people like in DC? Are a lot of people (especially those my age) overly pretentious/snobby/preppy? I'm talking some, but not all, of the people who are attending prestigious universities, working high-profile internships/careers, hipsters, etc.

What sorts of places/activities would be good to meet cool people, especially since I probably won't be going to school for a few months? I might look at getting involved with some sort of LGBT community/activism groups, maybe going to a UU church…any more suggestions?

Also, how is the DC area for internships/jobs related to my area of study (i.e. software development jobs)? I suppose that DC isn't as great of a place for people in technical areas as it is for people in activism/public policy/etc. Certainly there are companies that do software development in the DC area, but how is the job market for CS majors? Do many companies recruit from schools in the area? Would I have a hard time finding a job/internship without a security clearance? Anything else I should know with regard to jobs/careers in my area?

Thanks in advance :)

c76fu,6,2010-05-23,Any ideas on how to make friends?,[deleted],Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/c76fu/any_ideas_on_how_to_make_friends/,"Though I am only here for the summer (intern) living in Newcastle (cheap/best place for me) I am wondering if anyone had any good ideas or things to do in this area to make friends? I have some because I am from WSU and that side of the state, and I have only been here a week so I guess how many people make friends that quick? (my belief is a lot).

 I am from a small east washington town, and as I said went to WSU so my friends were always there if you know what I mean,small classes in school and dorms/roommates in college. I just am not used to asking people to do things or calling asking what is up. 

I enjoy doing almost anything in a group anyways though, I like concerts, sports, being active, I'm 21 so bars/party's, I play some guitar but not great at improvisation and I can play drums, but don't have my set here. Just saying some things that might help narrow it down somewhat. 

I searched for this because I thought I saw it before, but I suck at reddit search, and forgot how to search reddit through google (and I never thought that way worked very well anyways)

tl/dr: Just moved here, looking for friends, wondering the best way to beat ""the freeze"""

I'm currently a second year Computer Engineering student at University.  The Academic Adviser sends out 
emails every few days for various internships at local companies, but they all seem to require mastery of 7 or more 
programming languages before one can even apply.  I currently know how to use Python and Java pretty well, but I 
feel the University only offers other courses in C and C++.  

I am worried that by the time I graduate, I still won't be prepared for various Software Development jobs because I won't be introduced to a large enough variety of languages to meet certain requirements in the workforce.  I was wondering:  Is it really necessary or expected to know so many programming languages in order to get a decent job?

tl;dr- I'm a student overwhelmed by the number of languages Development jobs seem to require.  How necessary is it to learn 7+ languages in order to be even considered for a job?"
c7chk,0,2010-05-23,Wireless Networking special project help,Gregsterman,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c7chk/wireless_networking_special_project_help/,"Hey Reddit,

I'm working on a special project with my parent's wireless home network.  Turns out my summer internship is close enough to my parents' place that I'm going to be living with them and saving on rent... the only problem is their dinosaur of a Linksys WRT54G they have burried in the bottom of the kitchen closet underneath what might as well be a lead bucket for all the signal strength I get in my room at the other end of the house.... 

I purchased a NETGEAR WNDR3700 at BestBuy today to play around with the possibility of using a newer, stronger, more capable and feature-rich router to piggy-back and establish a second, private wireless network in the house just for my computers.  If what I'm outlining below doesn't work, I'm just gonna return the new router and forget the whole thing, but having to wait ~20 minutes for hulu to load is ridiculous. 

NOTE: Hard-wiring is obviously not an option, and I only plan on utilizing the ""wireless-G"" 2.4 GHz capability of the new box. 

I've changed the LAN IP address of the new router to 192.168.1.99 to avoid the conflict with the default address of the dinosaur downstairs.  I also shut off the new box's DHCP server.  Is this all I should watch out for?  Besides the obvious, (modifying the SSID and security settings for the new network) I can't think of anything else that stands in my way of just plugging the new box into one of the old box's ethernet jacks via one of it's own ethernet jacks.  Am I right?

Thanks in advance!

Extra info:  (Will edit to answer questions)

I've changed the wireless channel to 1 for the new network, as the old network is currently configured to use channel 11."

My girlfriend and I are incoming seniors at the same college.  We've been dating since the end of junior year in high school.  This is a new account.

I tell most people that my girlfriend and I have been dating for 4 years, but that isn't the truth.  I suppose I am afraid people will be critical of me and my girlfriend.  She broke up with me last June while away on an internship in another state after 3 years together.  We decided to start dating again 8 months afterward in February of this year. When she returned home from the internship 3 months after she broke up with me, she expressed a desire to date again.  It was difficult to commit again mostly because the break up had been incredibly painful for me.  Immediately prior to the break up, I was going to drive and visit her for her birthday where she was interning in the other state.  I was at work the day before I was to leave when I called her only to find out that she was feeling ""confused about our relationship.""  About 20 minutes later she broke up with me.  I was completely blindsided.  The following 2 months were incredibly difficult, working a crappy job, living alone (she and I had lived together for the previous Spring semester in college), and calling her multiple times only to be told that she didn't want to talk.   Fast forward 3 months to when she returns and though I'm still in pain, she wants to date.  We get close again quickly and sleep together once before she confesses to me that she was in an intimate relationship with some guy who lived next door to her at the internship.  I was crushed and remember driving home that night screaming ""Fuck"" in my car.  The next 5 months felt pretty awkward for me and I suspect she felt pretty awkward too.  I was studying architecture though and the heavy activity helped the time pass without me feeling very lonely.  She did continue to feel lonely though, claiming that she missed me and all of the friends she had made at the internship.  During this time (5 months) she didn't date anyone and called me frequently.

When we decided to start dating again, I clearly remember not being sure of how I felt.  I couldn't and still can't help but imagine her drunk in her apartment that summer with some guy pulling her clothes off and fucking her.  I should mention that she'd been entirely faithful during the duration of our dating.  It still feels like she cheated on me.   

I should also mention that I'm feeling an infrequent low tonight.  She is in Europe for the next 2 weeks with friends and hasn't called for a few days because the cost is too high.  I'm deeply in love with her and I'm sure that she feels a very similar connection with me.  I just have this throbbing sensation I hide from her.  I suppose I'm not sure if relationships survive situations like these in the long term.  She and I are now talking about where we'll be after college and what it means for us.  I sometimes wonder if this is the sort of thing relationships typically grow from.

Has something similar happened to any of you? What did it mean for your relationship?"

(He flew in, rented a car) She claims to be in love with him and went so far as to secretly apply to a university to be close to him.  From what I have been told he has been misleading and manipulative. Nothing about this relationship sounds positive to me, am I wrong to judge?  


All of this is second hand from my parents but I have left out the possible exaggerations and the superfluous. My parents don't know what to do but want to end the relationship.  

I have yet to talk to her about it but I have no idea what to say to her. I'm an XY, btw. I want the relationship to end as well and am afraid she is going to run away to be with him and ruin years of her life.  

XX, what can I say or do that will help my sister realize she needs to end this relationship? Am I and my parents right in thinking this is a bad situation and that it needs to end?  

Thanks ahead of time for the words of wisdom.

**EDIT**: I have confirmed with my sister the fact that he lied about his age (claiming he was younger) when first meeting her."

On the other hand, my best friend is a girl that I've known for about 15 years who lives in another city.  Neither I nor my friend have any romantic aspirations towards each other.  

My girlfriend is going to be heading off to do an internship in another state soon, and the weekend after she leaves, my friend is coming for a visit(she normally visits me once or twice a year, and we usually end up eating until it hurts and playing rock band until our voices die).  My friend's trip was planned around the time I started dating my GF and well before she knew about the GF, so there's no subterfuge involved.

Now, my GF is REALLY uncomfortable with the idea of another girl spending the entire weekend at my place, and I can understand where she's coming from.  Unfortunately, since my GF's about to start that internship out of state and my friend lives in another city, I can't really introduce them to each other to get my GF comfortable with the idea.

My GF's a real gem, and we've already talked about this quite a bit.  She hasn't asked me to cancel my friend's trip, but she'd still unhappy with the whole thing and wants me to brainstorm a magical solution that'll keep everyone happy.  At the same time, my friend is willing to cancel her trip if I can't figure out a way to get my GF comfortable with the trip, but my friend won't be happy about it.

I got an internship for a well known company doing software development. I got this job almost entirely through networking (basically my prof gave me an in). The thing is, I'm not a CS/SE major and my skillset doesn't even come close to my co-workers. I'm taking business with a minor in computer science, but I haven't done any programming for well over a year.


I've been there for 2 weeks and I'm really struggling with it. Since a lot of my team members are global, I have around 2 hours of meetings a day, where I pretty much just sit around twiddling my thumbs because I have no idea about anything they're talking about. I guess I could rationalize by saying this is pretty normal and all the other interns are experiencing the same thing but it feels really shitty to sit around being a mute for 2 hours.
Now my actual work, I'm coding at like snail speed. It's incredibly difficult to jump into the middle of a project that has multiple ten thousand line function lists and being productive when you're working with such knowledgeable and experienced people while I'm sitting there trying to figure out something basic like why this relative path won't work for a good two hours.


I've been trying my best to catch up and have been reading a few PHP books but when I observe some of my team members working on something it's embarrassing how much more productive they are. They are all very nice and answer all my questions, but the questions taht I really want to ask are sometimes so simple I often end up trying to figure it out on my own since I think it would be embarassing to ask. I guess the positive side is that I have an amazing company to put on my resume and I'm learning a ridiculous amount everyday in a challenging and fun environment, but it sure does feel shitty knowing that I can't effectively contribute to my team as much as I want too.


Anyone been in a similar experience? 16 month internship, btw... i want to hopefully make it through all the way without getting canned!"

The key parts:

* There are some circumstances under which individuals who participate in “for-profit” private sector internships 
or training programs may do so without compensation.

* This may apply to interns who receive training for their 
own educational benefit if the training meets certain criteria. 

* The following six criteria must be applied when making this determination

/
1. The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to 
training which would be given in an educational environment; 
2. The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern;  
3. The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff; 
4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; 
and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;  
5. The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and  
6. The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the 
internship.
/

* If all of the factors listed above are met, an employment relationship does not exist under the FLSA, and the 
Act’s minimum wage and overtime provisions do not apply to the intern.

* On the other hand, if the interns are engaged in the operations of the employer or 
are performing productive work (for example, filing, performing other clerical work, or assisting customers), 
then the fact that they may be receiving some benefits in the form of a new skill or improved work habits will 
not exclude them from the FLSA’s minimum wage and overtime requirements because the employer benefits 
from the interns’ work.  

* If an employer uses interns as substitutes for regular workers or to augment its existing workforce during 
specific time periods, these interns should be paid at least the minimum wage and overtime compensation for 
hours worked over forty in a workweek.  If the employer would have hired additional employees or required 
existing staff to work additional hours had the interns not performed the work, then the interns will be viewed as 
employees and entitled compensation under the FLSA

* Conversely, if the employer is providing job shadowing 
opportunities that allow an intern to learn certain functions under the close and constant supervision of regular 
employees, but the intern performs no or minimal work, the activity is more likely to be viewed as a bona fide 
education experience. 

* On the other hand, if the intern receives the same level of supervision as the employer’s 
regular workforce, this would suggest an employment relationship, rather than training.

I go to an engineering school.  Thus, most my friends get summer internships.  I only know of one student who did an unpaid one (I think some of my friends that are getting pure science degrees, as opposed to engineering degrees, may have done unpaid research?  But I think even then there was some money involved).

I suppose I sort of did a bit of technically unpaid work after my sophomore year.  I was doing study abroad in Germany, and I had the opportunity to stay another month, and get another €400 of stipend money, if I did some work on a project at the university for a month.  Other than that, my work has been pretty well compensated.  Not as well as some of my chemical engineer friends (last summer, one of them made $23 an hour + $500 a month for housing!  Lucky sod!), but well enough.

I'm pretty sure liberal art students do unpaid internships frequently; I know one of my friends from high school is doing unpaid research this summer.

So, have you ever done one?  What was your experience?  Did your memorize what sort of coffee every one liked?  Get a million paper cuts from filing?  Do you think it was worth it?  Etc."

Let us assume 50 weeks out of the year, and the minimum wage would be $7.25/hour.

So 2 interns * 20 hours/week * 50 weeks * $7.25/hour = $14,500 savings for Reddit.

Reddit admins will have to spend some time working with the interns, of course, so Reddit will be saving something less than the full amount.

Overall, I think the $14,500 savings is not worth excluding anyone who works for a living and can't afford 20 hours each week for just experience."

Granted, at my college the credits were probably quite a bit cheaper than at a lot of other schools, but we're still talking about quite a chunk of change to pay. And I was paying out of pocket.

Yeah, what a concept. You're paying to work for free. I just think that if the employer wants cheap student labor, they should have to pay for the college credits. The average number of hours required to complete a for-credit internship at my college was 150 hours.

Paying for the credits would be a helluva lot cheaper than paying an actual salary, or even minimum wage!"

The people I work with are great, including my boss. It's a paid internship, and the environment is fantastic. Except, of course, for the SEO stuff.

Is it worth reporting to their parent corporation? It's obviously sleazy and against the code of ethics, but it's nothing illegal. Can I get in trouble if I report it? If I leave it off my resume, is there any way for future employers to find out? What if I apply for a job within the same network?

The company I work for is interested in hiring an intern to help out with the business development.  All of my friends I would recommend already have internships and the other people I know I wouldn't recommend any of them.  I was thinking I might be able to find at least one recommendable person here on Reddit.  If you have a business background and experience, this will be a pretty awesome job. You will be working first hand in expanding a fairly large video game start-up company.  The internship is, of course, unpaid, as is with most startups,(yeah I know it's illegal and normally I wouldn't recommend it but so far the experience has been worth it for me), but this will be great experience for anyone looking to get into the gaming industry.  You will meet a lot of people and get great experience. If you're interested PM me and let me see what you got. I can not promise an internship but I was told today about 10x to find them an intern and I'm pretty sure they value my opinion so, if I recommend you it is a pretty solid bet.

What to do?,thoreauawayacct,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c972w/just_got_into_dream_business_school_requires/,"So I just got into a top 3 business school in the U.S. for International MBA.  I live in Texas and will have to move a few states away (2 hour plane ride, 15 hour car ride).  I am engaged to be married in February 2011 and my fiancee, who has a job here in Texas, does not want to move.  

In addition, I would have to live abroad doing an internship and language study from January - August of 2011 which corresponds directly with our wedding plans.  I have asked her to move and join me wherever I go around the world.  I figured she could save up some money in the mean time and then do ESL or some volunteer stuff she might like while I'm getting my degree.

I really just want her to be there and I'm sure we could make things work if we are together.  Her staying in Texas and me elsewhere for more than a month or two is out of the question.

I'm afraid she'll make me choose between her and the school.  I currently hate my job and know if I don't go to this school, I will be stuck in middle management for my whole life.  I won't be able to support her or a family.  

I don't think 2 years is too much to ask but she is rather resistant to change.  I'm trying to think of compromises etc. but nothing's working.  I need to make a decision by the end of next week!  I really just wish she could handle some fluctuation for 2 years and then we could settle wherever she wants.  Any advice is appreciated.

                           Edit Update.  Thanks for all those who responded.  We spent all weekend talking about this with her brothers and their SOs.  I realize I can't expect her to leave everything behind.  What I hadn't thought of is that this really is more of a lifestyle rather than just a two year inconvenience.  

Essentially, we've decided to see if I can defer for a year (something else I had not thought of) and also see if I get into the local university that has a dual degree program with the number one International Business School in the nation.  That might be an option as I can stay in Texas for a year while doing the first portion of the MBA and then we can move to Arizona for the second year while I get my Masters of Science in Global Management (MSGM).  That way, I'm putting in the same amount of time and getting two degrees.  I'm going to have to talk to someone in the business about whether or not the MSGM at a superior school along with an inferior MBA is better than an IMBA single degree at a great school.  

Just to address some issues, I did talk to her about this possible eventuality the whole time I was applying to schools.  However, we were hoping I would have more options than just this.  Unfortunately, I did not get into any other schools (so far) and that limitation has proved difficult.  I don't know what I'll do if I don't get into the local university AND there is no defer option.  I will probably take temp9876's advice (and Mr. temp9876) and tell her I'm going.  I do have the right to ask the question and she has the right to say no.  I guess you can't have your cake and eat it too.  I would really like her to be with me and supportive through this process, but I know it's asking alot.  

I will update as I get information for anyone who cares.  Thanks again for all the advice."
c98cp,6,2010-05-28,Question about nightmares,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/c98cp/question_about_nightmares/,"I know I should ask a doctor, but I also was curious if anyone had first-hand experience with this before I did that. 

So I know I have some anxiety issues with not being good enough for work and relationships — I am working on better exercise and diet to help with this, as well as counseling — but I was wondering if there would be another reason for my nightmares.

When I was in HS and such, I had stressful dreams too or a lot of dreams that resulted in me sleep walking or waking up REALLY thinking it happened. My mom said it was just lack of sleep that did it. 

Now, at age 20, I'd say the majority of nights I have some sort of dream dealing with being chased, or falling, or me missing a huge deadline or event or something. I always wake up really freaked, and then it takes a while to calm down and go to bed. For example, last night I had a dream I set my bed on fire with a candle (I'm in a town for an internship, so I'm in a new house) and I woke up in a panic throwing my robe on the bed trying to pan the ""flames."" Took me quite a while to get to bed after that. 

I know that example could partially be a new place/new job but it's actually not a stressful move or job change at all, and neither bring much anxiety to me. And all the dreams are more realistic than weird — I'm chased by a robber or something, not a monster or anything. And it's been going on for years (I'm finally accepting my issues, hence the counseling etc.) But I would really rather not go on any meds for sleeping, and I was wondering if it's a dietary issue or something, or if I just need to continue to heal psychologically before this changes. 

TL;DR - I have nightmares. Any potential reason other than in connection to my anxiety? "

No idea where to go from here.,anaccounttothrowaway,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/c9dcj/i_believe_ive_struck_rock_bottom_no_idea_where_to/,"I'm a MSc student. The two year education ends with the presentation and open discussion of my masters thesis. The deadline is scheduled in a week, and my finishing touch to the paper version was done a week ago. Presentation will be in a month.

Since I didn't see my promotor very much and actually had to do the whole thing without advise or guidance from someone well-versed in this particular field, I went on from what I learned myself out of similar studies, books and knowledge from friends in other closely-related fields of science. I finished my dissertation on which I worked 15 months on and off. Altogether, it could be compressed into something like 6 months full-time work (as in 7 day weeks, 12 to 14 hrs per day). For months, I've done nothing but teach myself programming languages, learned how to make my own database server for in silico experimenting, and spent $1350 of my own money on equipment. The model created was backed by in silico and in vitro experiments, all of which I had to do on my own. ALthough I wasn't happy with the lone rider situation, I often messaged my family back home to happily announce my soon to be graduation. I was convinced my hard work would pay off. 

Today, I was very anxious to finally hear my promotors approval. I met with him for the fourth time in the past year, the previous 3 times he either didn't have the time to go through my findings and conclusions or he plainly skipped our meeting. I sent him the complete works (170 pages of text, 200 pages with raw data/appendices/additional methodology, three supplementary material cdroms and my lab notebook) a week earlier. All he tells me today is that he went through only half of the work and isn't happy and expected more of me. He says I will most likely get a good enough grade to pass and get my graduation. But it doesn't meet the standards he signed up for. As such, he doesn't want to sign my entry form. As this is necessary for even being read by the board of assessors, I have nothing. My name won't even be mentioned. I could've as well never existed.

My dissertation won't win a nobel prize, nor will it drop jaws, but its a scientifically correct study validating a new proposed model for future studies. I asked him to go through my lab notebook to see that I really tried a lot of methods and had to suck up to a lot of people to gain access to their lab equipment. He didn't even go over it.

He told me I could work on it for a few months extra, and help out at his department as an intern. I think he is mad at me for refusing to do a PhD at his department, since he applied and gained a grant for me a few months back (although I wasn't notified until the grant came in), which I refused because I desperately need to make back some money my studeis cost me. He is getting at me personally and I can't do this. I cant stand being around the guy or his office. I worked my ass off so I would never have to be in that position anymore. So I left with slamming doors, holding back my tears. I can't even remember when the last time was I cried, but today I did in anger.

I'm fucked. I spent my last money on a rented suit for the graduation and some food for the last weeks. I sold some textbooks and most of my furniture. I have to vacate my room in two days because my lease is up. I'll have to stay at a mate who is going to graduate and I won't. I had a job interview lined up, but a MSc is required. I have no prospects anymore. I don't even know where I'm at right now.

I can't go home to my parents. They put a mortgage on their house so I could study. They aren't living luxuriously, and neither have I because I know what a strain the paying for my eductaion is to them. I can't face my little brother. I was supposed to bring in money so he can go to college in a few years. Everyone put so much effort in me, and I have nothing in return. I haven't seen them in two years. They wouldn't even come over for my graduation in a month, just to save money for Tims college fees.

I don't know what to do. I'm angry and confused right now, so I can't get my mind round anything. My mate has gone through the regulations and claims I can't take actions towards my promotor without consequences. One of them would be that I have to do my dissertation for someone else thus start all over. I'm stuck here.

Please tell me there is something else I can do but go back and beg that asshole. I just want to give it all up, move away from here and get a real job."

I met this girl last October on Omegle. As our relationship grew, we talked on video chat, on the phone and through text message. We're both Sophomores, soon to be Juniors, in college. I left a week ago to go see her for 6 days, got back yesterday, and now it's all I can think about.

Before going out there, she and I definitely had an emotional ande a physical attraction to each other, so lots of physical things were discussed. Every night while there, I stayed in her bed. However, after showing up, she made it clear that she didn't want to engage in anything physical with any guy she wasn't in a relationship with, and she didn't want to be in a long-distance cross-country relationship with me. She was hurt about some douche taking advantage of her while she was drunk at a party. This was a bummer, but I dealt with it. The second to last night I was there, our faces ended up close to one-another, and I asked if I could kiss her. Things moved on big time from there, she took her shirt off, and I worked my magic downstairs. After she felt like things were enough for her, she said ""I'm a cock tease"" and went to bed, which is kind of a blueballsing situation. Before she went to bed, she told me that I shouldn't have expected reciprocal pleasure because it doesn't work like that. I was kind of bummed about this, but she's more experienced (more on this later) than me. She also said that she didn't want to do anything else, she didn't want to become too attached to me, so she was going to stop the next time if it seemed like it was happening.

3 hours later a very similar thing happens in the middle of the night, I'm pleasuring her, she doesn't do it for me, we go to bed. The next day, she says that while it was great, she doesn't want to become attached and that next time she'll have to say ""no"". 

While we're taking a nap, one thing leads to another, and the same thing ends up happening. I pleasure her, she doesn't do so for me, and we resume the nap. She then asserts her point again about stopping the act next time, because she doesn't want to get attached.

That night, my last night, things happen again in a very similar manner, probably the most hardcore of the times, but still no pleasure for me. When I mention it, she says ""maybe we should stop if that's where you want this to lead"". She takes me to the airport that morning.

I kind of hope that she did get attached to me while I was there. I really do.

So yes, this girl is also way more sexually experienced than me. She's slept with 7 guys and 2 girls. I've never slept with anyone, had my first kiss at 18, and was with the second girl I've ever engaged with physically or kissed just a few days ago. 

I'm fucking depressed by the entire situation. I want to be with her, but if she doesn't want to be in a relationship, it'll crush me. There is definite attraction on both an emotional and a physical level, and she kept telling me how nice of a guy I am and how great I am. Sadly, I go to a tech school on the opposite end of the country, and my home is smack dab in the middle of the US. She has lots of guys there pining for her, none of whom she's interested in, but still. There are next to no girls at my school, and it's practically impossible to find one. I know that when I was in my first relationship (freshman year of college) I just seemed to be happier, to be able to be that intimate and open with someone is a big deal to me, to be able to always have somebody to turn to or talk to. Right now I feel really alone, having just left this girl yesterday, and I don't know what to do or how to feel better. Perhaps this doesn't belong in relationship_advice, perhaps it does, I'm just hoping a smart redditor comes along and helps me with my problem(s) so I can either pursue a relationship with her, or be okay with not doing so. I work out, and I have a very exciting internship this summer, so telling me to get off my ass won't carry much weight.

Any idea reddit? "
c9qwf,1,2010-05-30,"Hey Reddit, I need your help in trying to convince my girlfriend to have a good online identity to help her with her career hunt.",IAmAnon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9qwf/hey_reddit_i_need_your_help_in_trying_to_convince/,"**Here is my story:**

I am a web developer who maintains an online portfolio and an identity via my website/linkedIn/Twitter. 

My Girlfriend is a recent graduate from a Business and Management Degree in London; she has done some good project work in the past and had an internship from a very famous soft drink company. She is the sort of person who can NOT sit idle and always needs to be doing something, so she is kind of freaking out about getting a job soon.

Now I'm trying to build her a website which has details about her previous project works, and a blog about the various activities she has done regarding her education, projects and internship. I really believe this is going to give her more possibilities of landing a new job as well as give her a place on the intertubes.


**Now here is the problem:**

I can't get her to understand WHY she needs an online identity. She wants to know why I am making this website for her. And she actually wants me to stop doing this because she sees no point whatsoever.

These are her reasons:

* She strongly believes that online profiles are needed for ""techie"" people only and since she is a business and management oriented person she will get no use out of it.

* I tried to explain her that modern day HR's search for a person's online activities when they go through the hiring process and it's going to help her a lot when they see her professional website with all her past work details. But she is a think that only the HR's hiring for a technical position would bother to do that.

* She also says that if making online identity helped someone they people would pay others to make it for them and might even enter fake achievements. To which I counter argued that you could do the same fakery with your CV.  So then she says ""Hence there is no point in making a website""

So am I wrong here? Is there really no profit for a non-technical person to build a website to potentially attract employers?

I need some solid proofs for her, so a confirmation from an HR would help GREATLY. Also any articles giving out facts about this would help.

Please help me out Reddit :-)

**TLDR:** My business graduate girlfriend thinks maintaining an online profile for potential employers is only for technical people. I need to prove her otherwise."

c9smm,1,2010-05-31,How do I deal with people like this?,jetplane42,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c9smm/how_do_i_deal_with_people_like_this/,"Yes, it's a throwaway.  I'm 19, just finished my first year of college, and intern for a major IT consulting company.  I absolutely love my job.  Now that it's the summer, I'm working full time and am no longer an intern.  One of our major clients is a school district, comprised of six different schools, including a high school.  Two days a week for the next few weeks, I'm on site deploying new software on all of the computers.  This involves entering each classroom during class time and touching the teacher's computer and any student computers that are in the room.
The other day, I was on site, and getting lunch at a local burger place by myself, when I saw four built, football player-type kids eating, whom I had seen earlier that day in class.  Now, I am required to dress nicely for the job.  I'm well groomed, and I dress well.  I am certainly not gay nor do I project any sort of gay vibe, to my knowledge.  This particular day was simply a fitted dress shirt and slacks.  The moment I walk in, one of the kids turns to me, and goes ""Wow, you're cute"".  I kinda look at him, and he goes ""just kidding"" and turns around to eat, while his friends snicker.  I blow it off as kids being stupid and go to order. On my way out, they say the same thing as I'm walking out the door. I keep walking.
Two days later, I'm on site again, and see the same four waiting for me outside of the school.  I walk by, and after I pass, they yell the same.  I turn around, and one of them yells ""DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, FAGGOT"".  I kept walking and ignored them again.
I'm about 5'11"" and a climber.  I'm in good shape, but not built.  I couldn't take any of these kids, assuming that confrontation is even the best option in this scenario, although it might be what my testosterone suggests...  Obviously, they're minors and I am a contractor for the school, so anything of that nature would definitely not rule in my favor.  I feel shitty ignoring these kids, it's hard to do.  I don't want to ""tell"" on anybody.  What do, reddt?"
c9zxq,7,2010-05-31,Got an Interview for an internship for Disney. What should I expect?,scootypuffjr,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/c9zxq/got_an_interview_for_an_internship_for_disney/,"Over the past few weeks, I've had a phone screening interview with an HR rep and then I recently got a phone interview with a Disney engineer employee. Now I just got another interview, but in person this time. 

I've never gotten this far in an interviewing process and I'm really nervous. I really want to get this internship with Disney. What kind of questions should I be expecting? The engineer I talked to over the phone asked me a few technical questions (which imo, I completely blotched the answers). Should I be studying up on the material I learned in classes to prepare for more technical questions? Or should I just expect another typical interview with situational questions, etc.?

Thanks!"
